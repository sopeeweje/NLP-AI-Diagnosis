"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9798264,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'axonal guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,384007,0.028999822157134456
"Quantifying causality for neuroscience Abstract: Causality is central to neuroscience. For example, we might ask about the causal effect of a neuron on another neuron, or its influence on perception, action, or cognition. Moreover, any medical approaches aim at producing a causal effect – effecting improvements for patients. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard to establish causality, but they are not always practical. For example, while we can electrically or optogenetically activate entire areas, large-scale targeted stimulation of individual neurons is hard. Other ways of establishing causality are problematic: if we observe a correlation it is hard to know its cause. The problem is confounding: there are variables that we do not record that affect the variables we do. This also renders model comparisons problematic – a causally wrong model with few parameters may well fit the observed data better than a causally correct one with many parameters. We thus need data analysis tools that allow authoritatively asking causal questions without the need for random perturbation experiments.  Just like neuroscience now, the field of econometrics once focused on correlations. But since the 1980s, empirical economics has undergone a so-called credibility revolution, requiring the development of rigorous methods to establish causality. Several successful methods have emerged to become the workhorses of empirical economics. The idea underlying these methods is that if one can observe variables that approximate random perturbations, then one can still discover causal relations. This is what economists call a quasi-experiment. We here propose to carry over such quasi-experimental techniques to neuroscience. For example in neuroscience, if there is a random variable that affects only one neuron, then any activity in other neurons correlated with that variable must be causally affected by the neuron. Another famous quasi- experimental method is regression discontinuity design (RDD). This approach effectively uses the noise introduced at the threshold to identify causal relations. Importantly, such techniques have, thanks to decades of research in econometrics, very well understood statistical properties. These approaches promise to considerably enrich the approaches towards causality we have in neuroscience. We have a strong interdisciplinary team, spanning economics, experimental, and computational neuroscience, collaborating on adapting these quasi-experimental techniques to problems in neuroscience through a combination of machine learning and domain-specific engineering. This promises to be a major advance relative to current techniques that generally approach causality in neuroscience through model comparison. Project Narrative: The goal of this project is to develop a set of computational techniques that allow neuroscientists to quantify how neurons causally influence one another. To do so, it utilizes approaches popular in econometrics called quasiexperiments.

"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools.

"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9730628,R01NS091421,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'feature detection', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,381916,0.030464036614547205
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9650637,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2019,199118,-0.038873035929291117
"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain.

"In vivo Imaging of Neuroactivity in the Deep Forward Scattering Regime Using Speckle Identification and Demixing (SPID) Microscopy PROJECT SUMMARY Optical imaging of neuronal activity in the mammalian brain at depth and at high spatial and temporal resolution remains a key challenge in neuroscience. This is because tissue scattering eliminates directional information carried by photons, with a characteristic length scale of hundreds of microns. As a result, the remaining unscattered, or “ballistic” component of light decays exponentially with depth. Since all optical microscopy modalities rely—either in the excitation or the emission—on this ballistic component of light for image formation, the limitations imposed by scattering limit the maximally obtainable imaging depths to ~1.5 mm in the rodent brain. Hereby, we propose a systematic approach for exploring and developing a new platform for in vivo deep tissue calcium imaging that actively exploits the scattering properties of the tissue as a resource to localize, demix and extract neuronal activity traces in the millimeter depth range in the highly scattering rodent brain. Our approach utilizes the fact that the scattering process results in an accumulation of different relative phases between scattered light components, leading to the formation of deterministic but complex interference patterns known as speckles. Emission from different locations of the sample results in speckles with different intensity distributions. Thus, these patterns carry complex information about both the location of the emitter and the properties of the scattering medium. Our current results show that the obtainable contrast for these speckle patterns should be sufficient to identify, localize and demix them even for extended objects and with partially coherent light. We will design and build an array of hardware and computational tools that will allow us to systematically explore the limits within which such demixing and neuronal signal extraction can be achieved in vivo. We will use these insights and develop an optical platform for volumetric calcium imaging in the mouse brain in the deep forward-scattering regime, as well as for transcranial calcium imaging in the mouse brain. Our approach will synergistically combine the expertise on the physics of light propagation in disordered media in the Gigan Lab with the experience in machine learning, computational imaging and in vivo high-speed volumetric neuronal recording in the Vaziri Lab. Our method has the potential of opening up a new paradigm for neuronal imagining and signal extraction in the multiple scattering regime by enabling millimeter-range calcium imaging in the highly scattering rodent brain.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9775212,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,628430,0.09151132820442066
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Accessible technologies for high-throughput, whole-brain reconstructions of molecularly characterized mammalian neurons SUMMARY The BRAIN Initiative seeks to accelerate the development and application of innovative technologies that ultimately will revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. A central current focus of the brain initiative is to enable a swift and comprehensive survey of all brain cell types and circuits. Recently, single cell transcriptomics is helping to classify cell types by their expression patterns. Transcriptomic analysis is currently unique in that it scales to the entire mouse brain and all cell types. However, the correspondence between transcriptomic clusters and cell types, as defined by connectivity or physiology, is not clear. Classification of cell types will require integrative analysis of at least two data elements at the cellular level: (1) molecular signature (e.g., transcriptome), (2) anatomy (e.g., location, morphology, connectivity). We therefore propose here to elevate the complete reconstruction of the morphology of molecularly defined neurons from a small-scale artisanal method to a technology that scales to the analysis of all neuron types across the entire brain thereby providing critical information about cell types, neuronal structure and connectivity. To achieve this goal, we will build on an existing research partnership between the Departments of Neuroscience and Biomedial Engineering at Johns Hopkins University and Janelia Research Campus to develop novel tools for the reconstruction of molecularly defined neuronal subtypes. We will develop scalable imaging technology and neuro-informatics tools for morpho-molecular analysis that will be made available to researchers for a community wide effort of the mapping of all neuronal cell types and connections at and unprecedented scale and depth. Preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of our approach that will be further developed to enhance speed on a generally usable platform. We will also develop affordable tools for data storage and retrieval. Molecular identification of neurons is designed to take advantage of information from the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN) to integrate data across platforms into a common Brain Atlas. Data collected in this proposal will be integrated into the searchable BICCN database at the Allen Brain Institute.

"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,9882822,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2019,390806,0.03156486291971435
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9625167,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,526760,0.022159253956348615
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others.

"Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning. PROJECT SUMMARY Synaptic dysfunction is a common feature of neuropsychiatric disease. For example, a hallmark of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s is synaptic fibrilization and aggregation of key proteins that participate in synapse and cell loss. Maladaptive plastic changes in synapse structure and function underlie key aspects of behavioral and mood disorders ranging from addiction to depression, as well as neurodevelopmental diseases like schizophrenia and autism. It is for these reasons that many investigators across a range of neuroscience disciplines study the synapse, and the reason that new tools to study synapse structure and function within neural circuits of interest are sorely needed. Indeed, current tools to assess synapse structure in defined cell types are not readily compatible with state-of-the-art 3D volume approaches such as serial block face scanning electron microscopy, and are severely hampered by inadequate computational tools for quantitative assessment of these massive datasets. However, advances in molecular genetics, optics, engineering and computing provide new opportunities to develop information rich strategies to peer into the synapse. Here, we combine such advances to achieve a new state-of-the-art in imaging and analyzing microcircuit connectivity and synapse structure within neurotransmitter-defined neural networks. Specifically, we leverage the fact that the bulk of signaling across the synapse is mediated by a relatively small population of small molecule neurotransmitters that are synthesized and packaged into synaptic vesicles at the site of release in axonal compartments. The bulk of neurotransmission is thus dependent on just seven well- described vesicular transporters expressed in brain. Our overall goal is to build a rigorous, easily deployable, cell-type-specific, expandable, multi-functional toolkit for imaging and quantifying neurotransmitter-defined synaptic connections by both light and electron microscopy in mice. To accomplish this, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 to insert electron microscopy-compatible tags into native vesicular transporters (Aim 1), establish simplified procedures for their monochrome and ‘multicolor’ labeling in 3D ultrastructure (Aim 2), and computational tools for automated segmentation and quantitative analysis of key pre- and post-synaptic metrics (Aim 3). Though these Aims are independently meritorious, by synthesizing them we aim to generate a complete toolkit that will allow investigators to render neurotransmitter-defined circuit connections into 3D ultrastructure datasets with automated quantitative assessment of key features of pre- and post-synaptic structure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synaptic and structural dysfunction are causally related to both the causes and symptoms of neuropsychiatric illness ranging from Alzheimer’s disease to addiction and depression. Modern advances in molecular genetics, engineering, materials, and computer sciences have created new opportunities to understand how brain dysfunction gives rise to disease. Here, we leverage these interdisciplinary advances to develop new probes, new methods, and new analysis pipelines to study the normal and pathological structure and function of synaptically coupled brain cells.",Developing new tools for high throughput analysis of microcircuits and synapse ultrastructure using tagged vesicular transporters and deep learning.,9822844,RF1MH120685,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acetylcholine', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chelating Agents', 'Chemicals', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Deposition', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electron energy loss spectroscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunoelectron Microscopy', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lanthanoid Series Elements', 'Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Optics', 'Oxides', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Purines', 'Recycling', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'Vesicle', 'Viral', 'Viral Vector', 'Western Blotting', 'addiction', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'light microscopy', 'materials science', 'monoamine', 'nanoscale', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'neurotransmission', 'peer', 'polymerization', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'small molecule', 'synaptic function', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",RF1,2019,2509965,-0.0008068811429435035
"COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: Decentralized, Scalable Analysis of Loosely Coupled Data",9938885,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'commune', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data anonymization', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585151,0.05100032897765805
"Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to develop a widely adoptable, high-throughput, functional connectomics platform to semi-automatically reconstruct and analyze the synaptic connectivity of functionally characterized neuronal microcircuits. We will develop this pipeline in the context of understanding neural microcircuits that control walking, using the Drosophila ventral nerve cord (VNC) as a model system. The VNC constitutes over a third of the fly central nervous system, and functions like the spinal cord to control movement and sensation of the limbs. It has a tractable number of neurons (~60,000), many of which are genetically identified and anatomically stereotyped, making it an excellent brain region for developing a comprehensive approach to characterize neuronal circuits. Our approach will integrate several technologies from our labs, including in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in walking flies, high-throughput transmission electron microscopy (EM), automated, deep- learning based connectomic reconstruction, and cell morphology-based analytics. Using this pipeline we will generate the first dense functional connectomes of the VNC, including the sensorimotor leg circuitry from multiple male and female flies. We will use these data to test the hypothesis that there exist specific patterns of synaptic connectivity between functional subtypes of leg proprioceptors and motor neurons. By creating the first connectomes of a microcircuit that orchestrates walking behavior, we anticipate this project will provide new and fundamental insight into the circuit basis of sensorimotor transformation and motor control. It will also create an important resource for the Drosophila and neuroscience communities, through publicly available tools and datasets that integrate connectivity, morphology, and cellular physiology data. Moreover, the technical approaches we develop for high-throughput functional connectomics can be readily applied to other brain regions and across species. Project Narrative Detailed mapping of neural computations and the neuronal circuits that underlie them is crucial for a comprehensive understanding central nervous system function in health and disease. Our goal is to develop an accessible, high-throughput pipeline of tools that we will use to dissect the relationship between neuronal connectivity and function in circuits that control walking. We will focus on sensorimotor transformations in the tractable genetic model organism Drosophila to dissect fundamental principles of proprioceptive feedback in motor control, while improving the speed and accessibility of functional connectomics for the broader scientific community.",Tools to broaden access to high-throughput functional connectomics,9822460,RF1MH117808,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrical Synapse', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Leg', 'Limb structure', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Property', 'Proprioceptor', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeleton', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Walking', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'light microscopy', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor neuron function', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sex', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'two-photon']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2019,4347595,0.02386449318486503
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,0.021124422453059264
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing. New applications of these tools this will lead deeper insight into the role of networks in health as well as in clinical disorders.",CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience,9916138,R01EB029272,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Elements', 'France', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Sociology', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'analysis pipeline', 'brain computer interface', 'cloud based', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'open data', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2019,215134,0.03213325341167667
"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9733348,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual technology']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2019,379357,0.02805825029063697
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,0.003956673370111565
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9509569,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,375839,0.030464036614547205
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9591465,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2018,507643,-0.0030270796038616766
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,9594042,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,661507,0.09151132820442066
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain.

"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9474101,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'human microbiota', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'operational taxonomic units', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbial community', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2018,350321,0.003904906057727039
"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 µm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume.

Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasets—essentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out ‘virtual experiments.’ Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior.

"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9471853,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2018,536521,0.022159253956348615
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution. ECOG generates staggering amounts of data, and the rate-limiting step in generating new insights about the human brain is the difficulty in exploring this vast quantity of data.

"High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system The Princeton Neuroscience Institute (PNI) proposes to build a high-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) system. Two-photon calcium imaging of neurons in behaving animals is important for many projects at Princeton, including several that are part of the U.S. BRAIN Initiative. The technique is being applied to large neural populations distributed across the entire nervous systems of small animals (worm, ?y, or larval zebra?sh), as well as to particular regions of the mouse brain (neocortex, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia). These large-scale observations of neural activity are conducted while the animal is performing complex behaviors such as navigation, decisionmaking, and courtship. The TEM system would add large-scale anatomical information with unprecedented resolution and completeness. The extremely high throughput of the system would make it routine to perform serial section TEM imaging of the entire brain for small animals, or of large brain regions for the mouse. It would be possible to directly relate anatomy and physiology by applying two-photon calcium imaging and TEM to exactly the same neurons. In the past, this combined approach has been hindered by the fact that 3D EM imaging generates a huge amount of data and has taken months or years for even a small volume. The system will be fast enough to produce a petabyte in a few months, enough for a millimeter-scale brain volume. PNI is one of the few places in the world that is ready to handle petascale datasets, as PNI has recently received funding from IARPA to scale up EM image analysis techniques, including deep learning and crowdsourcing. The instrument will be housed in the Bezos Center for Neural Circuit Dynamics, in the basement of the new PNI building. The Bezos Center already provides two-photon microscopy technologies to laboratories at PNI, and would become an even more important resource with the TEM system. Combined with existing capabilities in two-photon calcium imaging, the MultiSEM will enable the Princeton Neuroscience Institute to relate the structure and function of neural circuits. This should improve our understanding of normal brain function, and aid in understanding brain diseases that are caused by miswired or degenerated neural circuits.",High-throughput parallel transmission electron microscopy system,9494063,S10OD023602,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Courtship', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscope', 'Funding', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Medial', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Zebrafish', 'brain volume', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'instrument', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'petabyte', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'two-photon']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,S10,2018,2000000,-0.007015748741855255
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community be- comes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informat- ics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an inde- pendent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented stor- age vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and pri- vacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix fac- torization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. 4 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don’t have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this ‘missing data’ and allow for pooling of both open and ‘closed’ repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed compu- tational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms. 3","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9717051,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,282320,0.04968158342582833
"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.)

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process.

"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9534670,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,423985,0.06703371512947326
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy.

"2/2-Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population.

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9546689,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,332220,0.03844622526505069
"Physical modeling of biological systems In collaboration with a Senior Investigator in the Axon Guidance and Neural Connectivity Section, NINDS, and with his post-doctoral fellow, and with members of the Biomedical Imaging Research Services Section of the Office of Intramural Research, CIT, we are studying the mechanisms that guide neurons axons to their ultimate targets. In particular, we are analyzing experiments that record the the growth of a neuron in the wing disc extracted from Drosophlia larvae. During these experiments, we monitor the dynamics of a cytoskeletal protein, actin, at sub-micrometer resolution for periods up to an 1.5 hours in the growing axon as it senses it way through the muscle tissue of the disc. We are also examining the effects on the axon growth dynamics by mutations in a kinase that modulates the actin activity. An article is in preparation for submission to peer review. Furthermore, we are studying new techniques to increase the imaging sampling rate cellular cytoskeletal dynamics while reducing the damage to the cells being observed.  In collaboration with a principal investigator and staff clinician in Section on Clinical Psychoneuroendocrinology and Neuropsychopharmacology, National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and with a staff scientist in the Mathematical and Statistical Laboratory, Office of Intramural Research, CIT, we are studying the factors that influence patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) to seek treatment. This study involves analysis of hundreds of environmental, physiological, and psychiatric factors collected for each patient. A manuscript describing an alternative decision tree for predicting the propensity of AUD patients to seek or not seek treatment (and that could be use by the AUD treatment providers in the field) has been submitted for peer-review. In addition, we are applying methods from information theory to explore the spectrum of these factors in the AUD population.  In collaboration with a consortium of investigators consisting of (1) a principal investigator and staff clinician in Section on Clinical Psychoneuroendocrinology and Neuropsychopharmacology, National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, (2) a principal investigator and staff clinician in Cognitive Neuroscience and Psychopharmacology Section, Neuroimaging Research Branch, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and (3) a staff scientist in the Mathematical and Statistical Laboratory, Office of Intramural Research, CIT, we are investigating differences in the decision making process between addicts and non-addicts. In particular, we are comparing cigarette smokers, cocaine users, and a set of non-smoking, non-addicted controls to each other. We study their decision making process using a ""trust game"" approach in which players (the subjects) decide whether or not to trust each other or a randomized computer algorithm in dispensing financial gains or penalties. Our preliminary results suggest that cocaine users respond differently from non-using controls and cigarette smokers, especially in the initial stages of the game.  From 2012 to 2017, the LI worked with a principal investigator in Section on Neuronal Connectivity, NICHD, (Chi-hon Lee) on statistical and topological analysis of retinal neurons growth in Drosophila. In FY 2018, Dr. Lee left the NIH to become the director of the Institute of Cellular and Organismic Biology, Academia Sinica, in Taipai, Taiwan. The LI and Dr. Lee, along with (1) a staff scientist in NICHD, and (2) members of the Biomedical Imaging Research Services Section of the Division of Computational Bioscience, CIT, are now finishing up their long-term collaboration.

"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9568023,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2018,386960,0.02805825029063697
"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease.

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9292377,R01MH109177,"['Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'developmental psychology', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,373529,0.008232510011142356
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9310363,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,363754,0.030464036614547205
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9270498,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2017,311153,0.003904906057727039
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9278954,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2017,205185,-0.038873035929291117
"Mapping the synaptic connectivity and function of sensory neuronal circuits Experimental Progress  Zebrafish visual behaviors:  We are preparing a manuscript describing the combinatorial coding properties of neurons in the larval zebrafish optic tectum. The collection of large scale electron microscopy data from a functionally characterized tectum is underway.  Neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb:  We are preparing a manuscript describing the connectivity patterns between adult born neurons and projection neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb using a combination of optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches.  We are also preparing a manuscript describing a novel method to allow penetration of antibodies into thick tissue sections with minimal disruption to tissue ultrastructure. This method has been used to triple immunohistochemically label periglomerular cells in the mouse olfactory bulb. We completed the collection of a large electron microscopy of this tissue and are in the process of analyzing the dense connectivity patterns of periglomerular cells in olfactory bulb glomeruli.   EM analysis of retinal circuitry:  A collaboration with the labs of Dr. Rob Smith and Dr. Jeff Diamond led to a publication that appeared in Nature in 2016. In this study we identified a species-specific wiring difference in the direction-selective circuitry of mice and rabbits. This wiring pattern difference compensates for their substantially different  eye diameters and allows the two species to encode similar angular velocities in visual space.   Technical Progress  Development of custom serial-block face microtome:  An application was filed to license our serial block-face microtome and a licensing agreement is pending.  3D EM data analysis:  We have pursued two avenues to aid the automated analysis of 3D EM data. On the experimental side, we conducted a study examining the benefits of preserving the extracellular space during chemical tissue fixation that is normally lost. We have confirmed that the preservation of extracellular space improves the automated segmentation of 2D and 3D EM volumes. A manuscript describing this method was published in Elife in 2015.  On the data analysis side, we have scaled up our machine learning-based data analysis pipeline to be able to segment terabyte-scale datasets. We are currently using the pipeline to analyze the recently acquired mouse olfactory bulb dataset.   Web based Proofreading Tool:  Our web based EM segmentation proofreading tool is online and externally accessible. We added a tutorial to demonstrate how to use the site. We are using the tool to accumulate more training data for the neural networks. n/a",Mapping the synaptic connectivity and function of sensory neuronal circuits,9563167,ZIANS003133,"['Adult', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Preservation', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diamond', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Extracellular Space', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microtome - medical device', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Online Systems', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Retinal', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Tectum Mesencephali', 'Thick', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurogenesis', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'scale up', 'superior colliculus Corpora quadrigemina', 'terabyte', 'tool']",NINDS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,ZIA,2017,1746028,0.012873973721366968
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9311535,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,580007,0.022159253956348615
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics. Our computational approaches and algorithms will help scientists analyze a wide range of neuroimaging and behavioral data, which will lead to the capability to discover therapeutic and pharmacological targets for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders.",Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization,9360104,R01EB022911,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Event', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain pathway', 'cognitive control', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'information model', 'information processing', 'insight', 'large scale simulation', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,393836,-0.0030660687207971164
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9268713,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'commune', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,655080,0.05162848092088944
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data.

"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy. Understanding rules underlying cell type-specific neuronal connectivity may help to reveal how the brain is altered in neurodegenerative disorders, specific cell types that are affected, and guide effective treatment strategies.",Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform,9379329,RF1MH114047,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebellar Diseases', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Peroxidases', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'ascorbate', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'imaging approach', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'motor control', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'next generation', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'serial imaging', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2017,1271250,0.017883076244408803
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9360109,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,425138,0.06703371512947326
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9310382,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,323033,0.02936267877846752
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9360116,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,332220,0.03844622526505069

"SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy Project Abstract Advances in imaging have had a profound effect on our ability to generate high-resolution measurements of the brain’s structure. One of the major hurdles in processing modern neuroimaging datasets designed to produce large-scale maps of the connections and the organization of the brain lies in the sheer size of these data. For instance, electron microscopic (EM) images of a cubic millimeter of cortex occupies roughly 3 PBon disk, and lower resolution emerging X-ray microtomography (XRM) data can exceed 10 TB for a single mouse brain. When dealing with datasets of this size, the application of even simple algorithms becomes difficult. The size of datasets also exacerbates the considerable challenges for dissemination, reproducibility, and collaboration across laboratories. Addressing these challenges requires a new approach that leverages state-of-the-art computer science technology while remaining conscientious of the underlying bioinformatics. We propose Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research (SABER), a user-friendly and portable framework that automates the retrieval, extraction, and analysis of large-scale imagery data to facilitate neuroscientific analyses. SABER aims to improve the reliability and reproducibility of neuroimagery research by providing a common substrate upon which algorithms may be developed. Leveraging SABER’s containers — a standardized packaging for software — this substrate can then be trivially transferred to other machines by the same researcher or by other teams aiming to reproduce or adapt the prior work, making sharing workflows and extracting knowledge commonplace. Using SABER will ensure that the analysis runs identically, regardless of by whom or where the workflow is executed. Because developing and deploying these analysis solutions for large image volumes are acute barriers to developing consistently reproducible workflows, SABER will further the neuroscientific analysis community by simplifying the workflow-development and workflow-execution steps. To demonstrate this, we plan to distribute two community-vetted, optimized workflows to convert large-scale EM and XRM volumetric imagery into maps of neuronal connectivity. Many neurological diseases are characterized by their impact on the density of cells and vessels, neuron death, connectivity, or other factors that are visible with imaging technologies. SABER will provide a framework for producing reproducible estimates of cell counts, vasculature density, and connectomes, thus enabling increased understanding of the impact of disease on the neuroanatomy of many brains. This work will enable the development of tools that can both be applied to massive data and shared amongst many scientists, which will in turn accelerate progress and neuroscientific discovery. Project Narrative: Our Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory team leverages prior neuroscience analysis experience to present SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research — a portable, easy-to-install framework that enables large-scale neuroanatomical data processing by providing a scaffold upon which highly-reproducible bioinformatics protocols may be built. To support emerging efforts to understand the biological basis of disease, we demonstrate turn-key pipelines to translate multi-terabyte electron microscopy and X-ray microtomography data volumes into maps of neuronal connectivity.",SABER: Scalable Analytics for Brain Exploration Research using X-Ray Microtomography and Electron Microscopy,9414126,R24MH114799,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Arm', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Density', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Pluto', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'brain research', 'brain tissue', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data access', 'data archive', 'data management', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuron loss', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R24,2017,395542,0.02805825029063697
"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9126614,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,384420,0.008232510011142356
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9136881,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,352019,0.030464036614547205
"Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research Abstract We propose a three-year interdisciplinary research plan to address two key issues currently facing the metagenomics community. The first issue concerns accurate construction and annotation of OTU tables using  of millions of 16S rRNA sequences, which is one of the most important yet most difficult problems inmicrobiome data analysis. Currently, it lacks computational algorithms capable of handling extremely large sequence data and constructing biologically consistent OTU tables. We propose a novel method that performs OTU table construction and annotation simultaneously by utilizing input and reference sequences, reference annotations, and data clustering structure within one analytical framework. Dynamic data-driven cutoffs are derived to identify OTUs that are consistent not only with data clustering structure but also with reference annotations. When successfully implemented, our method will generally address the computational needs of processing hundreds of millions of 16S rRNA reads that are currently being generated by large-scale studies. The second issue concerns developing novel methods to extract pertinent information from massive sequence data, thereby facilitating the field shifting from descriptive research to mechanistic studies. We are particularly interested in microbial community dynamics analysis, which can provide a wealth of insight into disease development unattainable through a static experiment design, and lays a critical foundation for developing probiotic and antibiotic strategies to manipulate microbial communities. Traditionally, system dynamics is approached through time-course studies. However, due to economical and logistical constraints, time-course studies are generally limited by the number of samples examined and the time period followed. With the rapid development of sequencing technology, many thousands of samples are being collected in large-scale studies. This provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a novel analytical strategy to use static data, instead of time-course data, to study microbial community dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first time that massive static data is used to study dynamic aspects of microbial communities. When successfully implemented, our approach can effectively overcome the sampling limitation of time-course studies, and opens a new avenue of research to study microbial dynamics underlying disease development without performing a resource-intensive time-course study. The proposed pipeline will be intensively tested on a large oral microbiome dataset consisting of ~2,600 subgingival samples (~330M reads). The analysis can significantly advance our understanding of dynamic behaviors of oral microbial communities possibly contributing to the development of periodontal disease. To our knowledge, no prior work has been performed on this scale to study oral microbial community dynamics. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that covers expertise spanning the areas of machine learning, bioinformatics, and oral microbiology. The expected outcome of this work will be a set of computational tools of high utility for the microbiology community and beyond. The human microbiome plays essential roles in many important physiological processes. We propose an interdisciplinary research plan to address some major computational challenges in current microbiome research. If successfully implemented, this work could significantly expand the capacity of existing pipelines for large-scale data analysis and scientific discovery, resulting in a significant impact on the field.",Developing Advanced Algorithms to Address Major Computational Challenges in Current Microbiome Research,9158909,R01AI125982,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Floods', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral Microbiology', 'Outcome', 'Periodontal Diseases', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'epidemiology study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'oral behavior', 'oral microbiome', 'research study', 'response', 'tumor progression', 'web app']",NIAID,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2016,311803,0.003904906057727039
"Mapping the synaptic connectivity and function of sensory neuronal circuits Experimental Progress  Zebrafish visual behaviors:  We are preparing a manuscript describing the combinatorial coding properties of neurons in the larval zebrafish optic tectum. The collection of large scale electron microscopy data from a functionally characterized tectum is underway.  Neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb:  We are preparing a manuscript describing the connectivity patterns between adult born neurons and projection neurons in the mouse olfactory bulb using a combination of optogenetic and electrophysiological approaches.  We are also preparing a manuscript describing a novel method to allow penetration of antibodies into thick tissue sections with minimal disruption to tissue ultrastructure. This method has been used to triple immunohistochemically label periglomerular cells in the mouse olfactory bulb. We completed the collection of a large electron microscopy of this tissue and are in the process of analyzing the dense connectivity patterns of periglomerular cells in olfactory bulb glomeruli.   EM analysis of retinal circuitry:  A collaboration with the labs of Dr. Rob Smith and Dr. Jeff Diamond led to a publication that appeared in Nature in 2016. In this study we identified a species-specific wiring difference in the direction-selective circuitry of mice and rabbits. This wiring pattern difference compensates for their substantially different  eye diameters and allows the two species to encode similar angular velocities in visual space.   Technical Progress  Development of custom serial-block face microtome:  An application was filed to license our serial block-face microtome and a licensing agreement is pending.  3D EM data analysis:  We have pursued two avenues to aid the automated analysis of 3D EM data. On the experimental side, we conducted a study examining the benefits of preserving the extracellular space during chemical tissue fixation that is normally lost. We have confirmed that the preservation of extracellular space improves the automated segmentation of 2D and 3D EM volumes. A manuscript describing this method was published in Elife in 2015.  On the data analysis side, we have scaled up our machine learning-based data analysis pipeline to be able to segment terabyte-scale datasets. We are currently using the pipeline to analyze the recently acquired mouse olfactory bulb dataset.   Web based Proofreading Tool:  Our web based EM segmentation proofreading tool is online and externally accessible. We added a tutorial to demonstrate how to use the site. We are using the tool to accumulate more training data for the neural networks. n/a",Mapping the synaptic connectivity and function of sensory neuronal circuits,9358603,ZIANS003133,"['Adult', 'Agreement', 'Antibodies', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biological Preservation', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diamond', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Extracellular Space', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microtome - medical device', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Online Systems', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Retinal', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Side', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Tectum Mesencephali', 'Thick', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neurogenesis', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'scale up', 'superior colliculus Corpora quadrigemina', 'terabyte', 'tool']",NINDS,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE,ZIA,2016,1569420,0.012873973721366968
"Large-scale Network Modeling for Brain Dynamics: Statistical Learning and Optimization Summary The human brain is a large, well-connected, and dynamic network. Using functional MRI data, modeling how this network processes the stimulus information has yielded insight on some of the mechanisms of the brain. However, the past efforts, including ours, on using small-scale models yielded limited understanding of how the complete and dynamic neural system functions in task-related experiments. Such understanding cannot be recovered from the data without substantial and collaborative efforts on model development. Towards this goal, we formed a collaborative team from modelers to end-users, and we will develop large-scale methods for task related fMRI (tfMRI), including event-related fMRI, to model whole-brain network dynamics responding to task challenges. Using modern statistical learning principals and large-scale optimization algorithms, we will develop novel methods to model nonlinear, spatial-temporal dependence in high dimensional data of fMRI, stimuli, and behavior outcomes. We will primarily base our methods in the regularized, constrained graphical model (GM) framework, a promising multivariate framework for inferring brain connectivity that has been validated by simulation and anatomical studies. Using this framework, we will develop novel methods to investigate, at a large scale, how changes in connectivity and activation are driven by task challenges and how multiple brain pathways process stimulus information. We will perform comprehensive validation and assessment of the newly developed methods, using both simulated and multiple tfMRI data from large cohorts. Using the scale of modeling that previous approaches cannot readily address without substantial time penalties and maybe also inaccuracies, our collaborative team will also use these methods to investigate various novel questions and hypotheses concerning the neural basis for cognitive control as one of the use cases. We will also develop publicly available, open source implementations for a broad range of use in the neuroimaging community. These modeling efforts will lead to new insights on the networks of large-scale neural circuits, and provide pharmacological targets that may be overlooked using small-scale models.     PUBLIC RELEVANCE STATEMENT We propose a foundational framework for modeling whole-brain network dynamics.

"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data.

"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",9100683,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'peer', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,680020,0.05162848092088944
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9170501,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2016,450322,0.06703371512947326
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,9097814,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Structures', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Internships', 'K-12 student', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'fluorescence imaging', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroinformatics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,323032,0.02936267877846752
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels.

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement.                 n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9052441,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,425468,0.008232510011142356
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.                ",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9030044,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,340627,0.030464036614547205
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8913771,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2015,330386,0.009789089987789882
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8795225,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'simulation', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,369756,0.0019166674920473238
"COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway5,10. However, there is a significant gap in existing strategies which focus on anonymized, post-hoc sharing of either 1) full raw or preprocessed data [in the case of open studies] or 2) manually computed summary measures [such as hippocampal volume11, in the case of closed (or not yet shared) studies] which we propose to address. Current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the dat as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions). This needs to change, so that the scientific community becomes a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see recent overview on this from our group2).    The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while also leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator; this motivates  dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. We are proposing a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). The system will provide an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data can be avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. To achieve this, in Aim 1, the uniform data interfaces that we propose will make it easy to share and cooperate. Robust and novel quality assurance and replicability tools will also be incorporated. Collaboration and data sharing will be done through forming temporary (need and project-based) virtual clusters of studies performing automatically generated local computation on their respective data and aggregating statistics in global inference procedures. The communal organization will provide a continuous stream of large scale projects that can be formed and completed without the need of creating new rigid organizations or project-oriented storage vaults. In Aim 2, we develop, evaluate, and incorporate privacy-preserving algorithms to ensure that the data used are not re-identifiable even with multiple re-uses. We also will develop advanced distributed and privacy preserving approaches for several key multivariate families of algorithms (general linear model, matrix factorization [e.g. independent component analysis], classification) to estimate intrinsic networks and perform data fusion. Finally, in Aim 3, we will demonstrate the utility of this approach in a proof of concept study through distributed analyses of substance abuse datasets across national and international venues with multiple imaging modalities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent to collect human neuroimaging data for clinical and research purposes, many of which don't have data sharing agreements or collect sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Opportunities for large scale aggregated analyses to infer health-relevant facts create new challenges in protecting the privacy of individuals' data. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a good solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we are proposing will capture this 'missing data' and allow for pooling of both open and 'closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of widely-used algorithms and incorporating within an easy-to-use platform which enables distributed computation. In addition, COINSTAC will accelerate research on both open and closed data by offering a distributed computational solution for a large toolkit of widely used algorithms.                ","COINSTAC: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",8975906,R01DA040487,"['AODD relapse', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Paper', 'Plant Roots', 'Poaceae', 'Population', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'distributed data', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'repository', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIDA,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2015,727692,0.05162848092088944
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics.

"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation. n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8920676,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,323033,0.02936267877846752
"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications. Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging. The goal of this project is to develop a new software platform for automated aggregation, synthesis, and sharing of published neuroimaging results, with the potential to advance understanding of mechanisms underlying mental health disorders.",Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data,8894083,R01MH096906,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'frontier', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'open source', 'psychologic', 'theories', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2015,547000,0.027485745286203702
"White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis In a project with investigators from the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, NICHD, and the Program on Pediatric Imaging and Tissue Sciences (PPITS), NICHD we use a theoretical framework to predict how the changes in myelin thickness, as well as the increase in the nodal width, affects the propagation of the signals along a myelinated axon. Both of these are regulated by the surrounding glial cells and dependent on the level of activity present in an axon. The theoretical predictions are implemented in Mathematica and are compared with the experimentally observed values, with the ultimate goal of addressing the role of myelinating glia in learning and plasticity. Manuscript describing a detailed experimental findings on the role of astrocytes in modifying the myelinated axon properties is submitted to Neuron.   We also study theoretical aspects of myelin plasticity and the consequences of such adaptive time delays. In particular, we studied the effect of adaptive time delays on the stability of the system of coupled oscillators, with implications to the stability of the oscillations and synchrony in the brain. In a manuscript published in Neuroscience, 2014, we showed how the impairment of activity-dependent myelination and the loss of adaptive time delays may contribute to disorders where hyper- and hypo-synchrony of neuronal firing leads to dysfunction (e.g., dyslexia, schizophrenia, epilepsy). This suggests that the myelin plasticity may be necessary to maintain normal oscillatory activity in the developing and adult brain. This work is also to be presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D.C., in November of 2014.  In a project with investigators of the Section on Critical Brain Dynamics in the Intramural Research Program at NIMH, we study weighted complex networks, in particular cortical and brain networks. Our study reveals novel and robust weight organization particularly pronounced in the networks with biological origin (neural, gene), but also in different social and language (word) networks. Additionally, using simulations, we show that such network architecture can be obtained using local learning rules that adjust the weights in the network based on the past interactions between the nodes. We conducted a detailed simulation study of this learning rule, which is reminiscent of temporal delay reinforcement learning. We show that such type of learning increases the accessibility of all paths on the network and allows such complex systems to overcome engrained structure/paths and allows it to adapt to new challenges. This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering.  We were also involved in two projects that relate to Statistical and Machine Learning, but not reported under the Statistical Learning for Biomedical project (with James Malley as LI). The first involved using machine learning and the large genetic and other data available publicly for the C. elegans worm to investigate to what degree the known neural connectivity of C. elegans can be estimated from the genetic, geometric and other information that is available on various public databases. We showed that even with a limited set of gene expression data that we gathered, accuracy of 86% percent can be achieved. We expect the accuracy to improve as more genetic data become available in the future. This work was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience, San Diego, in November of 2013. The second project involved using machine learning to estimate behavioral modes of mouse to be used with The System for Continuous Observation of Rodents in Home-cage Environment (SCORHE). This work was published in Behavior Research Methods in 2014.  A project with investigators from the Laboratory of Clinical and Developmental Genomics, NICHD we study neuronal cultures created by reprogramming skin cells from autistic patients as well as normals. It is a part of a larger study addressing the molecular and cellular changes that occur in the autistic brain during the development. In the current study the goal is to identify the changes in the network structure, or in the activity profile of different cells that distinguishes the normal cell cultures from those of autistic patients.  In a continuing project with investigators in the Program on Pediatric Imaging and Tissue Sciences (PPITS), NICHD we conduct a theoretical study of the observed skewed and heavy-tailed axon diameter distribution and arrive at a parametric form that optimizes the informative upper bound (IUB) as well as the information capacity of the nerve fascicles.  A manuscript describing this work is published in PLOS ONE in 2013. In a follow-up work, this distribution has been implemented and applied to simulated and experimental data, yielding improved measurements of the axon diameter distributions. n/a",White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis,8941409,ZIACT000275,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Caliber', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'District of Columbia', 'Dyslexia', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fascicle', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nerve', 'Network-based', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nodal', 'Normal Cell', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Weight', 'Width', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'meetings', 'myelination', 'nervous system development', 'network architecture', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'social', 'white matter']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIA,2014,200860,-0.004111760903804714
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8714056,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2014,330386,0.009789089987789882
"Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION: The objective of this proposal is to develop and theoretically evaluate a unified set of statistical, computational, and software tools to address data mining and discovery science challenges in the analysis of existing vast amounts of publicly available neuroimaging data. In particular, we propose to develop scalable and robust semiparametric solutions for high-throughput estimation of resting-state brain connectivity networks, both at the individual and population levels, with the flexibility of incorporating covariate information.  The work will contribute meaningfully to the theory and methods for large-scale semiparametric graphical models and will apply these methods to the largest collections of resting-state fMRI data available. The proposed methods and theory include key directions of research for brain network estimation and mining. First, we pro- pose novel methods for subject-specific network estimation, such as would be needed for biomarker development in functional brain imaging. Secondly, we define and propose to evaluate and implement methods for studying population-level graphs, which study collections of graphs. Thirdly, we propose the use of estimated graphs in predictive modeling. Finally, all of these methods will have complementary software and web services development. Most notably, the idea of population graphs allows for the creation of functional brain network atlases.  In summary, the work of this proposal will result in a unified framework for the analysis of modern neuroimaging data via graphical models. Our methods will further be agnostic to intricacies of the technology, thus making it portable across settings and applicable outside of the field of functional brain imaging. The methods will be carefully evaluated via theory, simulation and data-based application evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Modern neuroimaging data are often Big, Complex, Noisy and Dependent. We propose a systematic attempt on methodological development for the largely unexplored but practically important problem of network estimation and mining based on neuroimaging data. Our proposed work represents a significant step forward over the current methodology and has the potential to be applied to analyze a wide range of scientific problems beyond brain imaging data analysis.                ",Large-Scale Semiparametric Graphical Models with Applications to Neuroscience,8611397,R01MH102339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain research', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'theories', 'user friendly software', 'web services']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,378911,0.0019166674920473238
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics. Because current optogenetic tools are still limited in purpose our goal is to maximize the optogenetic toolkit by providing much-needed tools for the broad neuroscience community.                ",Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination,8684987,R21MH103824,"['Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chimera organism', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homologous Protein', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Infrared Rays', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Left', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Parents', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Potassium', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vent', 'Visible Radiation', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'desensitization', 'design', 'directed evolution', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'microbial', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2014,249750,0.03363447559843271
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8697162,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,333533,0.02936267877846752
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

Many contemporary neuroscience research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high-speed storage devices. A limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a readily accessible high-speed computational resource. A central computational resource based on a unified cluster of contemporary Linux CPUs and GPUs will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access common to stand-alone workstations. The requested computer cluster has system software that automatically balances CPU and GPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off-loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets. This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists. The system can be readily expansion as needs, either computational, storage, or new users, arise. Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost. The flexible nature of the system will serve a variety of research needs of the Brown brain science community. The computational resource is expected to bring together researchers at Brown working on the common problem of neural processing.             n/a",Brain Science Computer Cluster,8447697,S10OD016366,"['Architecture', 'Brain', 'Client', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Linux', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'base', 'computer cluster', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'design', 'flexibility', 'novel', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software systems']",OD,BROWN UNIVERSITY,S10,2013,599598,-0.0024279348208525887
"Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subcellular distribution of synapses is critical for the assembly, function, and plasticity of the nervous system and plays a role in its disorders. Underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain largely unknown. While advanced multidimensional images, in conjunction with single-cell genetic techniques, have afforded an unprecedented opportunity to understand synapse development at a new level, there is a knowledge gap in our capacity to effectively quantify subcellular synapses from large quantities of three-dimensional images. This is a significant problem and has hampered large-scale studies of the molecular mechanisms of synapse development, especially in neurons with complex arbor-such as Purkinje cells in mammals and lobula plate tangential cells (LPTC) in Drosophila-where existing approaches do not yield complete or robust synapse quantification for the entire dendritic tree and do not scale to efficient genetic screening. The objective of thi project is to bridge this gap by providing tools for quantitative investigation of subcellular synapse distribution and its molecular mechanisms using three-dimensional microscopy images. Specifically, our highly cross- disciplinary team will pursue two aims: (1) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Holistic and objective description of synapse density will enable automatic detection of mutant patterns. (2) Develop automatic algorithms to analyze and quantify synapse distribution in different parts of the entire dendritic tree of neurons with complex arbor. Efficient quantification at distinct subcellular locations will assist discovery of novel regulators for different subcellular parts. As a test case, we will use synapse distribution n Drosophila LPTC neurons, which are amenable to both genome-wide genetic screens and genetic manipulations with single-neuron resolution. We will develop reliable methods to characterize the density of inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory cholinergic synapses from three-dimensional fluorescence confocal images. Our algorithms will lead to the next level of mechanistic understanding that controls the subcellular distribution of inhibitory and excitatory synapses, and enable a wide range of quantitative analyses for other types of neurons with similar complexity. Powerful multichannel co-analysis and machine learning approaches will be used to improve synapse detection and subcellular compartment extraction for overcoming challenges in 3D confocal image, including staining artifacts and anisotropic resolution. Algorithms will be developed using a model-guided methodology that emphasizes efficiency for large volume 3D images during genetic screening. Pattern-recognition methods will be used to speed up proofreading of the synapse quantification results. A novel ordering strategy will be adapted for neurons of complex dendritic arbor to quantify subcellular synapses in a functionally meaningful way. The project will produce a set of open-source, extensible tools for automatic synapse quantification and proofreading, with friendly graphical-user interfaces, to serve the neuroscience community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying molecular mechanisms for the subcellular distribution of synapses remain largely unknown, which hinders the discovery of novel therapies for many neurological disorders. By developing new, efficient automatic algorithms and open-source tools for quantifying synapses in neurons, this research intends to advance the capacity to effectively analyze large quantities of three-dimensional neuronal images, especially those of complex dendritic arbor. The work will impact public health by enabling a better understanding of disease mechanisms, which is the critical first step toward new treatments, and supports NIH's goal to advance understanding of fundamental biology to uncover the causes of specific diseases.            ",Automatic 3D Quantification of Synapse Distribution in Complex Dendritic Arbor,8574710,R15MH099569,"['Academic Research Enhancement Awards', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fluorescence', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic synapse', 'density', 'falls', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY,R15,2013,461165,0.006050235773987612
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).  Narrative Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject. Our collaborators who form the early adopters of this approach are neuroendocrinology researchers studying the mechanisms of stress and anxiety disorders which are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health care costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America). A better understanding of the neuronal mechanisms underlying these disorders could lead to new, effective therapies and treatments.",Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases,8426190,R01MH079068,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atlases', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Fluoro-Gold', 'Harvest', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'indexing', 'journal article', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'open source', 'prototype', 'research study', 'stress disorder', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2013,315672,0.024636179713086646
"CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Dendritic arbor shape and functional properties emerge from the interaction of many complex developmental processes. It is now accepted that multiple local-level interactions of cytoskeleton elements direct the growth and development of the dendrite arbor. However, the specific mechanisms that control developmental acquisition of final functional dendritic properties are largely unknown. Addressing this fundamental question requires novel data driven systems-biology tools to study developmental and biophysical mechanisms in the same neuronal model. A tightly-knit collaboration between molecular genetics, quantitative morphometry, and mathematical simulation can for the first time enable large-scale studies capable of achieving holistic understanding of the mechanisms underlying emergent features of the arbor. Project Goals: The main neuroscientific goal of this project is to understand how multiple local interactions of cytoskeleton components during differentiation define mature dendritic arbor shape and its functional integrative properties, using Drosophila sensory neurons as a model. The technological goal of this project is to develop a novel investigative approach that integrates and extends previously separate approaches from developmental biology & genetics, in vivo confocal imaging & electrophysiology, computer vision, and neuroanatomical modeling. Specific Aims: We propose 3 tightly integrated specific aims. Aim 1: use genetic manipulations and electrophysiological recordings to model the role of cytoskeletal organization and dynamics as a fundamental determinant of emergent dendrite arbor shape and function. Aim 2: Implement advanced 4D multi-parameter imaging protocols and automated algorithms to reconstruct the arbor, and quantify spatial and temporal associations among multiple sub-cellular components. Aim 3: using automated reconstructions & measurements from aim 2, statistically characterize the structural and cytoskeletal features of dendrite arbors, and stochastically simulate the growth and electrotonic properties of anatomically realistic virtual neuronal analogues. The data from aim 3 will feed back novel hypotheses to be tested by a subsequent repetition of the (aim 1 - aim 2 - aim 3) cycle. Approach: We will focus on a single model system - Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons. More specifically, we will investigate class I and class IV da neuron arborization based upon their radically distinct dendritic morphologies (simple vs. complex) and underlying cytoskeletal organizations. We will make fusion constructs of cytoskeleton components with spectrally distinct fluorescent proteins. These will be used in transgenic Drosophila in order to quantitatively measure the distribution of F-actin, microtubules, and microtubule polarity within the dendrite arbor throughout its development in vivo using confocal multi-fluor imaging. The resulting images will be processed by automated quantitative computer vision algorithms that will accurately extract the topology of the dendritic arbor, and it changes over time. We will use the resulting maps in neuroanatomical stochastic simulations to establish the links between the emergent morphometrics of the dendrite and specific cytoskeleton features at various developmental stages. Intellectual Merit: From a neurogenetics perspective, this project will pioneer the use of cytoskeletal features as putative fundamental determinants in statistical neuroanatomical models. These determinants will be linked to morphological determinants. From a computational perspective, this project will advance the state of the art in automated algorithms for delineating neuroanatomy (and its morphological dynamics) by deploying core technologies for large-scale multi-parameter studies, and result in an effective interfacing of automated reconstruction and simulation technologies. With this innovation, model predictions can be tested by molecular biological techniques, and findings of statistical models can be used to inform molecular models of dendrite arbor development. Educational Impact: This project will result in a cross-disciplinary training of post-doctoral fellows, graduate students, undergraduate students and high school interns. It will result in practical insight on ways to conduct cutting-edge systems-level scientific research overcoming disciplinary boundaries and using best-available collaborative tools. The trainees from this program will be uniquely positioned to develop the broader field of imaging-driven integrative systems neurobiology. It will expose minority and K-12 students to a new world of trans-disciplinary research that is indicative of the future. Broader Impacts: The combined body of molecular, imaging, and computational tools and datasets from this research will be disseminated widely, and made available to a broad class of investigators for adoption in the study of other major neuroscience problems. This project will serve as a new model for computationally enabled neuroscience research that achieves a long-desired synergy between the wet lab and computation.             n/a",CRCNS: Cytoskeletal Mechanisms of Dendrite Arbor Shape Development,8644396,R01NS086082,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Process', 'Discipline', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'F-Actin', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microtubules', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Models', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Trees', 'analog', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'data sharing', 'developmental genetics', 'developmental neurobiology', 'digital', 'feeding', 'genetic manipulation', 'graduate student', 'high school', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular modeling', 'morphometry', 'neurogenetics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'simulation', 'tool', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NINDS,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,322109,0.02936267877846752
"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.          Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases  Abstract The adage: 'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study. Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science. This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system. This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale). These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles). A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available. This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner. We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure. As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature. We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register. The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).

"Scalable Assays for Morphological Analysis of Mammalian Neurons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medium and high-throughput assays (i.e., screens) have generally not been applied to mammalian neurons because of the difficulties in culturing them in large numbers and because of the low efficiency with which the genetic makeup of neurons can be altered. Furthermore, because many aspects of neuronal function can only be assayed with electrophysiological assays, follow-up analysis and validation of screening hits is difficult. We propose to use automated imaging approaches to analyze synapse number and neuronal structure in vitro in a scalable format. We have implemented tissue culture and immunostaining approaches to monitor the number and types of synapses formed onto neurons in multi-well plates. We will couple this analysis with lentivirus mediated introduction of short-hairpin RNAs to induce RNA interference against genes expressed in neurons. This will be performed in concert with transcriptional analysis of neurons to determine the key changes in gene expression that correlate with structural and synaptic changes. The proposal represents a significant collaboration between several groups with expertise in functional analysis of neurons, automated analysis of images, viral mediated manipulation of gene expression, and whole-genome transcriptional analysis. We hope that our work will lead, for the first time, to a turn-key and robust method of analysis of neuron and synapse structure suitable for scalable, whole-genome analysis. Such a system will permit the unbiased and systematic analysis of pathways involved in neuropsychiatric diseases including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's as well as neurodevelopmental disorders such as mental retardation and autism.        Massively parallel analysis of cells in many conditions has allowed the discovery of key pathways that control cell function. Unfortunately, these techniques have not been applied to neurons due to difficulties in handling, manipulating, and analyzing large numbers of brain cells. We propose to develop imaging-based techniques to analyze neurons in dishes at a high throughput in order to find pathways that control their development and susceptibility to disease.

"Large-scale Automated Synthesis of Functional Neuroimaging Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosive growth of the human neuroimaging literature has led to major advances in understanding of normal and abnormal human brain function, but has also made aggregation and synthesis of neuroimaging findings increasingly difficult. The goal of this project is to develop an automated software platform for large-scale synthesis of human functional neuroimaging studies. Our work builds directly on an existing software platform (NeuroSynth) and involves key extensions and improvements that focus on (i) aggregation, (ii) coding, (iii) synthesis, and (iv) sharing of functional neuroimaging data. In Aim 1, we will use computational linguistics and bioinformatics data mining techniques to develop new algorithms for automatically extracting activation foci and associated metadata from published neuroimaging articles. In Aim 2, we will use topic-modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Analysis in combination with existing cognitive ontologies such as the Cognitive Atlas to develop structured representations of automatically extracted neuroimaging data. In Aim 3, we will improve the meta-analysis and classification capacities of our existing platform by implementing a state-of- the-art hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis method recently developed by the research team. Finally, in Aim 4, we will develop a state-of-the-art web interface (://neurosynth.org) that supports real-time, in-browser access to the data, results, and tools produced in Aims 1 - 3. Realizing these objectives will introduce powerful new tools for organizing and synthesizing the neuroimaging literature on an unprecedented scale. These tools will be freely and publicly available to anyone with an internet connection, enabling rapid and efficient application to a broad range of clinical and basic research applications.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functional neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI have opened a new frontier in efforts to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms of normal and abnormal cognition. However, the rapidly expanding scope of the literature makes distillation and synthesis of brain imaging findings increasingly challenging.

"Enhancing 3dsvm to improve its interoperability and dissemination    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research plan outlines crucial software enhancements to a program called 3dsvm, which is a command line program and graphical user interface (gui) plugin for AFNI (Cox, 1996). 3dsvm performs support vector machine (SVM) analysis on fMRI data, which constitutes one important approach to performing multivariate supervised learning of neuroimaging data. 3dsvm originally provided the ability to analyze fMRI data as described in (LaConte et al., 2005). Since its first distribution as a part of AFNI, it has been steadily extended to provide new functionality including regression and non-linear kernels, as well as multiclass classification capabilities. In addition to its integration into AFNI, features that make 3dsvm particularly well suited for fMRI analysis are that it is easy to spatially mask voxels (to include/exclude them in the SVM analysis) as well as to flexibly select subsets of a dataset to use as training or testing samples. It has been used to generate results for our own work and for collaborative efforts and has been cited as a resource by others (Mur et al. 2009; Hanke et al. 2009). Despite many positive aspects of 3dsvm, the priorities of PAR-07-417 address a genuine need that this software project has - the ability to focus on improvements that will increase its dissemination and interoperability. A major motivation for PAR-07-417 is to facilitate the improved interface, characterization, and documentation to enhance the extent of sharing and to provide the groundwork for future extensions. Our aims are well aligned with this program announcement. Further, there is a growing need in the neuroimaging community for tools such as 3dsvm. Since 3dsvm is not a new project, is tightly integrated into the software environment of AFNI, and can be further integrated to enable better functionality to support needs as diverse as NIfTI format capabilities to rtFMRI, this proposed project will help to further the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research by supporting its need for wide-spread adoption of high-quality neuroimaging tools.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal focuses on improving, characterizing, and documenting an existing neuroinformatics software tool.

"Informatics Infrastructure for vector-based neuroanatomical atlases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The adage:  'all data is spatial' is especially pertinent in the field of neuroscience, since neuronal data must be indexed by the neuroanatomical location of phenomena or entities under study.  Brain atlases are very widely used as laboratory tools, being some of the most highly cited publications in science.  This proposal seeks to use brain atlases as a method for indexing data from the literature in a neuroinformatics system.  This data includes both textual and graphical information, ranging from highly detailed maps constructed from vector- based spatial primitives, histological photographs and drawings, to textual reports of experimental findings in the literature (which we will analyze on a large scale).  These data represent a significant scientific investment that are currently locked away in previously published journal articles (and the detailed data-sets and drawings from researchers that were used to write the articles).  A prototype that summarizes the last fifteen years' output of one of the world's most prominent neuroanatomy laboratories is immediately available.  This project will develop a collaborative environment to enable neuroscientists to use these valuable maps within the community as a whole by contributing data to a shared system with an open-source system (called 'NeuARt II') that permits querying, overlaying, viewing and annotating such data in an integrated manner.  We will also use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to index neuroanatomical references in large numbers of journal articles to be accessible within our infrastructure.  As an initial text corpus, we over 110,000 documents taken from last 35 years of published information from the primary neuroanatomical literature.  We will construct a neuroanatomical interface that conceptually resembles the 'Google Maps' system, permitting users to use an intuitive spatial interface to browse large amounts of biomedical data in spatial register.  The proposed infrastructure will also provide new opportunities to compare and synthesize the anatomical components of neuroscience data multiple modalities (physiological, behavioral, clinical, genetic, molecular, etc.).PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Given the scope of the use of neuroanatomical maps from the rat and mouse in the study of neurobiological disease, we expect our research impact scientists working in almost all subfields of the subject.

"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia.

"Generation and Description of Dendritic Morphology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This continuing project is directed at describing dendrite structure in a compact yet sufficiently complete and detailed fashion to allow the computer generation of morphologically accurate neuronal models.

"Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sharing data between research centers is increasingly important for contemporary brain imaging studies because they involve large numbers of subjects and complex analysis protocols that require highly specialized expertise. Our long-term objective is to facilitate brain-imaging research by enabling remote researchers to pool data between institutions and to analyze data using the appropriate algorithms executing on distributed resources. There are a number of difficult data management and technology challenges that have limited the success of data sharing environments. Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data. Building upon years of providing brain-mapping expertise to collaborators, we propose to solve problems that we repeatedly encounter and that currently limit progress in brain imaging research. We propose to develop validated tools that enable collaborators to remotely access a variety of data analysis methods and databases. We will create web-based tools to perform multi-institutional studies, and provide access to complex data processing protocols executing on distributed computing resources. There are three specific aims. 1) Enable the web based acquisition and management of data utilizing an access control system that includes consideration of subject consent limits and investigator imposed conditions to facilitate data pooling for multi-institutional studies. This system will convert data files between different formats and schemas so that data can be used consistently between analysis programs and databases. It will also anonymize images and metadata according to institution-specific protocols. 2) Develop a system that is aware of data type and provenance so that it may act intelligently to arbitrate between different analysis programs. This system will capture the expertise of experienced lab personnel in the usage of various tools and assist new users in designing appropriate analytic strategies. 3) Create meta-algorithms that improve the robustness of techniques for neuroimaging analysis by intelligently combining the results from multiple algorithms. The proposed approach will provide a set of tools that address significant problems in data sharing and utilization.

"NEW DRUG TARGETS FOR APOPTOSIS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to establish an Integrated Neuroinformatics Resource on Alcoholism (INRA) as the informatics core component of the Integrative Neuroscience Initiative on Alcoholism Consortium (INIA). The overall goal of the INRA will be to create an integrated, multiresolution repository of neuroscience data, ranging from molecules to behavior for collaborative research on alcoholism. As the neuroinformatics core of the INIAC, the INRA will enable the integration of all data generated by all components of the INIAC. Furthermore, it will support synthesis of new knowledge through computational neurobiology tools for exploratory analysis including visualization, data mining and simulation. The INRA will represent a synthesis of emerging approaches in bioinformatics and existing methods of neuroinformatics to provide the INIAC a versatile toolbox of computational methods for elucidating the effects of alcohol on the nervous system. The specific aims of the INRA will be: (i) implementation of an informatics infrastructure for integrating complex neuroscience data, from molecules to behavior, generated by the consortium and relevant data available in the public domain; (ii) development of an integrated secure web-based environment so that consortium members can interactively visualize, search and update the integrated neuroscience knowledge; and (iii) development of data mining tools, including biomolecular sequence analysis, gene expression array analysis, characterization of Biochemical pathways, and natural language processing to support hypothesis generation and testing regarding ethanol Consumption and neuroadaptation to alcohol. We will also collaborate with related neuroscience projects to utilize existing resources for brain atlases, neuronal circuits and neuronal properties. The INRA will The made available to the INIAC through a Neb-based system through interactive graphical user interfaces that will seamlessly integrate tools for data entry, modification, search, retrieval and mining. The core of the INRA will be based on robust knowledge management methods and tools that will Effectively integrate disparate forms of neuroscience data and make it amenable to complex inferences. Our proposed strategy ensures that the informatics resource is: (i) flexible and scalable to address the evolving needs of the INIAC, and (ii) highly intuitive and user-friendly to ensure optimal utilization by the INIAC members. The proposed INRA is a novel system for Collaborative research in neuroscience and alcoholism which will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of experts in Bioinformatics, computational biology, neuroscience and alcoholism research. We believe the INRA will greatly enhance the Dace of discovery in the area of ethanol consumption and neuroadaptation to alcohol within the INIAC as well as the general research community. n/a",NEW DRUG TARGETS FOR APOPTOSIS,7284550,P01CA017094,"['antineoplastics', 'biomedical facility', 'chemosensitizing agent', 'clinical research', 'drug design /synthesis /production', 'drug resistance', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,P01,2006,498959,0.03890997764644178

Rather than attempt to develop a comprehensive and general solution, we propose to develop a set of open, interoperable, and portable software tools that address critical issues currently limiting efforts to share and analyze brain-imaging data. Building upon years of providing brain-mapping expertise to collaborators, we propose to solve problems that we repeatedly encounter and that currently limit progress in brain imaging research. We propose to develop validated tools that enable collaborators to remotely access a variety of data analysis methods and databases. We will create web-based tools to perform multi-institutional studies, and provide access to complex data processing protocols executing on distributed computing resources. There are three specific aims. 1) Enable the web based acquisition and management of data utilizing an access control system that includes consideration of subject consent limits and investigator imposed conditions to facilitate data pooling for multi-institutional studies. This system will convert data files between different formats and schemas so that data can be used consistently between analysis programs and databases. It will also anonymize images and metadata according to institution-specific protocols. 2) Develop a system that is aware of data type and provenance so that it may act intelligently to arbitrate between different analysis programs. This system will capture the expertise of experienced lab personnel in the usage of various tools and assist new users in designing appropriate analytic strategies. 3) Create meta-algorithms that improve the robustness of techniques for neuroimaging analysis by intelligently combining the results from multiple algorithms. The proposed approach will provide a set of tools that address significant problems in data sharing and utilization. The resulting information technology will be scalable and applicable to other scientific data sharing problems.         n/a",Collaborative Brain Mapping: Tools for Sharing,6953037,R01MH071940,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'confidentiality', 'data management', 'information dissemination', 'information systems', 'mathematics']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2005,647432,8.452687254065928e-05

"NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES The PI is a Neurophysiologist and Pediatric Neurosurgeon who will be the         Associate Director of Center V (Behavioral and Neurobiology Research), with      special responsibility for Neurobiology programs, at the Children""s              Research Institute.  This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6391354,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2001,99063,0.05376020272923243
"PARALLEL SIMULATION OF LARGE SCALE NEURONAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  Over the last decade             computational modeling has become central to neurobiology.  While much of        this work has focused on cellular and sub-cellular processes, the last few       years have seen increasing interest in systems level models and in               integrative accounts that span data from the subcellular to behavioral           levels.  Our proposal, in summary, is to extend existing work in parallel        discrete event simulation (PDES) and integrate it with existing work on          compartmental modeling environments, to produce a software environment which     has comprehensive support for modeling large scale, highly structured            networks of biophysically realistic cells; and which can efficiently exploit     the full range of parallel platforms, including the largest parallel             supercomputers, for simulation of these network models, which integrate          information about the nervous system from sub-cellular to the whole-brain        level.  Because of the scale of the models needed at this level of               integration, advanced parallel computing is required.  The critical              technical insight upon which this work rests is that neuronal modeling at        the systems level can often be reduced to a form of discrete event               simulation in which single cells are node functions and voltage spikes are       events.

The software development aims include 1)                investigation of a portable, PDES system capable of running efficiently on       diverse parallel platforms, 2) development of interfaces to the PDES for         NEURON and GENESIS allowing models developed in those packages to be scaled      up, 3) investigation of a network specification language for neuronal            models, and associated a visualization interface, to facilitate                  investigation of systems-level models, 4) sufficiently robust and                well-documented software for download and installation at other sites.

This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6185560,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2000,99063,0.05376020272923243

"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,6000000,0.0005098377797777766

They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,350546,0.0005098377797777766
"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation. SCAN will establish an intellectual home for dissemination of cutting-edge research in human cognitive auditory neuroscience, support the development of the next generation of scientists, build a vibrant and inclusive community that engages with the grand challenges in the field, and forge new academia-industry partnerships.",SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN),9914387,R13DC018243,"['Academia', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Atmosphere', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Joint Ventures', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Otolaryngology', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'deafness', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open data', 'posters', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'symposium', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,36183,-0.020158031489567727
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10058463,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,627034,0.03648220006681244
"Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience Two major recent advances have raised the possibility of fundamental breakthroughs in both basic and clinical neuroscience: the development of new tools to probe the nervous system with single-cell resolution as well as brain-wide scope, and breakthroughs in machine learning methods for handling complex data. Yet there remain crucial barriers to progress: while data acquisition tools are now broadly within the grasp of neuroscience researchers, the same cannot be said about data analytical tools that can tackle the complexities of the new data sets being gathered. In addition, the highly training-data dependent, black-box Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods that have shown rapid growth in the technological domain, are not well-suited to scientific data analysis, where transparency and understanding is more important than black-box performance measures. This proposal brings together a cross-disciplinary team of leading neuroscience and computer science researchers to develop and deploy a critical set of data analytical tools for the neuroscience community. The tools will be useful for data already gathered in major group efforts in the US Brain Initiative, and also for new data sets being acquired using the tools developed in the Initiative.  Extraction of the projection morphologies of individual neurons, and the classification and analysis of neuronal cell types is a central goal of the Brain Initiative. Because data from various sources are often analyzed with custom algorithms, scaling up existing approaches for use across large datasets and multiple data types has been a challenge. Instead researchers need a comprehensive, flexible mathematical framework that can be applied to a wide variety of data, including both static and dynamic measures. We propose to achieve this goal by combining Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods with Deep Net based machine learning methods. Such a combined approach retains the flexibility of data-driven ANN methods while at the same time brings in conceptually well-grounded methods from TDA that are still able to address the complexities of brain-wide data sets with single-cell resolution. Aim 1 of the proposal will use these methods to automate tasks in neuroanatomy previously requiring intensive human expert effort. Aim 2 will apply the methods to single cell omics data sets. Aim 3 will deploy the tools developed to the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network and the neuroscience community. Recent years have seen many advances in experimental tools for probing brains in unprecedented ways, with single cell resolution, and as a result both individual investigators and large consortia are generating brain-wide single-cell data at an unprecedented scale. To derive full benefit from these data sets, researchers need theoretical and computational tools to analyze, visualize and derive knowledge from the data. In the proposed work, theoretically principled tools from Topological Data Analysis, in particular Discrete Morse Theory, are combined with artificial neural networks for Machine Learning, to provide a computational and analytical framework to deal with the complexity of the large-scale, high-dimensional data sets and derive the full benefits for basic as well as clinical neuroscience research.",Combined Topological and Machine Learning Tools for Neuroscience,10123310,RF1MH125317,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Performance', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Skeleton', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'data centers', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'high dimensionality', 'informatics tool', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data types', 'neuronal cell body', 'rapid growth', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,RF1,2020,2048230,0.012613167254491431
"Data Science and Sharing Team For our fourth annual report we have provided some highlights of our team's activities over the past fiscal year.  COVID-19  We are working to help respond to the pandemic crisis by supporting scientists working on datasets related to the virus including Drs. Francisco Pereira, Joyce Chung, and Melissa Brotman. This work is in its early stages.  Data Sharing  Our team continues to collaborate with Joyce Chung and the NIMH Clinical Director's Office on the Healthy Research Volunteers Protocol (NCT03304665). As of this writing, behavioral and phenotypic data for 270 participants have been deposited into the NIMH Data Archive (NDA, https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=2843). These data will be publicly accessible in the next NDA data release, scheduled for 11/15/2020. Of this larger pool of participants, 147 have been scanned using a standardized MRI protocol that was designed in collaboration with Vinai Roopchansingh from the NIMH fMRI Core Facility. 66 of these scans are already available for download from the NDA.  Our group also collaborated with Stefano Marenco and Barbara Lipska in the Human Brain Collection Core for a deposit of genomics data from post-mortem brains of individuals with psychiatric disorders. This DNA methylation data was generated by Gabriel Fries and comes from the hippocampus of 32 Bipolar Disorder patients and 32 non-psychiatric controls. These data are also available from the NDA: (https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3151, experiment 1545).  Finally, we deposited to OpenNeuro (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002076) a dataset of high-resolution fMRI scans from Emily Finn. These data were acquired using a novel technique that allows investigation of varying patterns of brain response by cortical depth.  Data Curation  With the continued growth of large public datasets, data curation continues to be our teams most requested service. In 2019 we requested and hired a dedicated data curator, Arshitha Basavaraj, to help address these growing demands. Thanks to Arshitha's efforts, we are now curating over 100,000 MRI-based scan sessions across 28 different shared datasets. A list of these datasets is linked from our homepage (http://cmn.nimh.nih.gov/dsst). In order to make it easier to store and work with these large datasets, in the coming year we will expand our local disk storage as well as our disk space on the share computing cluster by one petabyte each. The scratch space will be made available to other NIMH users conducting large scale analyses.  Training  Training intramural investigators on the practices and tools to make science more reproducible remains one of our team's key goals. This year we were approached by Armin Raznahan's group to design and teach a set of tutorials on code version control and tools for online code collaboration and preservation (i.e. git and github). We delivered 16 hours of instruction for Dr. Raznahan's entire lab which has resulted in their group adopting new tools and strategies toward their analysis code.  Preregistered Replication  Starting in September of 2019, our team mentored a one-year post baccalaureate student, Nik Goyal, who submitted a paper to the Royal Society of Open Science on their preregistered replication track. In this publication model, only the study design and methods are peer reviewed before acceptance. If the design and methods are sound, the publication of the study is ensured regardless of the results. This model combats publication bias by ensuring that negative results are published. Nik's submission, which will apply a high-profile analysis to a novel dataset, was enthusiastically accepted by three independent reviewers and will be published soon. See Nik's bioRxiv submission for further details: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.23.058313  Incentivizing and Measuring Data Sharing  The NIMH has worked to incentivize data sharing in the science it funds for many years, but there is currently no way of measuring what percentage of papers have shared their data or how that percentage has changed over time. This project, led by Travis Riddle, is working toward building a tool that uses language processing, machine learning, and bibliometric techniques to analyze the text of published papers to identify and quantify data sharing practices. This work was recently presented at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping Meeting: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3894807  Collaborations  The DSST continues to collaborate with investigators on projects and publications that involve large shared datasets. In the past year, these collaborations have included multiple projects with our sister group, the Machine Learning Team (MLT). As applying machine learning methods to answer neuroscientific questions has become more prevalent, we seek to improve interpretability when applying deep neural networks to predict brain state. See our preprint for more information: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11114. In another project with the MLT, we aim to leverage information across multiple large datasets to improve upon individual phenotypic prediction models utilizing multiple imaging modalities.   In our collaboration with fellow IRP researcher Arman Raznahan and the Section on Developmental Neurogenomics, we assisted with processing the structural brain images from almost 40,000 subjects within the UK BioBank dataset in order to examine how variations in the X-chromosome relates to neuroanatomical variability. This work is under review.  Finally, in our collaboration with Danielle Bassett and Max Bertolero from the University of Pennsylvania, we are utilizing large, publicly available datasets to apply machine learning methods for individual prediction. This collaboration has resulted in two projects thus far: predicting behavioral phenotype from functional brain network connections and examining the complex relationship between genotype, functional brain networks, and behavioral phenotype.   Community Tools  Improving scientific reproducibility relies critically on freely available open source tools. Our team works to create and contribute to those tools whenever possible. Some of our recent contributions include:  - Documentation for the BIDS specification  The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification has quickly become a linchpin in reproducible neuroimaging pipelines. Providing easily accessible documentation for this rapidly evolving specification has proved challenging for the community. Arshitha Basavaraj resolved a long-standing issue of rewriting a pipeline to render the BIDS documentation into a clean PDF document. Her efforts were greeted with applause from the community https://twitter.com/arshitha94/status/1250942967143006208  - High Performance Computing Tools  High Performance Computing (HPC) is essential for working with large datasets, but users often find the tools difficult to learn and use. Dustin Moraczewski has written a small suite of tools to assist with several confusing tasks on the NIH HPC including running the BIDS validator, archiving data to object storage and setup and maintain interactive workspaces. These tools are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/dmoracze/HPC_helper_tools  - Bibliometric Tool (iCiteR)  The NIH Office of Portfolio Analysis recently developed and released iCite - a tool for obtaining bibliometric data for papers in PubMed. To facilitate access to these data by analysts, Travis Riddle wrote an R package that accesses and parses the data from iCite into a standardized format for further analysis.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,0.028999822157134456
"Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers There is an increasing need for efficient and robust software to process, integrate, and offer insight across the diversity of population imaging efforts underway across the BRAIN Initiative and other projects. Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges.

Advances in statistical learning offer a set of technologies that can address many research applications using the extensive and varied data being produced by the projects. This can transform how we analyze and integrate new data. We propose using Nobrainer, an open source Python library that leverages these new learning technologies, as a platform that greatly simplifies integrating deep learning into neuroimaging research. Using this library, we are building and distributing user-friendly and cloud enabled end-user applications for the neuroimaging community. In Aim 1, we provide neural network models. We will create robust, pre-trained neural networks for brain segmentation and time series processing using brain scans from over 65000 individuals. Once trained, these models can then be used as the basis for many other applications, especially in reducing time of processing. We will subsequently use these base networks to perform image processing, image correction, and quality control. In Aim 2, we address the ability to train on private datasets. We will use Bayesian neural network models, which support principled use of prior information. We will use these networks to help detect when the models are expected to fail on an input, and provide visualizations to better understand how the model is working. In Aim 3, we focus on the engineering needed to maintain the software infrastructure, improve efficiency, and increase the scalability of our training methods. Here, we will extend, maintain, and disseminate Nobrainer, our open source software framework, together with training materials and ready to use, cloud-friendly, applications. We will also create much faster, neural network equivalents of time consuming image processing tasks (e.g., registration, segmentation, and annotation). The Nobrainer tools developed through these aims will allow users to find and apply the most pertinent applications and developers to extend the framework to support new architectures and disseminate new models and applications. We expect these tools to be used by any neuroimaging researcher through integration with BRAIN archives and popular software packages. These tools will significantly reduce data processing and new model development time, thus allowing faster exploration of hypotheses using public data and increase reusability of data through greater trust in model outputs. 9/11/2019 ResearchPlan - Google Docs The proposal will create artificial intelligence software for scientists to analyze, integrate, and visualize data from large brain imaging projects, which inform our understanding of brain structure, function, and development. Open and reusable software helps to increase collaboration and benefits researchers, but can also be used by citizen scientists and students in high schools and colleges. An open collection of neural network tools will facilitate scientific communities and has the potential to accelerate scientific discoveries about the nervous system. https://docs.google.com/document/d/11s9ZRzy8tHs6NguzpnJdJUWRgLvdkXpEYjZchtJXSmY/edit# 2/23",Nobrainer: A robust and validated neural network tool suite for imagers,10021957,RF1MH121885,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Libraries', 'Longevity', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Pythons', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cognitive development', 'college', 'computerized data processing', 'connectome', 'data reuse', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'diverse data', 'high school', 'image processing', 'imager', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'software infrastructure', 'statistical learning', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2020,2000000,0.005239376979922842
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex.

"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Investigation', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain volume', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'interest', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'postsynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'synaptic function', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,0.0014603660674770865
"C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative ABSTRACT The BRAIN Initiative is designed to leverage sophisticated neuromodulation, electrophysiological recording, and macroscale neuroimaging techniques in human and non-human animal models in order to develop a multilevel understanding of human brain function. However, the necessary tools for organizing, processing and analyzing neuroimaging data generated through these efforts are not widely available as coherent and easy-to- use software packages. Gaps are particularly apparent for nonhuman data (i.e., monkey, rodent), as most of the existing processing and analytic software packages are specifically designed for human imaging. Methods have been proposed for addressing the challenges inherent to the processing of nonhuman data (e.g., brain extraction, tissue segmentation, spatial normalization, brain parcellation, temporal denoising); to date, these have not been readily integrated into an easy-to-use, robust, and reproducible analysis package. Similarly, many of the sophisticated machine learning and modeling methods developed for neuroimaging analyses are inaccessible to most researchers because they have not been integrated into easy-to-use pipeline software. As a result, translational and comparative neuroimaging researchers patch together neuroinformatics pipelines that use various combinations of disparate software packages and in-house code. We propose to extend the Configurable Pipeline for the Analysis of Connectomes (C-PAC) open-source software to provide robust and reproducible pipelines for functional and structural MRI data. We will integrate the various disparate image processing and analysis methods used to handle the challenges of nonhuman imaging data, into a single, open source, configurable, easy-to-use end-to-end analysis pipeline package that is accessible locally or via the cloud. The end product will not only improve the quality, transparency and reproducibility of nonhuman translational and comparative imaging, but also enable new avenues of scientific inquiry through our inclusion of methods that are yet to be applied to nonhuman imaging data (e.g., gradient- based cortical parcellation methods, hyperalignment). Specific aims of the proposed work include to: 1) Integrate neuroimaging processing and analysis methods optimized for BRAIN Initiative data, 2) Implement strategies for carrying out comparative studies of human and non-human populations, and 3) Extend C-PAC to include cutting-edge analytical strategies for identifying mechanisms of brain function. All development will occur “in the open” using GitHub and other collaborative tools to maximally involve participation in the C-PAC project. Annual hackathons will be held to collaborate with investigators from BRAIN Initiative awards and other neuroinformatics development projects to integrate their tools with C-PAC. Hands-on training will be held to train investigators on optimal use of the newly developed tools. NARRATIVE New neuroimaging analysis software is needed to process and analyze the various human and non-human neuroimaging data collected through the BRAIN Initiative. We will address this need by extending the already mature C-PAC human brain imaging data analysis pipeline to include support for animal data, with a particular focus on providing methods for conducting comparative studies between species. The proposed work will also include a toolbox for helping to align electrophysiological data that is commonly collected in non-human studies, with the brain imaging data.","C-PAC: A configurable, compute-optimized, cloud-enabled neuroimaging analysis software for reproducible translational and comparative",9954159,R24MH114806,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Software Design', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validity of Results', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal data', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cloud based', 'comparative', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'denoising', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'hackathon', 'human imaging', 'image processing', 'improved', 'investigator training', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'software as a service', 'structured data', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,"CHILD MIND INSTITUTE, INC.",R24,2020,545239,-0.0030270796038616766
"Intelligent connectomic analysis tool for dense neuronal circuits Intelligent Connectomic Analysis Tool for Dense Neuronal Circuits Project Summary: The lack of basic understanding of neuronal functions and disease processes is a big factor of failures in creating drugs for neurological diseases. High-resolution maps of the complex connectivity of neuronal circuits correlating with functional and/or molecular markers offer invaluable insights into the functional organization of the neuronal structures, which is a key to understanding the brain in health and disease. There is a strong interest in elucidating and quantifying the connectomics of brain networks with subcellular resolution using electron microscopy (EM) and correlate with functional fluorescence microscopy data. The ultimate goal is to elucidate human brain functions and the mechanisms of human brain disorders. This is critically important to enable new diagnostics and therapies for brain disorders.  The reconstruction and analyses of neuronal networks is challenging in part due to the joint requirement of large volume and high resolution and a large gap in connectomic analysis solutions. There is a strong need for next generation, well supported, integrated, easy to use and highly automated analysis tools to detect and classify neurons, trace arbor branches, identify synapses, spines and synaptic vesicles that increase the throughput of otherwise prohibitively time-consuming analyses in connectomic experiments. There is also a strong need for tools to perform downstream data-driven analysis such as functional inference from structure and phenotypic discovery.  Powered by machine learning and DRVision innovations and collaborating with Dr. Rachel Wong and 9 additional labs, this project proposes to create an intelligent connectomic analysis (ICA) tool optimized for dense neuronal circuits. The tool will be commercially supported and integrated with DRVision’s flagship product Aivia to (1) provide accurate and automated neuron tracing in 3D EM and 3D fluorescence data up to multi-terabytes, (2) identify pre- and post-synaptic dendrite segments, (3) correlate light and electron microscopy data, quantify and classify neurons and sub-cellular components, (4) extract and analyze neuron circuits, (5) provide tools for phenotype discoveries, (6) seamlessly integrate the pipeline of ground truth (GT) annotation, editing, and machine learning workflow, and (7) access the required computing infrastructure, database connection, and exchange of data with other tools.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions. Our methodology reveals various multiscale dynamical processes, relating measured neuronal activity to functional behavior, and has already uncovered activity patterns, dysfunction, and recovery stages.",Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling,10009336,R01EB026936,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Apical', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'behavior prediction', 'brain machine interface', 'computerized data processing', 'control theory', 'data fusion', 'data modeling', 'deep neural network', 'denoising', 'experience', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'high dimensionality', 'mathematical methods', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensorimotor system', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,330552,0.046209234664424635
"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image.

"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9875480,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2020,164298,-0.038873035929291117
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of R01MH074457-13, which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). The overall goal of the BrainMap Project is to provide the human neuroimaging community with curated data sets, metadata, computational tools, and related resources that enable coordinate-based meta-analyses (CBMA), meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), meta-data informed interpretation (“decoding”) of imaging results, and meta-analytic priors for mining (including machine learning) primary (per-subject) neuroimaging data. To date, the BrainMap Project has designed and populated two coordinate-based databases: 1) a task-activation repository (TA DB); and, 2) a voxel-based morphometry repository (VBM DB). The TA DB contains >17,200 experiments, collectively representing > 78,000 subjects and > 110 task- activation paradigms. The VBM DB contains > 3,100 experiments, collectively representing > 81,000 subjects with > 80 psychiatric, neurologic and developmental disorders with ICD-10 coding. The BrainMap Project has created, optimized and validated an integrated pipeline of multi-platform (Javascript), open-access tools to curate (Scribe), filter and retrieve (Sleuth), analyze (GingerALE), visualize (Mango) and interpret analysis output (BrainMap meta-data plugins for Mango). Several network-modeling approaches have been applied to BrainMap data -- MACM, independent components analysis (ICA), graph theory modeling (GTM), author-topic modeling (ATM), structural equation modeling (SEM), and connectivity-based parcellation (CBP) – but none are yet pipeline components. Utilization of these CBMA resources is substantial: BrainMap software, data and meta-data have been used in > 825 peer-reviewed publications. Of these, > 350 were published within the current funding period (April 2015-March 2019; brainmap.org/pubs). In this competing renewal, four tool- development aims are proposed, each of which extends this high-impact research resource. Aim 1. Database Expansion. BrainMap data repositories will be expanded. Aim 2. Meta-analytic Network Modeling. Network modeling will be added to the BrainMap pipeline. Aim 3. Large-Scale Simulations, Comparisons and Validations. Data simulations, characterizations and validations will be performed. Aim 4. Meta-data Inferential tools. Tools for mining BrainMap’s location-linked meta-data will be expanded. Data Sharing Plan. BrainMap data, meta-data, pipeline tools, and templates created by whole-database modeling (e.g., ICA and ATM network masks) are shared at BrainMap.org. Of all new data entries, more than half are contributed by BrainMap users, i.e., community data sharing via BrainMap.org. For community-coded entries, the BrainMap team provides curation and quality control.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10005472,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,628430,0.09151132820442066
"Laboratory of Neuro Imaging Resource (LONIR) PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL The LONIR is focused on developing innovative solutions for the investigation of imaging, genetics, behavioral and clinical data. The LONIR structure is designed to facilitate studies of dynamically changing anatomic frameworks, e.g., developmental, neurodegenerative, traumatic, and metastatic, by providing methods for the comprehensive understanding of the nature and extent of these processes. Specifically, TR&D1 (Data Science) focuses on methodological developments for the management and informatics of brain and related data. This project will develop and issue new methods for robust scientific data management to create an environment where scientific analyses can be reproduced and/or enhanced, data can be easily discovered and reused, and analysis results can be visualized and made publicly searchable. TR&D2 (Diffusion MRI and Connectomics) seeks to advance the study of brain connectivity using diffusion imaging and its powerful extensions. This project will go beyond traditional tensor models of diffusion for assessing tissue and fiber microstructure and connectivity, develop tract-based statistical analysis tools using Deep Learning, introduce novel adaptive connectivity mapping approaches, using L1 fusion of multiple tractography methods, and provide mechanisms to study connectivity and diffusion imaging over 10,000 subjects. (This technology and these methods will be managed and executed by the TR&D1 framework to distributed datasets totaling over 10,000 subjects). Lastly, our TR&D3 (Intrinsic Surface Mapping) develops a general framework for surface mapping in the high dimensional Laplace-Beltrami embedding space via the mathematical optimization of their Riemannian metric. Our approach here overcomes fundamental limitations in existing methods based on spherical registration by eliminating the metric distortion during the parameterization step, thus achieving much improved accuracy in mapping brain anatomy. Coupled with a mature and efficient administrative structure and comprehensive training and dissemination, this program serves a wide and important need in the scientific community.

"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9852566,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data ', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,510889,0.022159253956348615
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10019388,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,381282,0.03156486291971435
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,0.021124422453059264
"Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes PROJECT SUMMARY Overview: We will extend and develop implementations of foundational methods for analyzing populations of attributed connectomes. Our toolbox will enable brain scientists to (1) infer latent structure from individual connectomes, (2) identify meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detect relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes. The methods we develop and extend will naturally overcome the challenges inherent in connectomics: high-dimensional non-Euclidean data with multi-level nonlinear interactions. Our implementations will comply with the highest open-source standards by: providing extensive online documentation and extended tutorials, hosting workshops to demonstrate our tools on an annual basis, and merging our implementations into commonly used packages such as scikit-learn [1], scipy [2], and networkx [3]. All of the code we develop is open source. We strive to ensure that our code is shared in accordance with the strictest guiding principles. We chose to implement these algorithms in Python due to its wide adoption in the neuroscience and data science fields. In particular, many other neuroscience tools applicable to connectomics, including NetworkX DiPy, mindboggle, nilearn, and nipy, are also implemented in Python. This will enable researchers to chain our analysis tools onto pre-existing pipelines for data preprocessing and visualization. Nonetheless, we feel that sharing our code in our own public repositories is insufficient for global reach. We have also begun reaching out to developers of the leading data science packages in python, including scipy, sklearn, networkx, scikit-image, and DiPy. For each of those packages, we have informal approval to begin integrating algorithms that we have developed. Those packages are collectively used by >220,000 other packages, so merging our algorithms into those packages will significantly extend our global reach. All researchers investigating connectomics, including all the authors of the 24,000 papers that mention the word “connectome”, will be able to apply state-of-the-art statistical theory and methods to their data. Currently, we have about 150 open source software projects on our NeuroData GitHub organization. Collectively, these projects get about 2,000 downloads and >11,000 views per month. As we incorporate additional functionality as described in this proposal, we expect far more researchers across disciplines and sectors will utilize our software. 20 ​ ​​ ​ ​​ Project Narrative Connectomes are an increasingly important modality for characterizing the structure of the brain, to complement behavior, genetics, and physiology. We and others have developed foundational statistical theory and methods over the last decade for the analysis of networks, networks with edge, vertex, and other attributes, and populations thereof, with preliminary implementations of those tools that we leverage in our laboratory for various application papers. In this project, we will extend our package, called graspy, to be of professional quality, implementing key functionality to include (1) estimating latent structure from attributed connectomes, (2) identifying meaningful clusters among populations of connectomes, and (3) detecting relationships between connectomes and multivariate phenotypes, such as behavior, genetics, and physiology. 18",Graspy: A python package for rigorous statistical analysis of populations of attributed connectomes,10012519,RF1MH123233,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Coin', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Telecommunications', 'Testing', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'data pipeline', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'high standard', 'open source', 'public repository', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1246005,0.014439291442229885
"CRCNS: US-France Data Sharing Proposal: Lowering the barrier of entry to network neuroscience The field of network neuroscience has developed powerful analysis tools for studying brain networks and holds promise for deepening our understanding of the role played by brain networks in health, disease, development, and cognition. Despite widespread interest, barriers exist that prevent these tools from having broader impact. These include (1) unstandardized practices for sharing and documenting software, (2) long delays from when a method is first introduced to when it becomes publicly available, and (3) gaps in theoretic knowledge and understanding leading to incorrect, delays due to mistakes, and errors in reported results. These barriers ultimately slow the rate of neuroscientific discovery and stall progress in applied domains. To overcome these challenges, we will use open science methods and cloud-computing, to increase the availability of network neuroscience tools. We will use the platform ""brainlife.io"" for sharing these tools, which will be packaged into self-contained, standardized, reproducible Apps, shared with and modified by a community of users, and integrated into existing brainlife.io analysis pipelines. Apps will also be accompanied by links to primary sources, in-depth tutorials, and documentation, and worked-through examples, highlighting their correct usage and offering solutions for mitigating possible pitfalls. In standardizing and packaging network neuroscience tools as Apps, this proposed research will engage a new generation of neuroscientists, providing them powerful new and leading to new discoveries. Second, the proposed research will contribute growing suite of modeling analysis that can be modified to suit specialized purposes. Finally, the Brainlife.io platform will serve as part of the infrastructure supporting neuroscience research. Altogether, these advances will lead to new opportunities in network neuroscience research and further stimulate its growth while increasing synergies with other domains in neuroscience. Structural and functional networks support cognitive processes. Miswiring networks lead to maladaptive behavior and neuropsychicatric disorders. Network neuroscience is a young field that provides a quantitative framework for modeling brain networks. This project will make network neuroscientific tools available to new users via open science and cloud-computing.

"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"RAVE: A New Open Software Tool for Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography Data Project Summary/Abstract  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allows the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded. We use the term ECOG to refer to the entire range of invasive recording techniques (from subdural strips and grids to penetrating electrodes) that share the common attribute of recording neural activity from the human brain with high spatial and temporal resolution. While this ability has resulted in many high-impact advances in understanding fundamental mechanisms of brain function in health and disease, it generates staggering amounts of data as a single patient can be implanted with hundreds of electrodes, each sampled thousands of times a second for hours or even days. The difficulty of exploring these vast datasets is the rate-limiting step in using them to improve human health. We propose to overcome this obstacle by creating an easy-to-use, powerful platform designed from the ground up for the unique properties of ECOG. We dub this software tool RAVE (“R Analysis and Visualization of Electrocorticography data”).  The first goal of Aim 1 is to release RAVE 1.0 to the entire ECOG community by month 6 of the first funding period. This will maximize transformative impact by putting the new tools in the hands of users as quickly as possible, facilitating rapid adoption. The design philosophy of RAVE is driven by three imperatives. The first is to keep users ""close to the data"" so that users may make discoveries about the brain without being misled by artifacts. The second imperative is rigorous statistical methodology. The final imperative is ""play well with others"". As described in Aim 2, our approach will make it easy to seamlessly incorporate new and existing analysis tools written in Matlab, C++, Python or R into RAVE, giving users the best of both worlds: advanced but easy-to-use visualization of results from ECOG experiments, whether they are analyzed with the off-the- shelf tools routines provided with RAVE or novel tools developed by others. Project Narrative  A fast-growing technique in human neuroscience is electrocorticography (ECOG), the only technique that allow the activity of small population of neurons in the human brain to be directly recorded with high spatial and temporal resolution. ECOG generates staggering amounts of data, and the rate-limiting step in generating new insights about the human brain is the difficulty in exploring this vast quantity of data.

"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration PROJECT SUMMARY The cell nucleus is a heterogeneous organelle that consists of nuclear bodies such as nuclear lamina, speckles, nucleoli and PML bodies. These structures continuously tether and tug chromatin at the small and large scales to synergistically orchestrate dynamic functions in distinct spatio-temporal compartments. A major obstacle to the production of navigable 4D reference maps and relating structure to function in the nucleus remains understanding how these different scales of organization influence each other. In particular, we have a poor understanding of the large-scale genome organization. Growing evidence suggests that such nuclear compartmentalization is causally connected with vital genome functions in human health and disease. However, the principles of this nuclear compartmentalization, its dynamics during changes in cell conditions, and its functional relevance are poorly understood. One lesson from Phase 1 4DN was the huge gap in throughput between imaging methods, that directly measure large-scale multi-landmark relationships, and genomic methods, that aim for whole genome high-resolution maps but are indirect measurements and provide limited information about large-scale compartments. For this 4DN UM1 Center application, we propose to meet these needs through the following Aims: (1) Generate multi-modal imaging and genomic datasets to reveal the structure, dynamics, and function of nuclear compartmentalization; (2) Develop and apply computational tools for data-driven genome structure modeling and integrative analysis of nuclear compartmentalization; (3) Develop an integrative analysis and visualization platform with navigable 4D reference maps of nuclear organization. The combined datasets and results of our proposed approaches will advance our understanding of nuclear compartmentalization, the interwoven connections among different nuclear components, and their functional significance. Our new integrative analysis tools and data-driven predictive models will produce more complete nuclear organization reference maps that integrate large-scale chromosome structure data from live and super-resolution microscopy with multi-modal genomic data including smaller scale chromatin interaction maps and predict functional relationships and dynamic responses. Our navigable reference maps will be publicly accessible through an analysis platform that provides interactive visualization of multiple data types, thus enabling investigators with diverse expertise to simultaneously explore their own data and related datasets/tools and promoting collaborations that will open new horizons into the role of the 4D nucleome in human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will enhance our understanding of nuclear genome organization and functions that are increasingly being linked to health and disease. Because we develop tools to disseminate this information and enable others to work with our data and their own data, we will also bring nuclear architecture to bear on a broad range of ongoing health related research. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to NIH’s mission that seeks to obtain fundamental knowledge that will help to improve human health.",Multiscale Analyses of 4D Nucleome Structure and Function by Comprehensive Multimodal Data Integration,10156141,UM1HG011593,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Loop', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytology', 'DNA Replication Timing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interphase Chromosome', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell cycle genetics', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data exploration', 'data integration', 'data tools', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental function', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'multiscale data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'structured data', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,UM1,2020,2075409,0.005433129201417215
"2/2 Discovery and validation of neuronal enhancers associated with the development of psychiatric disorders In this project, we will develop novel methods for finding brain-specific enhancers, build regulatory networks, deconvolve brain-region-specific regulation, and relate differential enhancer signals to variations in the human population. We will then apply these analytical methods to the psychENCODE data corpus, integrating these data with GTEx, ENCODE, and CommonMind data, annotating GWAS SNPs associated with psych disease, prioritizing the discovered regulatory elements for validation, and visualizing all psychENCODE data in an integrated fashion. We will then validate these predicted regulatory elements using large-scale genomic assays in neuroblastoma cells, iPSC cells, and neuronal precursor cells differentiated into neuronal lineages, and using a microfluidics platform capable of culturing neuronal cells and neuronal organoids. The results from these studies will further our understanding of the genetic regulatory basis for neuronal function in both normal and neuropsychiatric disease states. The data generated by the psychENCODE Consortium are a pre-eminent, centralized resource for studying the human brain. We will develop cutting-edge analytical methods and apply them to the psychENCODE data corpus to identify regulatory elements and then validate them using large-scale genomic assays in neuronal cells and organoids.
