"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9846025,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,449973,0.1514767941641678
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time. Our project will develop and optimize a new method in which machine learning tools are used to decode EEG-based neural signals to characterize the time-course of competition. Such a method offers the prospect of a diagnostic tool to identify young children who are at risk for communication disorders.",Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition,9650473,R21DC017596,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Orthography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'millisecond', 'named group', 'neurotransmission', 'oculomotor', 'phonology', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'specific language impairment', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R21,2019,277714,0.06800989755920647
"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9792276,R01NS084142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Impact Seizures', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neurophysiology', 'parallel computer', 'relating to nervous system', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,613085,0.16338626316022997
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9750274,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,543993,0.2160490847798357
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9737997,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'brain research', 'central database', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,593300,0.21442979441110765
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity.

To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9594591,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,561118,0.2160490847798357
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG? ?source? ?dynamics? ?and? ?results? ?of? ?existing? ?research? ?using? ?fMRI? ?and? ?other? ?brain? ?imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9597164,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'light weight', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,604808,0.21442979441110765
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. The neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform these analyses and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data.

"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major shift in scientific perspective on the nature and use of electrophysiological brain data is now ongoing a shift from measurement and visualization of individual channel signals (in the 'recording channel space') to visualizing and interpreting the data directly within a suitable inverse model representing activity reaching the electrodes by volume conduction from a set of effective data sources in native 'brain source space'. An equivalent shift, via the development and exploitation of an appropriate inverse imaging model, made possible the phenomenon of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While the electrophysiological inverse problem is still difficult, dramatic progress has been and is being made through combined use of multimodal imaging and modern statistical signal processing methods. Recovering the considerable degree of spatial source resolution available in high-density scalp electroencephalographic (EEG) and other electrophysiological data, while retaining its natural advantage over other functional imaging methods in temporal resolution, has begun to yield a steady stream of new information about patterns of distributed brain processing supporting human behavior and experience. Relative to other brain imaging modalities, EEG has substantial and increasing cost and mobility advantages, making promotion of new EEG methods for source space analysis of increasing interest and importance for brain and health research. However, applying new source signal and signal processing models to electrophysiological data is complex and increasingly involves application of modern mathematical methods whose details are not within the training of most health research professionals.

"Scalable EEG interpretation using Deep Learning and Schema Descriptors ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic medical records (EMRs) collected at every hospital in the country collectively contain a staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge. EMRs can include unstructured text, temporally constrained measurements (e.g., vital signs), multichannel signal data (e.g., EEGs), and image data (e.g., MRIs). This information could be transformative if properly harnessed. Information about patient medical problems, treatments, and clinical course is essential for conducting comparative effectiveness research. Uncovering clinical knowledge that enables comparative research is the primary goal of this proposal. We will focus on the automatic interpretation of clinical EEGs collected over 12 years at Temple University Hospital (over 25,000 sessions and 15,000 patients). Clinicians will be able to retrieve relevant EEG signals and EEG reports using standard queries (e.g. ""Young patients with focal cerebral dysfunction who were treated with Topamax""). In Aim 1 we will automatically annotate EEG events that contribute to a diagnosis. We will develop automated techniques to discover and time-align the underlying EEG events using semi-supervised learning. In Aim 2 we will process the text from the EEG reports using state-of-the-art clinical language processing techniques. Clinical concepts, their type, polarity and modality shall be discovered automatically, as well as spatial and temporal information. In addition, we shall extract the medical concepts describing the clinical picture of patients from the EEG reports. In Aim 3, we will develop a patient cohort retrieval system that will operate on the clinical knowledge extracted in Aims 1 and 2. In addition we shall organize this knowledge in a unified representation: the Qualified Medical Knowledge Graph (QMKG), which will be built using BigData solutions through MapReduce. The QMKG will be able to be searched by biomedical researchers as well as practicing clinicians. The QMKG will also provide a characterization of the way in which events in an EEG are narrated by physicians and the validation of these across a BigData resource. The EMKG represents an important contribution to basic science. In Aim 4 we will validate the usefulness of the patient cohort identification system by collecting feedback from clinicians and medical students who will participate in a rigorous evaluation protocol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the queries shall be designed and experts will provide relevance judgments for the results. For each query, medical experts shall examine the top-ranked cohorts for common precision errors (false positives) and the bottom five ranked common recall errors (false negatives). User validation testing will be performed using live clinical data and the feedback wil enhance the quality of the cohort identification system. The existence of an annotated BigData archive of EEGs will greatly increase accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics who would like to study EEG data. The creation of this resource through the development of efficient automated data wrangling techniques will demonstrate that a much wider range of BigData bioengineering applications are now tractable. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary goal of this proposal is to enable comparative research by automatically uncovering clinical knowledge from a vast BigData archive of clinical EEG signals and EEG reports collected over the past 12 years at Temple University Hospital. In the proposed project, we will develop a proof-of-concept based on the discovery of patient cohorts and provide an annotated BigData archive as well as the software that enabled the annotations and the generation of the patient cohort retrieval system. This resource will be accompanied by a novel medical knowledge representation generated with MapReduce, greatly increasing accessibility for non- experts in neuroscience, bioengineering and medical informatics, and demonstrating the transformative potential of mining the staggering wealth of biomedical knowledge available in hospital medical records.",Scalable EEG interpretation using Deep Learning and Schema Descriptors,9243724,U01HG008468,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Country', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Discharge from eye', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Medical Students', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multimedia', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualifying', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'base', 'career', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data archive', 'data wrangling', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'inclusion criteria', 'information organization', 'language processing', 'novel', 'repository']",NHGRI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,U01,2016,374745,0.15382044897654307

"Learned regulation of the limbic network via combined EEG and fMRI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop a novel potential treatment for common neuropsychiatric disorders, specifically chronic pain syndrome and affective disorders including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We have previously shown that real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) can provide a feedback signal (neurofeedback) that allows people to gain learned voluntary control of activation in the rostral anterior cingulate (rACC), which in turn alters pain perception. Here, we aim to develop a brain-validated electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback method that involves simultaneous EEG and fMRI recordings. This system will then be used to determine EEG signatures reflective of regulation of rACC and of the amygdala. Multiple psychiatric states (e.g., depressive, anxious) are associated with an inability to regulate emotion and appear to be characterized by dysfunction of the limbic circuit including the ACC and amygdala. However, current psychiatric treatment approaches typically lack specificity regarding brain networks and mechanisms. Based on research studies indicating that individuals can be trained to regulate their own mental and physiological responses through online feedback, the proposed study aims to develop a novel tool for enhancing physiological resilience through psychological training using brain signals as the basis for such feedback. Thus, neurofeedback can provide a potential, complementary/alternate approach for treatment of neuropsychiatric disturbances. The combination of simultaneously acquired high spatial-resolution fMRI data and high temporal-resolution EEG data together with advanced statistical learning approaches provide a plausible way to infer and generate a robust and effective EEG neurofeedback signals that can target even deep brain structures such as the rACC or amygdala as the source of feedback. Given the high prevalence of psychopathology and the non-specific targeting of current treatments, the development of a robust method for learned regulation of specific limbic regions is important. Specifically, the new EEG-neurofeedback tool could be a novel, rational, neuroscience-based therapeutic intervention that could become a portable, easy-to-use, and low-cost clinical tool for improving self-control over brain working. In the long-term such a technique could be useful in alleviating chronic pain and regulating emotional instability and agony in cases of depression and anxiety syndromes.          The inability to self-regulate our affective/mental states is an underlying cause of multiple disorders, including chronic pain syndrome, depression, and anxiety that have serious social and psychological consequences. This project aims to develop a novel system that enables people to learn to regulate pain and emotion, which could lead to improved outcomes for major neuropsychiatric diseases that are often unresponsive to current treatments.

"Fusion of Electromagnetic Brain Imaging and fMRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. We propose to develop state-of-the-art multimodal functional imaging fusion algorithms for accurate visualization of the brain's dynamic activity and high spatial and temporal resolution. We propose to develop algorithms that combine complementary high spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI) and high-temporal resolution of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) data for high-fidelity reconstruction of brain activity. In recent years, our research group has developed a suite of novel and powerful algorithms for MEG/EEG imaging superior to existing benchmark algorithms, and we have compared these results with electrocorticography (ECOG). Specifically, our algorithms can solve for many brain sources, including sources located far from the sensors, in the presence of large interference from unrelated brain sources using fast and robust probabilistic inference techniques. Here, we propose to extend this success in M/EEG inverse algorithms into the domain of multimodal imaging data fusion. Our overall goal here is to ultimately produce robust, high fidelity videos of event-related brain activation at a sub-millimeter and sub-millisecond resolution from noisy MEG/EEG and fMRI data using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Specifically, we propose to extend a powerful new algorithm that we have recently developed, called Champagne, into two new fusion algorithms that combine fMRI, MEG and EEG data in different ways. Performance of both algorithms will first be rigorously evaluated in simulations, including performance comparisons with existing benchmark fusion algorithms. Algorithms will then tested for consistency on four fMRI-MEG+EEG datasets from healthy controls obtained for identical paradigms (auditory, motor, picture naming and verb-generation) and two fMRI-EEG datasets (face and motion perception). Additional validation studies will also be performed on fMRI-MEG/EEG datasets obtained from epilepsy patients and compared to electrocorticography (ECoG). Following successful testing and evaluation, all algorithms developed in this grant proposal, as well as example validation datasets, will be distributed using NUTMEG (nutmeg.berkeley.edu), an open-source software toolbox that we have developed.        Multimodal non-invasive functional brain imaging has made a tremendous impact in improving our understanding of the neural correlates of human behavior, and is now an indispensable tool for systems and cognitive neuroscientists. With the development of appropriate analytical tools, multimodal functional brain imaging is in the process of revolutionizing the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, dementia, and epilepsy that affect tens of millions of Americans.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG  Project Summary/Abstract Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.  Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.",Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG,8288263,R33DA026109,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Atlases', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug user', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Four-dimensional', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methamphetamine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'base', 'blind', 'chronic pain', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'craving', 'data space', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'human subject', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'machine abstracting', 'method development', 'mind control', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'trend', 'virtual', 'volunteer']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R33,2012,566794,0.057698434094206386

"A Non-invasive Single-trial In-vivo Neuroimaging System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The overall goal of this project is to develop an integrated single-trial system for neuroimaging which combines high-density electroencephalography (EEG) with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and to use this system to investigate variability in neural processing. The high-temporal resolution of EEG will enable the detection of signal variability in single-trial events, and this information will be used as the input function for analysis of simultaneously acquired event-related fMRI (efMRl). We hypothesize that using single-trial EEG derived regressors for efMRI (stEEG/fMRI) will yield high spatial and high temporal resolution information about the functional neuroanatomy involved in cognitive processing. This will enable construction of unique EEG derived tMRI activation maps which are not based on pre-defined labels or observed behavioral responses but rather on task and subject specific electrophysiological source variability. The broad impact of this work will be development of a new non-invasive imaging system (stEEG/fMRI) for the cognitive neurosciences as well as a clinical tool for diagnosis and monitoring of a broad spectrum of neurological diseases. The R21 effort focuses on development of a high density (64 channels) EEG/fMRI integrated system for single-trial analysis, and characterization of possible differences between the EEG recorded in an MR environment and that recorded in a standard environment.

Develop an in-magnet 64 channel EEG system for single-trial analysis of event-related potentials recorded concurrently with fMRI. 2. Assess the quality of EEG collected inside the MR scanner compared to that collected in a shielded EEG room, using a series of predefined protocols for characterizing the effects of the auditory and magnetic environments on EEG and ERP wave forms. 3.

"Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Individuals with epilepsy, their families and the professionals that treat them have long felt the need for reliable warning of an impending epileptic seizure. In Phase I, we developed a unique, multi-parameter, individualized, trainable seizure predetection system which extracts spectral, wavelet and time domain features and uses recurrent neural networks to analyze many hours of multichannel EEG and predetect seizure onsets with a high level of accuracy and reliability. The underlying analytical software for this system was tested on large database of scalp EEG recordings from five epilepsy centers and contained over 373 hours of recordings from 17 patients containing 50 seizures. This is a large database compared to those reported by most investigators in this field. Phase I results were very accurate and reliable (sensitivity: 100%, false positive rate 0.02/hr and detection times that occurred an average of 9.1 seconds, before seizure onset). This is entirely acceptable for our primary target application, of warning of a seizure onset to enable timely diagnostic injection to locate the brain region where the seizure starts using SPECT imaging. In Phase II we will refine the detection process, validate performance in a large data set, implement the software in C++ modules, and test the commercial prototype in a clinical setting. These steps will result in a company supported Phase III product development, integration into existing EEG recording systems, beta testing and commercialization. While Phase 2 will concentrate on the SPECT application using scalp electrodes, the scalp EEG techniques developed will be applicable without change for general use in an epilepsy monitoring facility to alert staff of impending seizures and allow them to attend to patient safety in a timely manner. Predetection will also facilitate neuropsychological or other testing in the epilepsy monitoring environment. With additional work, the techniques developed can be applied to ambulatory devices for seizure alert, or for episodic vagal nerve stimulation to block seizures. n/a",Trainable Early Warning System for Epileptic Seizures,7109311,R44NS039214,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain disorder diagnosis', 'brain electrical activity', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain mapping', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'early diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'neuropsychology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient monitoring device', 'radiotracer', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,"CHATTEN ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2006,400929,0.18440201447098584

"Intelligent Adaptive Wireless Reconfigurable EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant)  The overall goal of the proposal is to improve ambulatory and long-term EEG monitoring using an innovative wireless EEG system. The specific aim of this proposal is to develop an ambulatory wireless EEG monitoring system with real-time adaptive and re-configuration capabilities, which will allow more clinical data to be transmitted in the same bandwidth and in a small portable package. The proposed device will adapt its data acquisition hardware to the underlying clinical event permitting it to focus its high transmission rates to periods of clinically relevant events. The events will be detected by our powerful seizure monitor algorithm which will have direct control over a flexible and innovative hardware. The result is enhanced wireless EEG in a small package, low power and with data quality comparable to bulkier clinical tethered system. The ability to optimize bandwidth is timely due to new FDA telemetry guidelines, which restricts the availability of frequencies and bandwidths in medical devices. Another advantage to optimizing output is that more meaningful data can be created without excessively large data files, which will speed analysis and review. Finally, the proposed device will be able to dynamically reconfigure itself in real time to compensate for serious data-corrupting events such as when one or several electrodes become loose or detached. In summary, the two major innovations are: 1- Real-time adaptive capability for adjusting the quantity and quality of the acquired and transmitted EEG data to better reflect the underlying clinical event (such as a seizure), 2- more practical and accurate ambulatory monitoring by the real-time automatic reconfiguration of the EEG acquisition system.       In Phase I, we designed, fabricated and tested a prototype system. Bench top and clinical testing showed that the system can indeed modify its output in response to artifacts or changes in EEG morphology.

"Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG is a valuable non-invasive clinical tool in numerous applications, from the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases to the clinical monitoring of neurological injuries, sleep disorders and depth of anesthesia.  However, EEG signals are very susceptible to various artifacts which seriously impede the EEG interpretation and compromise its therapeutic capabilities. Methods currently employed for removing artifacts from EEG recordings are not clinically effective or feasible for real-time and long-term neuro-monitoring. Hence, the overall goal of this project is to develop a novel, high-fidelity artifact identification and removal technique that will be specifically useful for ambulatory EEG recording and intervention.      The proposed novel artifact removal technique is based on the Wavelet-Based Artifact Removal (WBAR) method, which exploits the excellent time-frequency localization of artifacts provided by the wavelet decomposition. The WBAR method is computationally very efficient and allows for simultaneous, real-time removal of a variety of EEG artifacts. It has been recently developed by the PI and tested for a single EEG channel in an extensive clinical study as part of a novel depth-of-anesthesia monitor.       The WBAR method will be improved by combining it with the Wavelet Neural Networks for the precise artifact classification, and recursive EEG Parameterization methods for the reliable estimation of the corrupted EEG components. The combination of these methods will result in fully automated, real-timeartifact removal technique that maximally preserves valid EEG information.       The development and implementation of this novel method will greatly enhance the functionality and  utilization of Cleveland Medical Devices' entire line of ambulatory wireless EEG/PSG systems. n/a",Wireless EEG/PSG System with Novel Artifact Removal,6792393,R43NS046978,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'electroencephalography', 'human subject', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research', 'polysomnography', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'sleep']",NINDS,"CLEVELAND MEDICAL DEVICES, INC.",R43,2004,204478,0.2753203679591736
"Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG   DESCRIPTION: (provided by applicant) The identification of electrographic            seizures during long-term EEG monitoring in the neonate is currently based upon      visual interpretation of the graphic record, a process that is very                  time-consuming. While significant progress has been made in the automated            detection of seizures in the adult population, relatively little work has been       done in the neonatal area. Therefore, the major objective of this project is         the development of techniques for the reliable automated detection of                electrographic seizures in the neonatal EEG. We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6780874,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', 'age difference', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical equipment development', 'brain electrical activity', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'electroencephalography', 'epilepsy', 'human subject', 'newborn human (0-6 weeks)', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2004,194888,0.24118191710410516

We propose a multi-stage, hybrid        approach to detection that will employ a combination of signal processing,           pattern recognition, neural networks, and expert rules. Through the successive       stages of the detection process, multichannel neonatal EEG data containing all       types of background activity and artifacts will be analyzed to detect and            classify electrographic seizures. We postulate that the varied types and             morphologies of seizures in the neonatal EEG, as compared to seizures in the         adult EEG, can best be detected and classified using this hybrid approach. We        will test the methods we develop on data recorded from infants in the Clinical       Research Center for Neonatal Seizures, The Methodist Hospital, in Houston,           Texas. We expect that the information we gain from the research will lead to         the development of a practical seizure detection system and further our              long-term goals of reduced expense in the reading and interpretation of              neonatal EEGs, and also facilitate the efficient collection of seizure               parameters for possible use in future research studies.                                                                                                                   n/a",Epileptic Seizures in the Neonatal EEG,6642804,R01NS040577,"['adult human (21+)', ' age difference', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain electrical activity', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' electroencephalography', ' epilepsy', ' human subject', ' newborn human (0-6 weeks)', ' patient monitoring device', ' patient oriented research']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2003,193637,0.24118191710410516

"Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps   DESCRIPTION (Verbatim from the Applicant's Abstract): A software system based        on Artificial Neuro-fuzzy hybrid technology will be developed for automatic          detection of microsleep events from EEG data. The software system will be            designed for used as a model-free and rule-free classification tool that             achieves generalization power through learning from examples.   The development of the software system will require a Graphical User Interface       for data example selection, frequency-analytic preprocessing of EEG raw data,        feature extraction for microsleep characterization, design and training of           neural networks for single EEG channels, and a fuzzy system for contextual           combination of network response for multiple EEG channels to a single system         response.                                                                                                                       The training and testing of the neural networks will be based on a database of       visually scored examples of microsleep and non-microsleep events from                electrophysiological data, which will be randomly divided into training,             validation and test sets.                                                                                 The performnance of the software system will be evaluated based on the               false-positive and false-negative rate for the microsleep detection using data       examples unknown to the system. The agreement rate between the combined network      response and results from visual and conventional automatic scoring will be          used as additional evaluation parameter.        PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION: The software system will be an attractive tool for researchers, medical and technical  personal, industrial engineers. It enables the user to quantify alertness/sleepiness  in studies on sleep disorders, shiftwork, drug effects and fatigue countermeasures.  It will help reduce time-consuming visual scoring by human experts. In addition, it  will widen our knowledge about the rapid transition events (microsleeps) between  wake and sleep and can contribute to the development of alertness monitor systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      n/a",Neural Network System for Detection of EEG Microsleeps,6338195,R43NS039711,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer data analysis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data collection methodology /evaluation', ' electroencephalography', ' electrophysiology', ' human data', ' neural information processing', ' sleep']",NINDS,"CIRCADIAN TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2001,93457,0.1540023132519734

"MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA COMPRESSION Recently, recording high-resolution Electroencephalograms (EEGs) from            a large number of electrodes has become a clear trend in both brain              research and clinical diagnosis.  However, the current EEG data                  acquisition systems store the collected data in a form that has never            changed since digital EEG emerged about 30 years ago.  As a result, the          size of the output data file increases enormously as the number of               recording channels increases, causing various problems including high            costs in data analysis, database management, archiving, and transmission         through the internet.                                                                                                                                             This proposal seeks to solve this problem through fundamental research           on data compression specifically for EEG data, but applicable to other           physiological data as well.  Our key approach is based on the                    application of advanced mathematical and signal processing technologies          to this critical problem.  We will develop and optimize a variable               sampling technique which eliminates redundant data samples using spline          interpolation and wavelet transformation.  We will also investigate              lossless data compression algorithms that possess two important                  features: 1) any part of the data within the compressed file can be read         without having to decompress the entire file, and 2) the compressed data         can be transmitted and presented in coarse or fine resolutions as                needed.

"CLUSTERING AND HYPER-LINKING OF LONG-TERM EEGS The proposed work offers enhancements to the MagicMarker software developed in Phase I.  This software offers a new methodology for the display and analysis of long-term EEG records.  Epochs of similar activity are grouped into segments and then states via two-pass hierarchial clustering.  This results in clearly differentiated background, paroxysmal activity and patient state transitions.  The underlying EEG  is always available via hyper- links so that artifacts can be distinguished from ""real EEG."" The Phase II work adds classification abilities (intelligence) to the Phase I software.  Proposed are an expert-level seizure detector, an ICU abnormality detector and a user-defined activity detector.  The effort includes the development of a large library of carefully analyzed and annotated prolonged EEG studies. Newborns, older children and adults will be included ensuring robust algorithms for all age groups. The proposed software greatly reduces staff requirements for long-term monitoring through intelligent notification (visual, audible and dial-up pager) of interesting events.  This, in addition to the ability to monitor patients ""away from the lab,"" provides more frequent patient checks and improved clinical outcomes. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATION The proposed software would be a valuable addition to any digital EEG because of the great timesavings it provides for both neurologists and EEG technicians.

"STATISTICAL TOOLS--BIOELECTROMAGNETIC SOURCE ESTIMATION Functional imaging techniques are important to brain researchers and clinicians alike because many phenomena cannot be observed by anatomical techniques alone. Among functional imaging methods, only magneto- and electro-encephalography (MEG, EEG, or jointly M/EEG) can noninvasively resolve events with a millisecond time scale. Statistical tools for M/BEG functional brain imaging software will be developed to estimate and visualize the spatial extent and time course of brain activity. Algorithms will be developed for the incorporation of a priori information into source estimation, and for estimating the uncertainty of the estimates. These tools will permit the use of information derived from anatomy, physiology, and other functional imaging modalities (such as fMR1 and PET) to be combined with M/EEG data to improve the robustness, reliability, and objectivity of the M/EEG analysis. The algorithms will be incorporated into prototype software, and the software validated with both simulated and experimental data. The software will comprise a PC/Windows-based program suite for analysis and display. The algorithms and resulting software may be used to study both normal brain function, such as measurements in cognitive neuroscience which may be studied with evoked response/event related potentials or spontaneous EEG, and in diseases of the brain, such as the epilepsies, where precise spatial and temporal resolution may be of value for diagnosis and presurgical evaluation. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The techniques which we propose are a non-invasive, non-radiological and relatively low cost addition to existing EEG, MEG and MRI systems, and provides information which is not currently available from these systems independently. The resulting software will have direct application in clinical and cognitive neuroscience research.

"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Epilepsy is the world’s most prominent serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For about 30% of these patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite optimal medical management, with attendant effects on health and quality of life. In order to enable advances in the therapeutic management of epilepsy, a thorough understanding of how cellular processes that drive seizures are linked to large-scale network effects is needed. While seizures impact large brain areas and often multiple lobes, the driving processes span regions on the scale of millimeters. These have been well characterized in animal models, but the relevance to human seizures, i.e. how seizures are driven by brain signals from small-scale processes remains unclear. Instead, the view that naturally-occurring seizures may be attributable instead to large-scale neural mass effects (i.e., the epileptic network) is a subject of ongoing debate. Previously, we defined a key role for surround inhibition in shaping EEG recordings of seizures at the onset site and on small spatial scales. We now propose that surround inhibition has a dual role. On a millimeter scale, its abrupt failure permits the advance of a seizure. At long distances from the seizure focus, strong local inhibition serves to mask the excitatory effects of seizures and may help to hasten seizure termination, while weakened inhibition may permit emergence of ictal activity at a distant, noncontiguous seizure site. Multiple seizure foci may go unrecognized with standard EEG interpretation methods, and are likely a critical factor in epilepsy surgery failures. We hypothesize that once established, multiple ictal generators behave as delay-coupled oscillators, demonstrating activity that is synchronized or even temporally reversed. This results in complex and at times counterintuitive network behavior that can be challenging to reverse engineer from EEG recordings. Typically, however, even intracranial EEG recordings provide only a limited view of neural activity. In this project, an interdisciplinary research group with combined expertise in epilepsy, clinical neurophysiology, computational modeling, and mathematics will conduct a comprehensive study of the neuronal contributors to epileptic networks utilizing a unique combined dataset of simultaneous microelectrode and macroelectrode recordings of human seizures. Using a machine learning approach, we will apply this information to develop a multivariate EEG biomarker based on the inferred source of EEG discharges, high frequency oscillations, and very low frequency (DC) shifts and assess its predictive value for post-resection surgical outcome. We anticipate that the project will lead to a theoretical framework for rational development of innovative strategies for developing interventions to control seizures. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to identify the cellular mechanisms of epileptic networks, a critical barrier to developing treatments based on epileptic network analysis and manipulation. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will address this problem by analyzing and modeling multiscale voltage data from epilepsy patients, and utilizing the results to develop a new multivariate biomarker for seizure-generating brain areas.",Dynamics of long range network interactions  in focal epilepsy,9972766,R01NS084142,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Focal Seizure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Impact Seizures', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'millimeter', 'minimally invasive', 'multi-scale modeling', 'neurophysiology', 'parallel computer', 'relating to nervous system', 'support vector machine', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,615913,0.16338626316022997
"Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The high rate of failure in CNS drug discovery, in particular of the first-in-class therapeutics with new modes of action, highlights a clear unmet need to improve the success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders. One well-known issue is the poor ability of current bioassays and animal models to predict the efficacy and side-effects of compounds. In response, there is a steady growth in the use of electroencephalogram (EEG) in clinical trials in recent years. Pharmaceutical companies are incorporating EEG more often in their preclinical drug discovery efforts because the high degree of translatability of EEG from rodents to humans makes it ideal to use in de-risking programs in drug discovery. Moreover, quantitative EEG (qEEG) is an objective measurement of brain activity with a high test-retest reliability and considerable predictive, face, and construct validity. Additionally, well-documented literature shows that certain classes of drugs elicit different EEG fingerprints, suggesting that EEG yields pharmaco-dynamic signatures specific to pharmacological action and can be used to enable classification of drugs based on the effects of the EEG. Further, EEG can be used to rapidly screen compounds for potential activity at specific pharmacological targets and provide valuable information for guiding the early stages of drug development. However, to date, no EEG-based tool is broadly available to be used to predict the therapeutic utility of unknown compounds for drug discovery in psychiatric disorders. In order to develop such a tool, PsychoGenics, Inc., is leveraging our existing expertise in performing high-throughput pharmaco-sleep-EEG studies and our established proprietary machine learning approach to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications or underlying mechanism of action (MOA; i.e. the neurotransmitter system/receptor targets) of unknown compounds for psychiatric disorders. Our aims are 1) to generate a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG) database of compounds with a known mechanism and therapeutic value in mice, and 2) to develop a classifier using supervised machine learning. The success of this Phase I SBIR project will result in a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications and MOA of new compounds based on their EEG profiles. In a future Phase II project, we will 1) add in auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) database, 2) test our EEGCube by conducting a phenotypic drug discovery project with our established collaborator (see letters of support), 3) investigate whether integrating the EEGcube database with our SmartCube® database of same compounds helps better understand the circuitry responsible for behavioral responses and/or achieves even greater prediction power in identifying therapeutic indication of novel compounds and 4) explore EEG signatures of transgenic mouse models of disease and investigate use of their signatures to identify potential therapies for the respective diseases based on EEG. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an unmet need to improve success rate in drug discovery for psychiatric disorders due to the high rate of failure. Given the high degree of translatability of electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to humans, PsychoGenics, Inc., proposes to develop a novel EEG-based drug discovery platform that can predict therapeutic indications, underlying mechanism of action, and/or compound liabilities to guide the early stages of drug development.","Development of a novel pharmaco-EEG based, high-throughput screening platform to facilitate drug discovery for psychiatric disorders",9983443,R43MH121136,"['Animal Model', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacologic Actions', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rights', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinically relevant', 'drug classification', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'side effect', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2020,88432,0.1514767941641678
"EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics Electroencephalography (EEG), the first function brain activity imaging modality, has several natural advantages over metabolic brain imaging modalities. EEG is noninvasive, low cost, and lightweight enough to be highly mobile. Two major shifts in scientific perspective on the nature and use of human electrophysiological data are now ongoing. The first is a shift to using EEG data as a source-resolved, relatively high-resolution cortical source imaging modality. The EEGLAB signal processing environment, an open source software project of the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN) of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), began as a set of EEG data analysis running on Matlab (The Mathworks, Inc.) released by Makeig on the World Wide Web in 1997. EEGLAB was first released from SCCN in 2001. Now nearly twenty years later, the EEGLAB reference paper [4] has over 6,750 citations (now increasing by over 4 per day), the opt-in EEGLAB discussion email list links 6,000 researchers, the EEGLAB news list over 15,000 researchers, and an independent 2011 survey of 687 research respondents reported EEGLAB to be the software environment most widely used for electrophysiological data analysis in cognitive neuroscience. Our statistics show that after over the past four years, EEGLAB adoption is still growing steadily. Here, we will develop a framework for thorough comparison of preprocessing methods, and will apply machine learning methods on the large body of data collected by our laboratory to build optimized, automated data processing pipelines. We will greatly augment the power of the EEGLAB environment by providing a cross-study meta-analysis capability and will revise the software architecture to use a file and metadata organization compatible with the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) framework first developed for fMRI/MRI data archiving. These tools will integrate the HED annotating system allowing for meta-analysis across large corpus of studies. We will implement beamforming within EEGLAB. We will develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework for clustering effective sources on multiple measures across subjects and studies, and will develop tools to perform statistical testing on information flow measures at these scales. Although EEG and MEG recording have co- existed for four decades, little available software can combine both data types, recorded concurrently (`MEEG' data), to enhance source separation. We recently showed that ICA decomposition also allows joint MEEG effective source decomposition and will integrate MEG and joint MEEG data decomposition and imaging into the EEGLAB tool set. We will build tools to use MRI- and fMRI-derived anatomical atlases to inform the interpretation of EEG and MEG brain source dynamics. These radical improvements will further the use of non-invasive human electrophysiology for 3-D functional cortical brain imaging in the U.S. and worldwide, thereby accelerating progress in noninvasive basic and clinical human brain research using highly time- and space-resolved measures of brain electromagnetic dynamics. The EEGLAB signal processing environment is now used in many electrophysiological research and teaching laboratories worldwide. To accelerate progress in basic and clinical cognitive neuroscience, we will continue maintenance and development of the EEGLAB environment, introducing new tools for source separation and localization, source clustering, automatic artifact management, and across-studies meta-analysis, and will extend its scope to process magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and joint EEG/MEG data and to highlight parallels between EEG/MEG source dynamics and results of existing research using fMRI and other brain imaging.",EEGLAB: Software for Analysis of Human Brain Dynamics,9971588,R01NS047293,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distributed Databases', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Mail', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Links List', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Newsletter', 'Paper', 'Plug-in', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Respondent', 'Running', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'brain research', 'central database', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'cost', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data cleaning', 'data infrastructure', 'data structure', 'data visualization', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'light weight', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'news', 'novel strategies', 'online course', 'open source', 'research study', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'teaching laboratory', 'tool', 'wiki']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,588823,0.21442979441110765
"Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition Project Summary  Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time.  The overall goal of this proposal is to capitalize on recent developments in multivariate and machine- learning techniques for analyzing signals obtained from the human brain to measure the real-time unfolding of spoken word recognition. Although these techniques have been most widely used with fMRI data, we propose to extend them to EEG data because EEG is easily used with children and clinical populations, and provides access to the time-course of word recognition, thereby revealing underlying cognitive mechanisms of word recognition, such as lexical competition. Our preliminary findings using this EEG-based paradigm have demonstrated that we can decode the recognition of a specific word (among a set of 8-12 alternatives) at each msec time-step after stimulus onset. The method is sensitive to partial activation of competing words that share some phonological features with the target word, thereby revealing the dynamics of lexical competition as the word-recognition system settles on the final target.  Our objectives are to conduct a series of small-scale experiments that achieve three aims. First, we develop and optimize the method with adults (e.g., the experimental procedure and computational implementation). Second, we validate the method with adults by measuring its test/re-test reliability, comparing its estimates of word recognition with traditional behavioral paradigms, and examining how lexical status, and semantic and orthographic expectations shape lexical competition revealed by the EEG measure. This will yield a new, non-invasive, and highly reliable method suitable for assessing spoken word recognition in adults, children, and special populations. Third, we will preliminarily extend the method to children to pave the way for future developmental studies. Taken together, accomplishing these three aims would provide an innovative and powerful tool for assessing a crucial component of language processing in a wide variety of typical and atypical populations. Project Narrative The proposed research will impact public health by establishing a new EEG-based paradigm for understanding how listeners recognize spoken words. Word recognition is crucial not only for comprehending spoken language but for mapping spoken words onto text in reading. Individuals with language and reading deficits (e.g., Specific Language Impairment, Dyslexia, Autism, which together affect up to 16% of children) have been shown to have deficits in word recognition, making it crucial to understand this process. A hallmark of word recognition is that listeners activate neural representations of multiple candidate words that are consistent with the early acoustic input, and these candidates compete for recognition as they unfold in real-time. Our project will develop and optimize a new method in which machine learning tools are used to decode EEG-based neural signals to characterize the time-course of competition. Such a method offers the prospect of a diagnostic tool to identify young children who are at risk for communication disorders.",Decoding the neural time-course of spoken word recognition,9831086,R21DC017596,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cognitive', 'Communication impairment', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dyslexia', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Eye Movements', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Orthography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral response', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'millisecond', 'named group', 'neurotransmission', 'oculomotor', 'phonology', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'specific language impairment', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R21,2020,152547,0.06800989755920647
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,9934294,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,543993,0.2160490847798357
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity.
