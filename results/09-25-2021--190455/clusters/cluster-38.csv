"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9643493,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,545657,0.03412314438624651
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9820438,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,157009,0.07536587797539862
"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update ‘mental models’ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A model’s complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the ‘complexity’ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to ‘overthinking’ while learning, whereas less complex models to ‘oversimplify’ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'career', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'information processing', 'insight', 'lens', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'norepinephrine system', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,0.033651830738757514
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9720954,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microphone', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,800196,0.04165464480161727
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,9724645,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2019,190538,0.029316170264970364
"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications Digital mental health technology (DMHT) –digital devices (smartphones, sensors) that can monitor and collect personal data from patients (tracking location/voice/motion, self-report), apply algorithms and machine learning (“ML”) to generate and integrate health and risk information (from genomics/family history), and even mediate care (monitoring treatment adherence or chatbot therapy)– is being integrated into mental health clinical care, with the goal of improving access, diagnostics and treatment for mental illness. DMHT poses novel ethical challenges because (1) use of DMHT disrupts traditional frameworks, such as the physician-patient dyad, for addressing ethical obligations and challenges in mental health care; (2) DMHT will contribute to the creation of novel and massive amount of behavioral data and risk categories, particularly when combined with other technologies, such as WGS, which may be difficult for clinicians and patients to evaluate and meaningfully use; and 3) behavioral health data will be created and used outside of frameworks for protecting the privacy of health data and may be experienced as surveillance by patients. The goals of the project are to: (1) examine how key stakeholders – DMHT developers, clinicians and patients – conceptualize and operationalize the ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT as it is translated into clinical care for the treatment of mood and psychotic disorders; and (2) use qualitative and quantitative methods to interview and survey clinicians, patients and consumers who use DMHT to examine the ethical, legal and social implications of the technology, particularly in relation to trust, privacy, data protection and management, and surveillance; and (3) provide improved understandings of how developers, patients, and clinicians perceive and manage ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT, that can be used as a foundation for further research and to provide guidance for ethical and safe use of digital technology in mental health care. he long-term goals of the project are to: 1) develop a research program exploring the ethical, legal and social implications of digital health technologies in mental health care and the potential impact on ethical frameworks in healthcare; 2) generate empirical research that improves understandings of the ethical, legal and social, implications of digital health technology; and 3) to improve understandings of the ethical issues involved in the use of DMHT to inform guidelines and social policy for the use of digital health technology in research, clinical, and community settings.

The goals of the project are to: (1) examine how key stakeholders – DMHT developers, clinicians and patients – conceptualize and operationalize the ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT as it is translated into clinical care; and (2) use qualitative and quantitative methods to interview and survey clinicians, patients and consumers who use DMHT to examine the ethical, legal and social implications of the technology, particularly in relation to trust, privacy, data protection and management, and surveillance; and (3) provide improved understandings of how developers, patients, and clinicians perceive and manage ethical, legal and social implications of DMHT, that can be used as a foundation for further research and to provide guidance for ethical and safe use of digital technology in mental health care.","Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications",9821661,K01MH118375,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Cultural Backgrounds', 'Data', 'Data Protection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Empirical Research', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Improve Access', 'Informed Consent', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motion', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Privacy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Scholarship', 'Social Policies', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Voice', 'age group', 'behavioral health', 'chatbot', 'clinical care', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'digital', 'ethical legal social implication', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health application', 'health data', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'mHealth', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'risk minimization', 'sensor', 'social implication', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'uptake']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,126897,0.08212713506608056
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modifiers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Specifically, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identified in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are  transparent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large benefit  (quantitative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efficiency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identified in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and  behavioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the  National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options.

"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9600712,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,734746,0.0875090008525676
"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9806002,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,179096,0.05740791946032166
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9769134,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248999,0.09566822315516571
"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9685220,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,166704,0.04757868399724433
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9774983,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2019,751223,0.026863314727329623
"Office of the Scientific Director The NIMH Division of Intramural Research Programs' (IRP) scientists conduct research ranging from studies into the mechanisms of normal brain function at the behavioral, systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Researchers study conditions in adults and children such as anxiety, depressive, bipolar, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, as well as schizophrenia. Approaches include experimental therapeutics; functional and molecular imaging; genetics; behavioral, cognitive, molecular and cellular neuroscience; and epidemiology. In part, because of its state-of-the-art facilities, unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation's capital, the IRP is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.  Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director for the NIMH IRP and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. The portfolio also includes projects aimed at exploring new technologies and approaches to neuroscience such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). The Scientific Director provides supplemental resources, as appropriate, to research projects in the IRP portfolio.  In FY2019, a new tenure-track principal investigator joined the IRP whose group will study the role of opioid and monoamine systems in regulating synaptic integration in neuronal circuits that mediate motivation and affective states. In addition, we hired a Scientific Information Officer (SIO) to provide support for big data storage and analytics. The Office of the Scientific Director (OSD) continued to support collaborative activities within NIMH and with other NIH institutes, including collaborative research projects involving three or more PIs, and several scientific workshops and seminar series, for example, workshops on topics such as real-time fMRI neurofeedback, attention and awareness, regulatory peptides, and computational modeling of the nervous system; and a seminar series on machine learning in brain imaging, neuroscience, and psychology. The OSD also continued to host the seminar series called, ""New Discoveries in Mental Health Research."" The purpose of the seminar series is to help intramural scientists to learn more about innovative extramural research that is relevant to the NIMH mission, and to build new relationships with investigators outside of the Intramural Research Program. n/a",Office of the Scientific Director,10021346,ZIAMH002917,"['Adult', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Capital', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Congresses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Institutes', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Opioid', 'Peptides', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical investigation', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'imaging genetics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'mental disorder prevention', 'molecular imaging', 'monoamine', 'neurofeedback', 'neuronal circuitry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tenure track']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2019,3925691,0.054107702776602006
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual.

"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year 30. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care.3 This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,9778280,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2019,242854,0.04389915074717991
"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9920544,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,86955,0.03987764761319261

In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9755521,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2019,740241,0.03987764761319261
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0.03601635875951826
"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9767273,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2019,83193,0.02896510026953641
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9750800,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2019,118352,0.036083598750621636
"Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies Project Summary  To address the burden of mental illness, National institute of Mental Health encourages development of computational approaches that provide novel ways to understand relationships among complex, large datasets to further the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of mental diseases. These datasets are multi- dimensional, including clinical assessments, behavioral symptoms, biological measurements such as neu- roimaging and psychophysiological data. The overall objective of this grant is to advance methodology for analyzing such data to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease, to improve the understanding of individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes, and to provide the capac- ity to handle both cross-sectional and longitudinal data.  Our proposal will leverage two civilian trauma cohorts recruited through the Grady Trauma Project and the Grady Emergency Department Study, and an external validation cohort from the Hill Center study with a similar distribution of trauma exposure. We propose to develop statistically principled, computationally efﬁ- cient statistical learning methods for addressing key challenges in analyzing these large datasets. Challenges include multi-type outcomes, high dimensional data with sparse signals and high noise levels, spatial and tem- poral dependence of neuroimaging data, and heterogeneous effects across patient population. The scientiﬁc premise of this computational psychiatry research is that analytical methods integrating information from brain, behavior, and symptoms will provide much-needed data driven platforms for improving diagnosis and prediction of PTSD and other mental disorders.  In this application, we propose: (1) to develop partial generalized tensor regression methods and partial tensor quantile regression methods that can simultaneously achieve accurate prediction of clinical outcomes and efﬁcient feature extraction from high dimensional neuroimaging biomarkers; (2) to develop tensor response quantile regression methods and global inference that can achieve comprehensive and robust understanding of the heterogeneity in high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotypes in terms of environmental factors such as trauma exposure; and (3) to develop and extend methods in Aims 1 and 2 for longitudinal multi-dimensional data that will enable prediction of future post-trauma symptom severity trajectories in terms of neuroimaging biomarkers and robustify the evaluation of the impact of psychophysiological factors on neuroimaging phe- notypes. The proposed methods will be applied to the two Grady studies to address scientiﬁc hypotheses relevant to PTSD research. We will use the Hill Center study as an independent validation cohort to evaluate the reproducibility and generalizability of the ﬁndings. User-friendly software will be developed. The proposed methodology is generally applicable to many other mental health studies with complex multi-dimensional data. Narrative We propose to develop statistical methods for analyzing large-scale and multi-dimensional data in mental health studies to more effectively extract relevant information that are predictive of disease and to help understand individual variability in clinical and neurobiological phenotypes. The applications of the proposed methods will generate new knowledge to further the understanding of the mechanism and progression of the PTSD that will lead to improved disease management strategies.","Statistical Methods for Analyzing Complex, Multi-dimensional Data from Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Mental Health Studies",9839143,R01MH118771,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child Sexual Abuse', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impact evaluation', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'burden of illness', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predict clinical outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'user friendly software', 'vector']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,614061,0.04953762861232313
"Mental Health Research Network III Practice-based research has the potential to dramatically improve the speed, efficiency, relevance, and impact of mental health clinical and services research. Realizing those gains will require a practice-based research network capable of anticipating and adapting to changes in mental health care delivery, including: • Research fully embedded in real-world practice • Alignment of research goals with priorities of patient and health system stakeholders • Large-scale data infrastructure available for rapid analysis • A culture of trust and transparency to facilitate collaborative learning and improvement We propose to expand the existing Mental Health Research Network (MHRN) to include 14 research centers embedded in health systems serving a combined population of over 25 million patients in 16 states. MHRN infrastructure will be enhanced to support a next-generation practice-based network, including: • Increased engagement of patients, health system leaders, and other stakeholders in network governance • An expanded public, open-source library of software tools and other technical resources • More formal processes for conducting feasibility pilot projects and rapid response to stakeholder queries • Expanded outreach to external stakeholders and research partners This Overall application requests support for an Administrative Core, a Methods core, and four research projects. The Administrative Core will support all network activities, including ongoing affiliated research projects, new research projects proposed in this application, and new projects developed during the coming funding cycle. An Organizational Unit will include executive leadership, governance, strategic planning, and responsibility for financial management and regulatory compliance. An Outreach and External Collaboration Unit will be responsible for stakeholder engagement and developing collaborations with new research partners. An Emerging Issues Unit will support timely responses to emerging scientific and public health questions. The Methods Core will support optimal use of existing methods across all network research and develop new methods to address high-priority public health questions.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors.

"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9735228,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,397016,0.030310189217731928

"Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis PROJECT SUMMARY Postpartum depression (PPD), a common complication of childbirth, has significant morbidity and mortality for mother and child, yet etiology is still poorly understood. PPD is a more heritable subtype of MDD, yet significant heterogeneity exists within the PPD phenotype, which may reflect differences in etiology. This study aims to disentangle the heterogeneity of PPD to understand etiology by leveraging existing data from two unique global resources, the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) and the US arm of the Postpartum Depression: Action Towards Causes and Treatment Consortium. The study aims to 1) apply modern statistical learning methods in a master training set (N=63,528) and two independent testing sets (N=31,716 and N=4,978) to identify PPD subtypes, 2) identify genetic contributors to PPD subtypes and genetic overlap with other traits, and 3) examine the extent to which PPD subtypes predict longer-term mental health prognosis. This research will support my primary career goal to become an independently funded investigator with the expertise necessary to conduct integrated epidemiologic and genomic research to understand the complex etiology of PPD. My long-term research objective is to develop comprehensive risk prediction models that can ultimately be translated into effective preventive interventions and novel individualized treatments for PPD. I have expertise is in epidemiology and perinatal health, but I need additional mentored training to conduct large- scale, integrated gene-environment analyses to understand the biological basis of PPD. The specific objectives to meet my career goal are to 1) develop skills in data science to effectively analyze large, complex datasets, 2) establish an in-depth understanding of genomics and statistical genetics, and 3) understand the complex phenotypes of PPD and other related psychiatric conditions. The core mentorship team consists of Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, lead mentor, an internationally recognized expert in perinatal mental health research, and Dr. Patrick Sullivan, co-lead mentor, a psychiatric geneticist who has built a collaborative network of depression research in Scandinavia. Dr. Yun Li, co-mentor, has extensive experience in developing statistical and computational methods for genomic and high-dimensional data. Dr. Ted Reichborn-Kjennerud, co-mentor, and Drs. Helga Ask and Alexandra Havdahl, collaborators, have extensive experience with assessment of psychiatric outcomes in the MoBa cohort. Dr. Cathryn Lewis, collaborator, is a leading expert in the development of genetic risk score methodology. Their combined mentorship will place me in an ideal position to succeed as an independent investigator. This work will inform further investigation of unique contributions of genes and environment to develop multifactorial predictive models for PPD, representing an important step towards personalized medicine in perinatal mental health. The vital skills I attain during this grant award will provide a foundation for future research evaluating interventions for prevention and personalized therapeutic treatments of PPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE PPD is a common complication of childbirth with substantial morbidity, mortality, and personal and societal costs. Identifying subtypes of PPD (Aim 1), their genetic overlap with other psychiatric disorders and traits (Aim 2), and examining how they predict longer-term mental health prognosis (Aim 3) will make a significant contribution to understanding the biological underpinnings of PPD and determining potential points of intervention. Disentangling the heterogeneity of PPD and developing sophisticated risk prediction models that integrate genetic and epidemiologic risk factors could ultimately assist in early detection, differential diagnosis, and development of personalized intervention and treatment options for these devastating disorders.",Disentangling the Epidemiologic and Genetic Heterogeneity of Postpartum Depression to Predict Risk and Prognosis,9805582,K01MH120352,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Childbirth', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Estrogens', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Norway', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Depression', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Progesterone', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scandinavia', 'Severities', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'arm', 'biopsychosocial', 'career', 'chronic depression', 'cohort', 'early life adversity', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'perinatal health', 'perinatal mental health', 'perinatal period', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'reproductive', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'societal costs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'stressor', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2019,150200,-0.003372568835887893
"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9655382,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2019,651137,0.05051283356188445
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population.

"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders.

"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9515970,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,802874,0.04165464480161727
"Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies. Project Summary:  Mental disorders represent immense healthcare burdens. Intense efforts and resources have been devoted to developing pharmacological and behavioral treatments for mental disorders, but no universally effective treatments are available. Considerable heterogeneity exists in treatment response among individuals with mental disorders, in part because an individual patient's psychosocial characteristics and/or biomarkers are not accounted for when selecting among available treatment options. Barriers to implement personalized treatments in clinical psychiatry include a lack of evidence-based, clinically interpretable, individualized treatment rules (ITRs), a lack of power to detect treatment modiﬁers from a single study, and a lack of reproducibility for treatment rules estimated from single studies. We propose analytic solutions to tackle these barriers. Speciﬁcally, we will provide integrative machine learning methods to build powerful, yet interpretable, individualized treatment strategies that can be easily applied in clinical practice. We will integrate evidence of ITRs identiﬁed in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to increase robustness and reproducibility. In Aim 1, we will provide piece-wise linear decision trees that are trans- parent, interpretable, and that have guaranteed performance. Our decision trees will simultaneously identify the optimal treatment for a given patient (qualitative interaction) and subgroups of patients with large beneﬁt (quan- titative interaction). In Aim 2, we propose a novel integrative analysis to synthesize evidence across trials and provide an integrative ITR that improves efﬁciency and reproducibility. Our method does not require all studies to collect common sets of variables and thus allows evidence to be combined from ITRs identiﬁed in recent RCTs that collected emerging biomarkers (e.g., neuroimaging measures) with earlier RCTs that focused on clinical and be- havioral markers. In response to the National Institute of Mental Health Strategic Plan on Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) to center mental health research around “dimensional psychological constructs” shared across disorders, the methods will be applied to a wide range of RCTs that recruited patients with major depressive disorder and other co-morbid mental disorders. This strategy allows examination of ITRs for constructs shared across disorders and will increase generalizability. We will apply our methods to various RCTs, including data available from the Na- tional Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness. This research will bridge approaches for personalized medicine and integrative analysis in an effort to better understand the complex interplay between biomarkers and clinical manifestations in the context of selecting the best treatments for patients with mental disorders. Project Narrative:  Treatment responses for mental disorders are inadequate and considerable heterogeneity is observed, in part because an individual patient's clinical, psychosocial, and/or biological markers are not accounted for when select- ing treatments among available options. This research proposes novel analytic methods to discover new powerful, yet interpretable personalized treatment strategies and integrate evidence of strategies identiﬁed in multiple prior studies to increase robustness and reproducibility.",Integrative Learning to Combine Evidence for Personalized Treatment Strategies.,9581848,R21MH117458,"['Age', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bulimia', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Psychiatry', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'analytical method', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical practice', 'demographics', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'mental health center', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized medicine', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2018,202500,0.028581751949774997
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9472495,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2018,698805,0.0875090008525676
"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9645863,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2018,430000,0.03087457344645203
"Office of the Scientific Director The NIMH Division of Intramural Research Programs' (IRP) scientists conduct research ranging from studies into the mechanisms of normal brain function at the behavioral, systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Researchers study conditions in adults and children such as anxiety, depressive, bipolar, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, as well as schizophrenia.  Approaches include experimental therapeutics; functional and molecular imaging; genetics; behavioral, cognitive, molecular and cellular neuroscience; and epidemiology. In part, because of its state-of-the-art facilities, unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation's capital, the IRP is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.  Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director for the NIMH IRP and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. The portfolio also includes projects aimed at exploring new technologies and approaches to neuroscience such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG).  The Scientific Director provides supplemental resources, as appropriate, to research projects in the IRP portfolio.  In FY2018, a Machine Learning Team was established within the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) core facility.  Additionally, an Assistant Clinical Investigator (ACI) joined the NIMH IRP to continue studies of brain-based mechanisms underlying severe irritability in youth, with the goal of guiding development of novel treatments. The Office of the Scientific Director (OSD) continued to support collaborative activities within NIMH and with other NIH institutes, including collaborative research projects involving three or more PIs, and several scientific workshops and seminar series. The OSD also continued to host the seminar series called, ""New Discoveries in Mental Health Research."" The purpose of the seminar series is to help intramural scientists to learn more about innovative extramural research that is relevant to the NIMH mission, and to build new relationships with investigators outside of the Intramural Research Program. n/a",Office of the Scientific Director,9797548,ZIAMH002917,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Capital', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Core Facility', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethics', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Institutes', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical investigation', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'imaging genetics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'mental disorder prevention', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2018,3970691,0.055899941399213955

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9577994,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2018,755313,0.03987764761319261
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9505590,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,163291,0.04757868399724433
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values.

"Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression Project Summary/Abstract Depression is the most common complication of pregnancy and affects 10-20% of women. Up to 75% of women with perinatal depression do not receive mental health care. In lower income African American and Hispanic women, the prevalence of perinatal depression (PND) is particularly high and the treatment rates are lower. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment but practical barriers such as time commitment, insurance coverage, and transportation, as well as stigma, limit uptake of CBT particularly for minority women. Similarly, concern about the adverse effects of antidepressant treatment on maternal and infant outcomes limits uptake of pharmacological treatments. A novel avenue for the development of safe therapeutics for depression focuses on the brain-gut axis and is supported by initial demonstrations that probiotics can improve mood symptoms. Our long-term goal is to assist in the discovery of potential microbes that are correlated with PND, and could be novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, particularly in minority women. As a first step, we propose a multi-PI feasibility study involving the implementation and optimization of processes for participant recruitment and stool sample collection, as well as the initial assessments of longitudinal differences in gut microbiota between pregnant women with and without major depressive disorder (MDD). To meet these goals, we will leverage an established research infrastructure to conduct a prospective, nested case-control study. We will prospectively collect depression diagnoses and gut microbiome samples on 300 women at four points during pregnancy and after delivery to yield a total of 58 women, 29 cases with MDD and 29 controls without MDD. The two groups will be matched on key covariates (e.g., age, race, socio- economic status, gestational age, health). At their scheduled usual care, prenatal appointment, consented participants will complete mental health, demographics, microbiome-related, and dietary and physical habits questionnaires and provide a fecal sample either at that time of their appointment or at home. To achieve our first aim - to determine the feasibility of a larger similarly designed study - we will estimate the total number of potential participants, the number assessed and not assessed for eligibility (and reasons), the number excluded and reasons for exclusion, the number lost to follow-up, and the data available for analysis at each of the 4 visits. To achieve our second aim - to determine whether the gut microbiome dynamically differs in pregnant women with and without MDD - we will employ a suite of systems level approaches, including multivariate statistical techniques, network modeling and machine learning techniques. This R03 will allow us to optimize our research processes for the prospective collection of stool samples and mental health data in preparation for larger nested case-control studies, and ultimately clinical trials of probiotic therapies for PND. Project Narrative Up to 75% of women diagnosed with depression during pregnancy and the postpartum receive inadequate treatment, in large part due to concerns about the safety of antidepressants. Here we propose a feasibility study in preparation for a larger study to determine whether women with depression during their pregnancy and after their delivery have alterations in the bacterial communities in their intestine. Identifying which bacteria are associated with depression is a critical first step in the development of safe probiotic treatments for depression during pregnancy. !",Human Microbiome and Perinatal Depression,9507031,R03HD095056,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Appointment', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Endocrine system', 'Epidemiology', 'Exclusion', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feces', 'Germ-Free', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nutritional', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prenatal care', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'antepartum depression', 'antidepressant effect', 'bacterial community', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'drug development', 'dysbiosis', 'effective therapy', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal transplantation', 'follow-up', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'health data', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'maternal stress', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microorganism', 'mood symptom', 'network models', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'nutrition', 'perinatal mental health', 'peripartum depression', 'probiotic therapy', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample collection', 'social stigma', 'stool sample', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2018,92360,0.02896510026953641
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,0.036083598750621636
"Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth ABSTRACT Only slightly more than half (55%) of 4-17 year olds with significant mental health difficulties receive treatment. These are often not initiated until issues are significantly impacting the child and family. Nearly half of children with known mental health disorders and up to 80% of children with sub-clinical symptoms receive no treatment. This study aims to (a) develop methods based on electronic medical records data to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age and (b) conduct a pragmatic randomized trial in two non-academic health care systems to test a mental health family navigator model to promote early access to, engagement in, and coordination of needed mental health services for children and adolescence. Phase 1 of the study would focus on the development and refinement of a natural language processing (NLP) tool to identify symptomatic 4-17 year olds with no diagnosed mental health disorder(s). The tool would identify patients with documentation of mental health symptoms or complaints in the free text of a progress note from a recent primary care or urgent care visit. Phase 2 of the study would focus on conducting a pragmatic randomized trial comparing intervention and usual care arm patients enrolled from Kaiser Permanente (KP) Washington and KP Northern California. The trial will enroll 200 patients per arm (n=400). The navigator model to be implemented and tested will include three groups based on recent visits recorded in the electronic health record. Those with: (1) a new mental health diagnosis; (2) new mental health medication ordered, no mental health diagnosis; (3) no new mental health diagnosis or medication (symptoms identified by NLP tool). The study intervention will offer 6 months of support to the family by a mental health navigator (social worker). The navigator will perform an initial needs and barriers assessment with the family around mental health services, conduct ongoing motivational interviewing around mental health care, provide up to 4 bridging psychotherapy sessions (when appropriate) via clinic-to-home video visits, help the family find and schedule with appropriate mental health providers in the community, reach out ad hoc if mental health appointments or medication refills are missed, stay in contact with the family for 6 months. The primary outcome is percentage of youth with at least 4 psychotherapy visits in the 6 months following the initial visit. The secondary outcome is the percentage of youth with >=80% medication adherence over the 6 month follow up period. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have higher rates of psychotherapy use and medication adherence compared to the control arm. We will also assess medication adjustments, initiation of psychotherapy or medications, and (intervention arm only) change in self-efficacy in navigating the mental health care system over 6 months. All primary analyses will follow an intent-to-treat approach. A waiver of consent will be obtained to include data for all individuals offered the intervention in the analysis, regardless of the amount of intervention (“dose” of navigation) received. NARRATIVE Mental illnesses often first appear in childhood and adolescence yet go mostly untreated until a serious disorder develops. This study will (a) develop ways to identify early mental health needs in children 4-17 years of age using free text notes entered into medical records, and (b) carry out a two-arm randomized trial to test if offering social worker support and video-based psychotherapy result in more mental health visits over a 6 month period of time.",Assisted Identification and Navigation of Early Mental Health Symptoms in Youth,9752077,R56MH117767,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Appointment', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Family', 'Family health status', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Medical Records', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Self Efficacy', 'Social Workers', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Videoconferencing', 'Visit', 'Wait Time', 'Washington', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'burden of illness', 'care providers', 'child mental health service', 'electronic registry', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'pragmatic trial', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment services', 'trial comparing', 'trial design', 'urgent care', 'usual care arm', 'waiver']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R56,2018,741297,0.1359740567684339

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,0.038305324021592924
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9547265,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,395830,0.030310189217731928
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years. Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases and Anorexia Nervosa is two to three times more deadly than schizophrenia, bipolar and major depressive disorder. The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NeuroMAP) aims to provide a (a) scientific, (b) operational, and (c) educational infrastructure for innovative neuroscience-based research to use individual differences on several biological levels together with sophisticated statistical approaches to generate clinically meaningful predictions of risk and outcomes for mood, anxiety, and eating disorders. The Laureate Institute for Brain Research (LIBR) in Tulsa, OK, is ideally placed to provide this infrastructure because: (a) LIBR has recruited young investigators with an impressive track record of scientific productivity, (b) LIBR is situated adjacent to the Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital (LPCH), one of the Midwest's largest psychiatric facilities that provides LIBR with a pipeline for patient recruitment, and (c) LIBR closely collaborates with the University of Tulsa (TU) on computational statistics and University of Oklahoma, Tulsa (OU) on bioassay research. The Specific Aims of NeuroMAP are: (1) To provide a state of the art neuroimaging and laboratory infrastructure to conduct biological experiments with multi-level assessments using core facilities; (2) To provide a mentoring infrastructure to a group of young investigators to conduct studies that identify predictive biological markers and processes for patients with mood or anxiety disorders; (3) To create a career development infrastructure to accelerate the investigator's transition from young investigator to established investigator; (4) To build an operational infrastructure that provides the tools necessary to conduct the research projects, standardize assessments and provide a data repository for future pilot projects. NeuroMAP will consists of: (a) an Administrative Core (Paulus): to establish the infrastructure necessary to expand the research efforts of the young investigators; (b) Research Core (Bodurka, Teague, McKinney): to provide the technical expertise to utilize multi-level approaches (from cell markers to symptoms) to quantify individual differences and generate outcome predictions.

"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9474211,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2018,654472,0.05051283356188445
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population. This research proposes novel evaluation and implementation concepts and methods that aim to extend our capacity to adopt these technologies in an evidence-based manner.",Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression,9412888,R01MH109496,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Inferior', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'burden of illness', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'cognitive computing', 'computer science', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'dissemination research', 'efficacy study', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'functional status', 'high dimensionality', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'preference', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research data dissemination', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'statistics', 'technology development']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,396101,0.016580399643651697
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9314333,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,593935,0.050843632223114554
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression.

We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP- powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence).

"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9379995,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,822645,0.04165464480161727
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9357585,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,300665,-0.013399737426190446
"UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. These tools help clarify the genetic cause of mental diseases, characterize individual disease risks and develop individualized treatment strategies.            ",UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONAL IMPACTS OF GENETIC VARIANTS IN MENTAL DISORDERS,9389287,R01MH108728,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Annotation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Reporting', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,381539,0.03087457344645203
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9385505,K99MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2017,110318,0.09566822315516571
"MHealth Monitoring of Acoustic and Behavioral Patterns in Bipolar Disorder Across Cultures Abstract: The ability to prioritize individuals for health care based on behavioral and acoustic patterns in speech will allow for efficient use of health care resources. The ability to predict mood states using daily monitoring of acoustics derived from mobile technology provides the basis for a real-time proxy measure of moods and affective states. Identification and monitoring of these and other dimensional features of human disease is the base for anticipating outcomes, offering the future possibility of timely and mitigating interventions. Technological and mHealth methods are well suited for the global health community due to the flexibility and adaptability of the approach; the capacity to reach large numbers of patients can be easily amplified with modest increase in infrastructure. We have developed an accurate prediction model for mood states in bipolar (BP) individuals using machine-learning strategies and established a process that involves preprocessing, feature extraction, and an integrated data analysis of clinical and acoustic data gathered from personal use of a mobile device for up to one year. The results show mood states are predicted with an AUC statistic of 0.74 (mania) and 0.77 (depression). We hypothesize that analyses across cultures will identify common features of illness that can be identified using our methods. BP is ideal for study because of the wide range of mood states and temperamental traits. This study aims to 1) ascertain 30 individuals with BP and 10 healthy controls from Lebanon and a multilingual community in SE Michigan, recording daily acoustic and behavioral data using a smart-phone, all outgoing speech from the device is gathered and all personal digital activity is recorded from the device. We propose to study participants in Lebanon and SE Michigan in order to identify the fundamental acoustic elements of mood variation among bipolar patients. 2) apply integrated computational analyses using static (Gaussian Mixture Models and Support Vector Machines) and dynamic (Hidden Markov Models) modeling of categorical, dimensional and derived features from clinical, acoustic, and behavioral signals; we will compare data from the 15 BP from Lebanon and 15 BP from SE Michigan that have been resident in USA >2 years but originate from a geographical region comparable to Lebanon in language and culture, and 15 American born BP Caucasians (from our current cohort). Our hypothesis is that there are fundamental elements of acoustics that associate with mood states regardless of the culture. The impact is the longitudinal use of mobile technology to passively gather personal data to establish computational models that use extensive individual state and trait data to accurately predict mood and health states. This provides a foundation for predictive modeling that can be integrated into subsequent clinical interventional studies to predict and test causal effects of specific interventions on disease mechanisms. Expertise in clinical, computational, and technology disciplines form the team to realize these goals. This is a study that focuses on the ability of technological methods to detect speech and behavioral patterns in patients with bipolar disorder across cultural boundaries to identify common features that predict mood states.

"Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records ABSTRACT This Career Development Application describes targeted coursework and mentored research for progression to independent research in the use of electronic health record data for disease subtyping. Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Use of natural language processing techniques has enabled computational analysis of specific terms found in free text clinical notes. An improved ability to extract symptom information from clinical notes would improve researchers’ ability to use de-identified data from patient records for discovery of disease subtypes. Symptom-related terms are particularly important in the context of mental health, but also harder to detect in notes than other terms like diseases or drug names.  The research aims of this proposal present a novel approach to scalable extension of biomedical terminologies and improved detection of those terms and their modifiers (e.g. severe, familial, absent). The richer dataset that can be extracted using these enhanced approaches is then used to define patient cohorts and to detect disease subtypes and predictors of response to specific pharmaceutical intervention.  Resulting patient stratification will be compared to groupings made without the enriched data and validated on an independent data set. The overarching hypothesis of this work is that enhanced mining of clinical notes will enable statistically significant and clinically relevant symptom-based stratification of psychiatric disorders. In order to test this hypothesis, I will: Aim 1: Develop a semi-automated pipeline for domain-specific terminology extension Aim 2: Define and stratify patient cohorts through use of enhanced term extraction Aim 3: Evaluate the validity and utility of the richer set of data obtained through Aims 1 and 2  One area of greatest need for more evidence-based disease stratification, and also of greatest challenge for a number of reasons, is that of mental health. Mental health disorders account for 30% of non-fatal disease burden world-wide, and pose an economic burden of trillions of dollars and climbing. Moreover, mental health symptoms are generally subjective and self-reported, with few objectively measurable signs. The impact of this proposal is that it will dramatically improve our ability to use EHR data to stratify patients in this drastically underserved area of health and healthcare.  The major innovations of this project are the adaptation and application of a semi-supervised pattern learning pipeline to augment mental health terminologies, and a novel approach to disease stratification using a significantly underutilized source of biomedical data, namely clinical notes.  This work addresses a major challenge for mining clinical notes in rapidly evolving biomedical domains and leverages a valuable source of medical evidence that is largely untapped and underutilized. Together, these methods for enhanced use of clinical notes will enable identification of distinct patient subgroups using data that is sitting idle in EHRs. Project Narrative Electronic health records have demonstrated great promise as a scalable source of data for biomedical research to enable “precision medicine.” Natural language processing has enabled the use of information from clinical notes in addition to structured data like diagnoses and lab values. This work aims to improve our ability to extract useful information from electronic health records to enable disease subtyping, particularly in the area of mental health.",Improved Disease Stratification Using Electronic Health Records,9453180,K01LM012529,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease stratification', 'Economic Burden', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatology', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'response', 'treatment response']",NLM,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,189054,0.012648840779167309
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,0.036083598750621636
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,9278303,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'novel therapeutics', 'population health', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,176472,0.10118363149958454
"Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health Abstract: HealthRhythms, Inc. Substantial evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of psychiatric symptoms and full blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to add the layer of mental health care to all of healthcare. Our product model capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of mental health on a 24/7 basis captured in the user’s natural environment, opposed to the sporadic, in-clinic measurement that has characterized mental healthcare to date. The product we envision will ultimately have three pillars: Rhythm Sensing, Rhythm Trending, and Rhythm Stabilization. The first two of these pillars have been developed and thousands of licenses for our product have already been sold. Building on our accomplishments to date, this SBIR Phase II Direct proposal extends our work in three ways: 1) further validating our existing technology, 2) developing the next stage of our technology and 3) expanding and improving our prediction models and demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our technology. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Enhance our Rhythm Trending capabilities through intensive examination and analysis of data from the 3,000+ patients with whom our product has already been deployed. Aim 2: Develop the envisioned Rhythm Stabilization pillar of our technology. Aim 3: Expand the nature of the data included in our prediction models and demonstrate their utility.  Project Narrative HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral health rhythms in order to provide automated intervention advice to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this Direct Level II SBIR application, will enable HealthRhythms to be certain that 1) we are using all the power of the smartphone to get the measurement of behavioral health exactly right and 2) we can use those measurements to help individuals with depression or anxiety make changes in their behavior that are right for them and, thereby, reduce their symptoms and keep those symptoms from coming back.",Monitoring and Stabilizing Behavioral Rhythms to Improve Mental Health,9346502,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral health', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'convict', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'sensor', 'social', 'social media', 'trend']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2017,964251,0.10975555044076238
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.

"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9368213,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,397661,0.030310189217731928
"The Center for Neuroscience-based Mental Health Assessment and Prediction (NEUROMAP) Project Summary Mood and anxiety disorders will account for approximately $16 x 109 lost productivity or 25% of global GDP over the next 20 years.

"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9293065,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2017,667956,0.05051283356188445
"Novel Methods for Evaluation and Implementation of Behavioral Intervention Technologies for Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major depressive disorder (MDD) is projected to be a leading cause of burden of disease globally and in the United States. In the United States, in 2012 alone, an estimated 16 million adults aged 18 or older (7% of all adults) had at least one major depressive episode. While psychological treatments are effective at treating depression, the high prevalence of MDD makes it impossible to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) use technologies such as mobile phones to support behavior change to improve mental health, and have been shown to have similar effects to psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. With the growing number of mobile phone users, BIT is a viable and promising option for delivering psychotherapy. On the other hand, the current evaluation framework of new interventions is not adequate for evaluating and implementing BITs, because of the rapidly evolving BIT landscape and the complexity of the interventions. This research aims to develop and validate novel concepts and evaluation framework to address these two challenges in the dissemination and implementation of BITs in MDD patients in pragmatic settings. We plan to achieve this research goal in four steps. First, we will develop a new statistical design, called open-ended adaptive randomization (OAR) procedure, which will enable us to continuously evaluate BITs that enter and leave a care delivery system. The OAR also aims to improve quality of care given to the participating patients, by sequentially allocating patients away from inferior BITs based on the interim evidence during deployment. Second, we will develop a data analytical technique, called regularized Q-learning, which will enable us to perform variable selection in high-dimensional settings and retain only the important predictors of health outcomes in the learning model. While the original Q-learning is a cutting-edge technique originating from the computer science literature, the research will extend its capability to handle high-dimensional data and enrich the learning model by incorporating regularized regression. Third, we will prepare for the next implementation phase of the proposed methods, by calibrating the methods with computer simulations, creating an initial knowledge base by analyzing data from current randomized clinical trials, identifying partnerships with healthcare providers and app curation plaftorms. Fourth, we will advocate for the general implementation of the proposed methods by producing publications, building cognitive computing systems, and tracking the source of citation and adoption of the published results by the broader health research community. Our long-term goal is to enhance our capability of deploying complex interventions such as BITs to depressed patients in a personalized and evidence-based manner throughout the healthcare system. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, and imposes a high societal cost in terms of quality of life, work productivity, functional status, morbidity and mortality. The national healthcare system will not be able to meet the needs in the population with standard one-to-one intensive psychological treatments. With the growing number of smartphone use, behavioral intervention technologies have become a viable and scalable option to deliver psychotherapy to the population.

"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),9109063,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Android', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,580914,0.050843632223114554
"Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). Despite decades of research and development for the treatment of mood disorders, depression has risen from the 5th leading cause of disability to the leading cause in the US. Critical barriers for progress in the field are 1) Poor access to high quality care for consumers; 2) Limited mental health workforce; and 3) Few providers are trained in the delivery of evidence-based treatments. In response to this public health problem, our team is proposing to use a mobile platform to improve access to an evidence based treatment; increase the reach of mental health coaches while supporting the delivery of higher quality of care. We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). By improving the efficiency and competence of mental health coaches in the context of mobile mental health services, we expect patients to make greater gains in depression, mood-related disability, and in achieving personal goals. In order to evaluate the feasibility, tolerability, and overall impact of the enhancements to PRIME, we will spend Year 1 engaging stakeholders in a human centered iterative design process and spend Years 2-3 conducting a pilot randomized controlled trial in which we will randomize 120 individuals with depression to either receive 8- weeks of 1) PRIME 1.0 (current version) OR 2) PRIME 2.0 (version with the NLP-powered clinician dashboard). Using BRIGHTEN, our mobile clinical trial platform, we will recruit participants, consent, screen, evaluate and deliver the intervention entirely remotely. The pilot data from this study will be used to prepare for a R01 study to definitively determine whether PRIME may be used to efficiently and effectively improve outcomes for a significantly larger number of individuals with depression. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational Enhancement (PRIME). We will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP- powered messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment (competence). If successful, PRIME could operate as a cost effective tool for clinicians to extend their reach and an accessible treatment for the population of those struggling with depression.",Scaling a smarter and more efficient intervention: Evaluating the feasibility of disseminating a novel mobile app platform to treat depression,9165454,R34MH110583,"['Behavioral', 'Case Mixes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'arm', 'base', 'blind', 'care seeking', 'cost effective', 'dashboard', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'motivational intervention', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'research and development', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'targeted treatment', 'technological innovation', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R34,2016,320685,0.10101446666237483
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,9119612,R01MH103148,"['Accelerometer', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relapse patients', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,388305,0.03857325595185524
"Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from mobile phones and other wearable sensors will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes. Computers will analyze individual-level data streams to permit unprecedented, individual-level precision in research and intervention. This type of precision medicine enables targeting of science and medicine to a particular individual's genetic makeup, past and current situation, and behavioral health exposures. Mobile phones, smartwatches, and common fitness devices are already capable of generating rich data on behavior, but developing algorithms to interpret that raw data using the latest machine learning algorithms requires practical strategies to annotate large datasets. We propose to develop and test the feasibility and usability of a mobile and online crowdsource-based system for cleaning and annotating behavioral data collected from motion sensors, mobile phones, and other mobile devices. Our goal is to demonstrate how individuals playing mobile and online games - the ""crowd"" - can collectively, affordably, and incrementally clean and add important metadata to raw sensor data that has been passively collected from individuals, similar to that from population-scale surveillance studies (e.g., the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and UK Biobank) and those planned for studies such as the White House's Precision Medicine Initiative. The game-playing crowd will thereby dramatically improve the utility of the datasets collected for a variety of scientific studies. We will validate our prototye system on datasets collected from motion monitors used to study physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, but we will demonstrate how the system could be extended for use on the increasingly rich datasets that are being collected with mobile devices and that include not only motion data, but also sensor data on location, light, audio, and person-to-person proximity. We will then refine the system, foster a community of crowd game players interested in citizen science, and release the source code to the system as an open source project so that other researchers can adapt the technique for their own work.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Longitudinal sensor data collected passively from wearable activity monitors and mobile phones will transform behavioral science by allowing researchers to use ""big data,"" but at the person-level, to understand how behavior and related environmental exposures impact health outcomes and personalize health intervention and research. We propose to develop and test a system that permits typical mobile application game players to help scientists improve this type of data, by adding additional annotations that enrich the data, making it more useful for behavioral science and more amenable to automatic processing. This will help researchers to better understand how individual-level behaviors relate to health outcomes in current research studies that collect personal-level sensor data such as NHANES and the Women's Health Study, and future big data ventures such as the new Precision Medicine Initiative.        ",Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health,9078547,UH2EB024407,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Source Code', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'biobank', 'citizen science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'fitness', 'genetic makeup', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning network', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'surveillance study', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'ubiquitous computing', 'usability']",NIBIB,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,299438,-0.013399737426190446
"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,9039666,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'online community', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,192605,0.02428031510375454
"Understanding the functional impacts of genetic variants in mental disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the US, 46% are afflicted with a mental illness at some point of life. The management and treatment of mental disorders pose significant economical and social burden to the society. Many rare and common genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs, are reported to be associated with mental disorders, yet more remain to be discovered. However, despite the large amount of high-throughput genomics data, there is a lack of integrative methods to systematically prioritize variants that confer susceptibility to mental disorders; additionally, despite the presence of many candidate variants for mental disorders, their disease-contributory mechanism remains elusive, so appropriate functional follow-up experiments cannot be designed. Altogether, these problems resulted in a large gap between the copious amount of data about genetic variation and our understanding of their functional impacts on mental diseases, which ultimately delays the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. To address these problems, we propose to develop a suite of novel bioinformatics approaches: (1) NeuroComplex, an information integration approach that leverages phenotype information and multiple sources of prior biological knowledge to rank genes by their likelihood of contributing to specific phenotypic presentations. (2) integrated MEntal-disorder GEnome Score (iMEGES), which leverages a two-layer strategy to predict the impacts of variants in personal genomes on mental disorders. The first layer uses machine learning algorithm to build variant deleteriousness scores for coding, non-coding and structural variants; the second layer integrates variant scores and NeuroComplex to assign pathogenicity scores. (3) a hierarchical model called CombOmics that incorporates cross-omics information to characterizes how variants confers disease risk, in order to help formulate hypothesis of pathogenicity and facilitate the design of functional follow-up experiments. (4) we will develop user-friendly software tools and web applications that implement all the aforementioned bioinformatics approaches, and continuously release and maintain these tools to ensure the maximum benefits to the scientific community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will develop novel informatics approaches to understand how genetic variation impacts various mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism.

"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",9132357,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'study characteristics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2016,172209,0.058567981106477374
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness.

"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall.

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9049546,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'concept mapping', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'data access', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health service use', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medication compliance', 'mobile computing', 'monitoring device', 'mood symptom', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'reduce symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,564995,0.14375747485549653
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8892259,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,613425,0.050843632223114554
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8892263,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychotic symptoms', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,413392,0.03857325595185524

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): People facing serious health threats increasingly use the Internet to obtain information and support. Internet support groups (ISGs), online communities where people come together to exchange information and/or support, are an important resource for patients grappling with serious medical conditions. Participation in health-related ISGs has been associated with significant reductions in participant-reported depression, anxiety and other indicators of psychological distress. These groups offer great potential for interventions that are highly scalable and yet easily tailored to individual needs. Unfortunately many ISG members leave too soon to benefit. In addition, there is limited scientific understanding of the active ingredients underlying the benefits that ISGs confer among their members. The proposed research uses state-of-the art machine learning and automated language analysis techniques to assess the types of interactions in online health support groups that lead to improved psychosocial well-being and health-related quality of life and how these interactions develop. It also uses these technologies and insight from our empirical research to build, deploy, and evaluate interventions that improve the interactions in health-related Internet support groups. Our work has three major aims. In Aims 1 and 2, we will analyze data from two complementary Internet support groups to identify (a) the communication processes that sustain participant engagement in the group and (b) the communication processes through which peer-to-peer interactions improve participants' psychosocial outcomes. These datasets come from an ongoing naturalistic study of 4,400 cancer survivors and caregivers in ISGs hosted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and from a soon-to-be-completed NIMH-funded randomized trial (MH093501) assessing the effectiveness of an ISG for depressed and anxious patients referred to the group by their primary care physicians. Both datasets include participant-level data on depression, anxiety, stress and other psychosocial outcomes and detailed server logs containing information on page views, time on site, and the content of communications between participants. In Aim 3, we will develop and pilot test interventions to encourage the communication processes identified as effective in Aims 1 and 2. We will test whether mood, satisfaction with interactions and engagement in the group increase following interventions that (a) increase participants' receipt of individualized support from others; (b) provide participants with opportunities to offer support to others; (c) facilitate participants' expression of emotions; and (d) help participants form relationships with similar peers. In a series of randomized experiments, we will examine how these interventions affect participants' communication behaviors as well as short-term engagement and satisfaction with their online interactions. Results from this project will facilitate the development of an R01 application for a randomized clinical trial testing the impact of personalized ISG interventions on the length of time participants continue to participate in ISGs and participants' depression, anxiety and other psychosocial outcomes as well as healthcare utilization.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will examine how social exchanges among members of online health support groups lead to improvements in participants' health-related quality of life. Our findings will clarify the mechanisms through which social support leads to improved health-related quality of life and the process by which support resources are produced. The automated techniques we use to measure the exchange of support resources will also be the basis for interventions designed to make these exchanges more efficient and effective by matching people seeking support with those who can offer the type of support they need.            ",Internet Support Groups: Isolating and Improving Pathways Towards Mental Health,8873740,R21MH106880,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caregivers', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empirical Research', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Social support', 'Stress', 'Support Groups', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'communication behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'insight', 'language processing', 'member', 'peer', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,231129,0.02428031510375454
"A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last decade has seen explosive growth of online social networks (OSNs), which are now a pervasive part of everyday life for many people. ""Big data"" analyses of OSNs have enormous potential to enable new discoveries and applications in public health. For example we may soon be able to study how mental health indicators vary over time and between communities and regions; how major events like disasters and mass shootings affect community mental health; and potentially even use social media for individual-level screening and diagnosis. But in order to do this effectively, psychologists need to know how to make sense of vast amounts of digital records of raw behavior. That will require interdisciplinary collaborations between psychology and computer science to create new tools and methods for automated analyses of mental health variables in large and complex datasets. The goal of this project is to develop new metrics for doing large-scale, ""big data"" mental health research on Twitter, a popular online social network service with a large and diverse user base in the United States that makes most user-generated content publicly available. We are particularly interested in how Twitter data can be used to draw inferences about users' personality traits (which are indicative of risk and vulnerability), emotions, and clinical symptoms. To date, researchers studying mental health on Twitter have focused on a small number of metrics which often differ from study to study and are not always well-validated. We do not yet have a unified, comprehensive understanding of how mental health characteristics can be measured and studied online. Our project has three goals. First, we will gather data from a very large, representative sample of American Twitter users to map out what meaningful metrics can be derived from Twitter data. What can be reliably measured, and how are different kinds of metrics related to each other? By studying relationships and overlaps among these variables, we expect to identify a key set of online metrics that can be used to characterize important psychological differences among users. Second, we will recruit a sample of Twitter users to complete standardized assessments of personality, emotion, and clinical symptoms. We will look to see what kinds of online behaviors are reliable and valid markers of these psychological variables. Third, to demonstrate the utility of these markers we will monitor millions of Twitter accounts around the country for one year to measure how one specific kind of community trauma, mass shootings, affects indicators of personality, emotion, and mental health. We expect to find effects of such events on the online expression of emotion and clinical symptoms immediately following an event, and perhaps longer-term effects that endure beyond the immediate aftermath.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to identify important markers of personality, emotion, and mental health in Twitter data. This will be useful to researchers who want to use ""big data"" approaches to study mental health, and to policy applications to study individual or regional variations and reactions to events.            ","A Common Framework for ""Big Data"" Mental Health Research on Twitter",8873743,R21MH106879,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disasters', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Negative Valence', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Personality Traits', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structural Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'digital', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'member', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web-based social networking']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R21,2015,203059,0.058567981106477374
"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8857265,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2015,176472,0.10118363149958454
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8898070,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,164698,0.05272040378165181

"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8892258,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,525858,0.14375747485549653

We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,9067635,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,43567,0.14375747485549653
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8705032,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,626698,0.050843632223114554
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.

"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work. Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.

"Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am an epidemiologist and junior faculty member in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham & Women's Hospital, and Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School. My long term goal is to establish a career as an independent investigator in psychiatric pharmacoepidemiology. As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8711562,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2014,176472,0.10118363149958454
"Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Falls are a significant cause of death and serious injury and result in significant health-care costs. Individuals with a lower extremity amputation due to vascular disease are overwhelmingly elderly (at least 65 years of age) and are at especially high risk of falling. Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180608,0.05272040378165181

Successful fall prevention strategies depend on understanding how, why, when, and where individuals fall, and what types of falls (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fll) are likely in a given population. Most studies on falls in amputees to date have relied surveys or questionnaires that are often completed a significant time after the fall and thus rely both on the individual's ability to remember the details of their fall and their willingness to be objective abut how and why they fell. Such approaches are susceptible both to inaccurate memories of the fall and to recall bias-for example, due to embarrassment about falling- and are especially unreliable in the elderly amputees. Mobile phones provide a simple, cost-effective method for detection and characterization of falls. Most available smart phones today have a tri-axial accelerometer, which provides highly accurate fall detection in real-time. Other available applications (or apps) can provide data on activity (running, walking etc.) and environment-such as the weather conditions or population density-that may have contributed to the fall and can pin-point the location of the fall-using GPS technology and highly accurate maps. Mobile phones also have inbuilt data storage and transfer capability, allowing for real-time acquisition and transmission of data. Additionally, mobile phones provide a simple means to contact the individual immediately after a suspected fall to confirm details of the fall (and to ascertain the need for medical assistance). Because mobile phone use is so widespread, there is no stigma associated with carrying such a device, which is likely to lead to high compliance. This study aims to use a mobile phone-based fall detection system in dysvascular amputees to detect falls, characterize the type of fall, analyze environmental conditions that may have contributed to the fall, and determine the longer-term consequences of each type of fall. Data acquired may be used to improve rehabilitation protocols or design better prostheses in order to prevent falls. This technology is ultimately transferrable to many populations with a high risk of falling-for example, the elderly, stroke survivors, or those with other musculoskeletal disorders or disabilities-leading to the design of specific fall prevention strategies for those populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful fall prevention strategies for the elderly dysvascular amputee population-including better prosthesis design and improved rehabilitation/fall prevention strategies-depend on understanding how, why, when, and where such individuals fall, and what types of fall occur (e.g., trip, slip, or lateral fall). Mobile smartphones with built-in triaxial accelerometers can accurately detect and classify falls, in addition to providing other applications (or 'apps') that can identify contributory environmental conditions (e.g., weather or traffic) or activities (e.g. walking or running) that have may contributed to the fall. Combined with server side analysis of wirelessly transmitted phone data-using machine learning techniques-mobile smartphones provide a simple, portable fall-detection system that generates real-time information on the mechanisms, contributory environmental factors, and consequences of falls in elderly amputees-or in any population at risk of falling.            ",Understanding Real-Life Falls in Amputees using Mobile Phone Technology,8738041,R01EB019406,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Amputees', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Assistance', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prosthesis', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Rain', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Side', 'Simulate', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Weather', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'disability', 'falls', 'fear of falling', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'information gathering', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'social stigma', 'trafficking', 'willingness']",NIBIB,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2014,180607,0.05272040378165181
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8698820,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cloud based', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'psychotic symptoms', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,506032,0.14375747485549653
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8665495,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mobile application', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2014,330324,0.048021442775367504
"Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary aim of this proposal is to develop and evaluate the use of state of the art machine learning approaches within a mobile intervention application for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on the development of algorithms that automatically improve and evolve based on collected data. Machine learning models can learn to detect complex, latent patterns in data and apply such knowledge to decision making in real time. The proposed intervention, called IntelliCare, will use ongoing data collected from the patient and intervention application to continuously adapt intervention content, content form, and motivational messaging to create a highly tailored and user-responsive treatment system. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs), including web-based and mobile interventions, have been developed and are increasingly being used to treat MDD. BITs are moderately effective in treating depression, particularly when guided by human coaching via email or telephone. However, lack of personalization and inability to adapt to patient needs or preferences, which results in a perceived lack of relevance, contributes to poorer adherence and outcomes. IntelliCare will be designed as a mobile application, but will be accessible via computer web browsers and tablets. The IntelliCare machine learning framework will use individual data obtained from use data (e.g., length of time using a treatment component), embedded sensors in the phone (e.g., GPS), and the user's self-reports (e.g., ""like"" and usefulness ratings of treatment components) to provide a highly tailored intervention that can learn from the patient and adapt intervention and motivational materials to the patient's preferences and state. Low intensity coaching will serve as a backstop to support adherence. This project will contain three phases.  Phase 1 will involve the development of IntelliCare and its optimization through usability testing.  Phase 2 will be a field trial of 200 users who will receive IntelliCare for 12 weeks. The field trial has two aims: first to complete usability testing and optimization of the treatment framework, and second to develop the machine learning models and algorithms. Phase 3 will subject IntelliCare to a double blind, randomized controlled trial, comparing it to MobilCare. MobilCare will be identical to IntelliCare except that it will use standard presentation and presentation, rather than machine learning, to provide treatment and motivational materials. We will recruit half the participants from primary care settings, as this is the de facto site for treatment of depression in the United States, and half through the Internet, which is the main portal to health apps. The application of adaptive machine learning analytics to a mobile intervention has the potential to create a new generation of BITs that could revolutionize the way that such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed. These innovations would have broad consequences and could be extended a broader range of BITS, including web- based interventions, and to other interventions targeting a wide range of health and mental health problems.            PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will create and evaluate IntelliCare, a mobile intervention also accessible by web browser, for depression. IntelliCare will harness modern adaptive machine learning analytics that can learn from a user's activity on the application, embedded phone sensors, and patient report to tailor intervention elements and motivational messaging to the needs and preferences of the user. This unprecedented level of tailoring could revolutionize the way such interventions are conceptualized, designed, and deployed.                   ",Artificial Intelligence in a Mobile Intervention for Depression (AIM),8496352,R01MH100482,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Australia', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Car Phone', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electronic Mail', 'Elements', 'Employee Assistance Program (Health Care)', 'Generations', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Site', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'base', 'care systems', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'motivational intervention', 'preference', 'primary care setting', 'psychologic', 'psychopharmacologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'tailored messaging', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment site', 'trial comparing', 'usability', 'web-accessible', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,636036,0.050843632223114554
"A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that is associated with staggeringly high individual and societal costs. Although the illness is typically chronic, it is not static, and the majority of people with schizophrenia vacillate between full or partial remission and episodes of symptomatic relapse. Relapses increase one's risk for major problems including homelessness, incarceration, victimization, and suicide. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia who relapse are three to four times more costly than those who do not. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and evaluate a novel paradigm for illness monitoring, detection of early warning signs, and relapse prevention in schizophrenia. Our interdisciplinary team of clinical researchers and computer scientists proposes to develop a mobile system that uses smartphone-embedded sensors (i.e. microphone, accelerometer, GPS, light sensor) coupled with computerized self-reports, to track a range of behaviors (i.e. paralinguistic aspect of speech, physical activity, location, sleep, mood, psychotic symptoms) that are relevant to relapse in schizophrenia. Using machine learning techniques, the system will leverage behavioral data and patient self-reported clinical updates to generate personalized early warning models. The models will evolve with use of the system over time, focusing on variability from one's typical behavioral patterns to calibrate a unique patient relapse signature. Treatment teams will be informed about patients' clinical status via secure website. When the mobile system ""flags"" trends that are consistent with one's relapse signature, it will trigger patient functions and provider functions (i.e. real-time notification, prompts to initiate contact, time-sensitive treatments) to help prevent progression to full psychotic relapse. In Phase 1 of the project, we will integrate multi-modal sensor, ecological momentary assessment, and machine learning technologies into a unified smartphone system that will be tested and refined in laboratory settings. In Phase 2, we will conduct field trials with individuals with schizophrenia i real-world conditions to identify and resolve technical and mechanical problems, adapt the software, and maximize system usability. In Phase 3, we will conduct a randomized 12- month trial of the monitoring and prevention system compared to treatment as usual in 150 outpatients with schizophrenia that are at high-risk for relapse. If successful, our proposed system can be rapidly made available to a population that is in dire need of more effective resources, and can serve as a template for mobile monitoring and treatment systems for a range of clinical conditions with an episodic nature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: An effective multi-modal mobile monitoring, early detection, and intervention system for schizophrenia could alter illness trajectory, mitigating the acute and long term impact of psychotic relapses on patients, their caretakers, and communities. A broadly available system could radically change when, how, and to what effect treatments are delivered, allowing for a paradigmatic shift from reactive to preemptive care for schizophrenia.                ",A New Paradigm for Illness Monitoring  and Relapse Prevention in Schizophrenia,8640521,R01MH103148,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Left', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Partial Remission', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Self Management', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Sleep', 'Social isolation', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Victimization', 'base', 'computer generated', 'computerized', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'software development', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'usability', 'web site']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2013,271188,0.03857325595185524
"Utilizing social media as a resource for mental health surveillance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Major depressive disorder is one of the most common debilitating illnesses in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Currently, nationwide mental health surveillance takes the form of large-scale telephone- based surveys. These surveys have high running costs and require teams of human telephone operators. Even the largest system, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, reaches only 0.13% of the US population. Twitter (and other microblog services) offers a rich, if terse, multilingual source of real time data for public health surveillance. Natural Language Processing (NLP) provides techniques and resources to ""unlock"" data from text. We propose using Twitter and NLP as a cost-effective and flexible approach to augmenting current telephone- based surveillance methods for population level depression monitoring.         This grant application has two major strands. First, investigating ethical issues and challenges to privacy that emerge with the use of Twitter data for public health surveillance (Aim One). Second, developing techniques and resources for real-time public health surveillance for mental illness from Twitter (Aim Two &Aim Three). Aim One seeks to investigate and codify our responsibilities as researchers towards Twitter users by engaging with those users directly. With Aim Two, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing resources - algorithms, lexicons and taxonomies - to support the identification of depression symptoms in Twitter data. For Aim Three, we will build and evaluate Natural Language Processing modules and services that use Twitter as a data source for monitoring depression levels in the community. The significance of the proposed work lies in three areas. First, our investigations - both empirical and theoretical - will explore ethical issues in the use of Twitter for public health surveillance. This work has the potential to guide future research in the area. Second, in developing and evaluating algorithms and resources for identifying depression from tweets, we are contributing foundational work to the field of NLP. Third, developing these algorithms and resources will provide the bedrock for building social media based surveillance systems which will provide a cost effective means of augmenting current mental health surveillance practice. This proposal is innovative in both its application area (microblogs have not been used before for mental health surveillance), its focus on using NLP to identify depressive symptoms for public health, and in the central role that qualitative bioethical research will play in guiding the work.              Project Narrative The proposed research focuses on using advanced Natural Language Processing methods to mine microblog data - in this case, Twitter - for mental health surveillance (specifically, depression surveillance), in order to augment current telephone-based mental health surveillance systems.

"Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifestyle interventions, while effective at reducing weight and diabetes risk, are intensive (i.e., requiring 16 or more face-to-face visits) which has prevented widespread implementation. Mobile technology may reduce intervention intensity while preserving outcomes by assisting in the delivery of behavioral strategies, but very little research has explored this. Weight loss mobile applications are proliferating in the open market; however our work and others2 show that the range of evidence-based strategies addressed by these apps is narrow, primarily including self-monitoring, prompts, goal-setting, and sometimes a social network.3 A key strategy missing across apps in both the market and research is problem solving, an essential component of behavioral weight loss interventions.4 We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly, an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize tha Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone, with biggest differences observable after face-to- face visits end. Using a ""crowd-sourcing"" model, we will populate a database with problems and solutions via 1) expert-delivered problem solving sessions with a sample of obese participants trying to lose weight and 2) a pre-pilot test of the app. Using principles of ""artificial intelligence"" we will convert the algorithm of problem solving counseling into the mobile application so that it may perform this strategy on its own, but based on expert and crowd-sourced information. We will then use a series of iterative steps involving qualitative research methods (usability testing, focus groups, and pre-piloting) to refine the tool A randomized pilot feasibility trial will test the feasibility and initial effects of the Smart Coah mobile application when paired with a shortened (8- week) behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a shortened behavioral weight intervention alone. Feasibility outcomes include frequency and duration of usage of the mobile app and each feature, recruitment, and retention. We will also do exploratory analyses comparing conditions on problem solving skills and weight loss at 8- and 16-weeks. Data will support a larger efficacy trial of a Smart Coach-assisted brief behavioral weight loss intervention relative to a brief behavioral weight loss intervention alone. Our overarching goal is to develop mobile technology that reduces the intensity of lifestyle interventions as far as possible while preserving weight loss outcomes, to ultimately broaden the reach to people and settings that currently have little access.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mobile technology that effectively delivers behavioral strategies to reduce the intensity of weight loss intervention while also preserving outcomes is needed to increase the impact and reach of behavioral weight loss interventions. A key strategy missing across mobile applications developed in both the market and research is problem solving, an active ingredient and central feature of behavioral weight loss interventions. We propose to develop and test the feasibility of Smart Coach, a weight loss mobile application that includes common features such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and a social network, but even more importantly an avatar-facilitated, idiographic problem solving feature that processes information intelligently to help patients identify solutions to their weight loss problems. We hypothesize that Smart Coach when combined with a lower intensity (half the sessions as the standard program) weight loss intervention will be more effective than a lower intensity weight loss intervention alone.            ",Feasibility Trial of a Problem-Solving Weight Loss Mobile Application,8492838,R21DK098556,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Proliferating', 'Psychologist', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'diabetes risk', 'diet and exercise', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'information processing', 'lifestyle intervention', 'medical schools', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web interface', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R21,2013,263542,0.044746805449343945

As new mental health products move from the highly-controlled pre-marketing setting into clinical practice, comparative safety and effectiveness information is required to inform optimal prescribing and policy decisions. Phase 3 trials usually do not provide sufficient evidence to inform these decisions due to their relatively narrow focus on efficacy defined as statistical superiority over placebo. Observational studies using electronic health- care data play a critical role in generating comparative information in routine care, but are typically conducted long after a drug has entered the market, and therefore can fail to identify serious safety issues in the early marketing experience. Prospective monitoring of medical products starting at the time of market entry offers a promising complementary approach to detect concerns as early as possible. Development of methods for use in a prospective monitoring framework for mental health applications is largely uncharted territory. The goal of the proposed research is to develop improved methods for understanding the comparative safety and effectiveness of new psychiatric medications, and is aligned with the priorities of Strategic Objective 3 in the NIMH Strategic Plan. In addition to pursuing training in mental health through coursework, hands-on experience, and close mentoring by a psychiatrist, I will pursue the following research aims: Aim 1: To implement our available monitoring system prototype, and study its applicability to the special characteristics of prescription drugs used in patients with psychiatric illness, using empirical examples. Aim 2: To customize the monitoring system to the methodological challenges that are specific to comparative research in mental health, in particular the study of drug-drug interactions and the use of disease risk scores and instrumental variables to mitigate confounding by measured and unmeasured factors. Aim 3: To explore the feasibility of using electronic medical records and natural language processing analysis to better capture mental health outcomes which are particularly difficult to identify using administrative data codes and to improve confounding control. Aim 4: To implement the new customized system and prospectively monitor the safety of selected mental health treatments newly marketed during the funding period as data accumulate in ear-real-time. Better detection of safety concerns early in the life cycle of mental health drugs is of great public health importance as it may expedite drug approval and make prescribers more comfortable using new drugs by providing a mechanism for ongoing post-marketing safety monitoring. It will also improve the evidence base for mental health providers, and help to contain use of medications with less favorable risk-benefit relations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need for comparative safety and effectiveness information for medical products soon after market entry to ensure safety alerts are raised as early as possible, and to inform prescribing and policy decisions. We will develop, adapt and rigorously validate different approaches for near-real-time monitoring and methods to address confounding and outcome misclassification that accommodate methodological issues arising from the specific needs and circumstances of people with mental illness. As such, this work will lay the foundation for establishing a successful prospective monitoring system optimally calibrated for use with mental health products and in mental health populations.                ",Improved methods to assess the comparative safety of new psychiatric medications,8581368,K01MH099141,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Applied Research', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Ear', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronics', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Economics', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health application', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'member', 'method development', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'skills']",NIMH,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2013,176472,0.10118363149958454
"Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood psychiatric conditions often require that clinicians make individualized treatment decisions. In an exciting trend in child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) research and practice, there is growing interest and awareness in developing individualized decision rules (IDRs). IDRs use sociodemographic information, illness history, comorbidities, family/interpersonal measures, or biomarkers as inputs and then recommend the type, modality, and intensity or delivery of subsequent treatment(s) as outputs. IDRs provide a framework for personalized medicine: the level of personalization increases in proportion to the amount of useful information (tailoring variables) used as inputs in an IDR. The development of IDRs for the treatment of children with mental illness is an important ""next step"" in interventions research. Large scale clinical trials have established efficacious interventions fr many of the common CAMH disorders. However, despite a strong evidence base for treatments that are effective on average, little is known about which children are more or less likely to benefit from one treatment or another. Before IDRs can fulfill their potential, much methodological work remains to be done regarding how to use currently available data to assist in their development. A key step in developing effective IDRs is identifying tailoring variables to  use as inputs. Tailoring variables are special types of pre-treatment measures that pinpoint which treatment is best for whom. Existing methods do not explicitly (a) identify which measures are most useful (tailoring variable selection), or (b) combine them in an optimal fashion (tailorin variable feature construction). The specific aims of this study are: Aim 1 (Methods). To develop and evaluate a framework for (a) tailoring variable selection and (b) tailoring variable feature construction for individualizing CAMH treatment. The new method will be used to address scientific questions such as: (a) What are the most important measures (e.g., demographic, severity and duration of illness, comorbidity, parental psychopathology, psychosocial environment including family and peer relationships, biological) to use for tailoring treatment? (b) How do we combine them in order to guide treatment decisions (e.g., individual psychotherapy treatment, medication, or their combination)? Aim 2 (Application): To illustrate and evaluate the method by applying it to the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study randomized trial data to construct an IDR for choosing between SSRI, CBT, or SSRI+CBT for children with anxiety disorders. We will apply the new methodology to identify variables and features pinpointing children who are more or less likely to benefit from SSRI, CBT, or combined SSRI+CBT. Results will be used to construct a proposed IDR for pediatric anxiety disorders. We will compare how average symptom and severity outcomes differ on the IDR vs SSRI for all vs CBT for all vs SSRI+CBT for all. This study will provide researchers in CAMH with a novel tool for building IDRs. This study has significant public health impact because it aims to develop tools to personalize treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This is a high-priority area of research for the National Institute of Mental Health. This project aims to develop a new tool for deciding how to personalize (that is, individualize or  customize) treatment for children and adolescents with mental health disorders. This has important  clinical and public-health relevance because, although research has established efficacious treatments  for many child and adolescent mental health disorders, little is known about which children are more or  less likely to benefit from one treatment or another.",Discovering Tailoring Variables in Childhood Mental Health Treatment Research,8494094,R03MH097954,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Future', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Seminal', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Sterile coverings', 'Symptoms', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peer', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2013,79358,0.025482600080968115
"Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project responds to RFA MH 13-260 ""Harnessing Advanced Health Technologies to Drive Mental Health Improvement,"" and is led by a New/Early Stage Investigator. Bipolar disorder (BD) and Schizophrenia (SZ) are leading causes of disability and are the costliest disorders to treat among serious mental illnesses. Ample evidence exists that evidence-based psychotherapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) produce clinically significant improvements in symptoms of BD and SZ, and yet only 5% of patients in the community can access these treatments. Access to CBT for serious mental illnesses is limited by the restricted pool of trained providers, the resource intensity of these treatments, and cessation of reimbursement for psychological services in many public mental health systems. Our research in BD and SZ over the past five years indicates that mobile phones can provide automated yet personalized cognitive behavioral intervention that is feasible, acceptable, and associated with improvements in symptoms, medication adherence and socialization. Our intervention, called CBT2go, integrates ecological momentary assessment with personalized interventions delivered in the moment that symptoms and related experiences occur. We have developed an innovative platform that functions on various screen types, operating system, or data access technologies, and we have begun to incorporate innovative features into CBT2go, including location-based data and personalized predictive modeling, that can potentially lead to transformative mobile interventions. We propose a research study with the overarching aims of evaluating the effectiveness of CBT2go, gathering necessary data to refine its innovative features, and examining its costs, facilitators, and barries to implementation in a public mental health system. We propose a randomized controlled trial with three arms: 1) CBT2go, 2) an ecological momentary assessment only condition to control for self-monitoring and device contact, and 3) standard care. A total of 255 participants with either BD or SZ will be recruited from a large public mental health system that has minimal access to CBT. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks (mid-treatment), 12 weeks (post-treatment) and 24 weeks (follow-up). The primary outcome of the study will be clinician rated global psychopathology, and secondary outcomes will include medication adherence, social functioning, and mental health service utilization. Recognizing that not all participants wil benefit, we propose to examine differential effectiveness in sub-groups. We will also examine mechanisms of change to inform mobile intervention design, focusing on the impact of CBT2go on cognitive insight and dysfunctional attitudes, which are two mediators of change in traditionally delivered CBT. Drawing from experience in implementation research, we will employ a mixed methods approach to assessing the facilitators, barriers, and costs of adoption of CBT2go from perspectives of consumers, technology experts, administrators and front-line clinicians. This study will lay the groundwork for CBT2go to be adapted and implemented with high fidelity in healthcare settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two of the most disabling and costly mental health problems, and few people with these illnesses in the community have access to evidence-based psychological interventions that improve outcomes like symptoms and medication adherence. We have developed, and propose to evaluate, new technology for delivering personalized real-time interventions to people with serious mental illnesses that bypasses current barriers to accessing psychological treatments. If effective, this intervention could help to improve the mental health of people with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in a variety of treatment settings.                ",Real-Time Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Intervention for Serious Mental Illness,8495026,R01MH100417,"['Accounting', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bypass', 'California', 'Car Phone', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Emergency medical service', 'Excess Mortality', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hybrids', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicaid', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Services', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Withholding Treatment', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'coping', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'monitoring device', 'new technology', 'predictive modeling', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'secondary outcome', 'service utilization', 'severe mental illness', 'standard care', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,506938,0.14375747485549653
"Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are marked by significant levels of impairment and psychiatric comorbidity, affecting approximately 5-7% of the US population. Guided self-help cognitive behavioral (CBT-GSH) therapy has been show to be an effective treatment to reduce binge eating for patient with both disorders. However, there is limited uptake among both clients and therapists. One significant factor is self-monitoring, the central component of cognitive- behavioral therapy, which is both time-intensive and cumbersome in its traditional paper format for clients, as well as difficult to comprehensively address in a time-limited session for the therapist. This grant proposes to utilize emerging mobile application technology, as a tool for increasing the potency, accessibility, and efficacy of guided self-help. This will be accomplished by adapting WorkSmart Lab's current commercial mobile product for healthy eating and exercise, Noom Monitor, into a self-monitoring application integrating CBT-GSH tools for binge eaters. Additionally, the application will be used to facilitate real-time feedback to therapists about their patient progres. Therapists will be notified in real-time about any drastic changes in client eating patterns through pre-set alerts designed to assign a grade to therapists, representing each client's well-being. The feasibility and efficacy of the adapted Noom Monitor application will be examined through a randomized control trial comparing CBT-GSH + APP with CBT-GSH conducted at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine's Eating and Weight Disorders Program. The innovative utilization of technology to assist in mental health interventions has widespread implications outside of this proposal, which will be used to strategize the further development and commercialization of this product.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Guided self-help cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT-GSH) has been shown to be a cost-effective and efficacious treatment for BN and BED, but has limited uptake among both clients and therapists, partly due to the time-intensive and cumbersome nature of the primary CBT-GSH intervention, self-monitoring. This grant proposes to utilize a mobile application, Noom Monitor, to reduce the burden of self-monitoring and provide real-time feedback to therapists, to enhance both therapist and client uptake of CBT-GSH. The findings from this grant has widespread implications for public health, as the use of mobile applications to strengthen treatment adherence and augment existing interventions has enormous potential for use within both mental and medical health care service delivery models.            ",Innovative Use of the Noom Monitor Mobile Application for CBT-GSH in Binge Eaters,8521678,R41MH096435,"['Access to Information', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Binge eating disorder', 'Bulimia', 'Calories', 'Car Phone', 'Client', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Eating', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'health record', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'payment', 'phase 2 study', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'purge', 'self help', 'tool', 'treatment adherence', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,"NOOM, INC.",R41,2013,343684,0.048021442775367504
"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,0.025721434306966207
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7837153,RC1MH090021,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consent', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Food', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Long-Term Care', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Social Interaction', 'Staging', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Video Recording', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'depressed', 'depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'pleasure', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'radiofrequency', 'response', 'sensor', 'social']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2009,493779,0.025721434306966207
"A mobile Enabling Technology to promote adherence to behavioral therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies, 06-DA-105: Improving health through ICT/mobile technologies. The ultimate goal of this research is to fundamentally change the ways in which behavioral interventions are delivered. We propose an innovative mobile Enabling Technology-iHeal-that recognizes stressors that threaten a patient's recovery and then delivers evidence-based interventions exactly at the moment of greatest need. Our objective is to determine, within subjects, the extent to which physiologic and affective changes detected by iHeal are predictive, within subjects, of posttraumatic stress or drug cues. The study team has considerable expertise in technology development and in assessment of behavioral interventions in co-occurring disorders. We will study 25 subjects drawn from an existing SAMHSA-funded investigation that utilizes intense case management to monitor progression of PTSD and substance abuse in returning combat veterans. Our proposed investigation will share interventions with the SMAHSA study that are based upon a blending of Motivational Interviewing and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy approaches for PTSD and substance abuse. Specific aims: 1) To evaluate the accuracy with which iHeal characterizes physiological and affective phenomena as acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues; and 2) To evaluate the effect of Motivational Interviewing-based interventions on acute stress reactions related to PTSD and environmental drug cues. This initial proposal is extremely innovative. The proposed iHeal device will employ cutting-edge wireless technology to link wearable sensors to personal mobile computing platforms (e.g., iPhone). This linkage will allow iHeal to detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes, while embedded computing in the mobile platform permits iHeal to deliver evidence-based empathetic interventions at the opportune moment. iHeal can learn to intervene in ways that are most effective for the user, including scripted text-based dialogues modeled after brief interventions; use of motivating images or messages from loved ones; playing a meaningful song; or contacting a counselor at the moment of greatest need. Ultimately, a wearable wireless device that anticipates stressors and intervenes at a likely transition to risky activities has enormous potential in a variety of social, behavioral, and biomedical research enterprises. Importantly, iHeal has immediate commercial applications that will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises. iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology. Changes consistent with acute stress from PTSD exacerbations or drug use cues generate an empathetic conversation between the iPhone and the user, who enters real-time data on social/behavioral/environmental contexts. The iPhone (which tracks time and GPS data) uses predictive software to anticipate upcoming stressors and helps the user avoid them. The public health significance of this proposal is 1) iHeal will detect co-occurring biological and behavioral processes in real time; 2) it will discern undiscovered behavioral states; 3) it will predict a behavior of interest; and 4) it will deliver empathetic interventions to the user at the opportune moment for intervention. Because it is based on the union of existing technology and has immediate commercial applications, iHeal will encourage job growth in behavioral science, biomedical, computer science, telecommunication, and electrical engineering enterprises.               Project Narrative iHeal is an innovative device that uses wearable sensors to detect pulse, skin conductance, and acceleration; the sensor array links wirelessly to an iPhone which has an app that identifies changes in the user's physiology.

"Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this project is to develop a compact inexpensive alternative to the bulky expensive touchpads now required by blind people for audio/touch access to graphical information. Audio/touch is known to provide excellent access to computer-literate blind people as well as people with dyslexia or other severe print disabilities. Preparing Audio/touch materials was very expensive until ViewPlus introduced the IVEO Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) Authoring/conversion software in 2005. IVEO permits virtually any graphical information to be created or converted/imported easily to a well- structured highly accessible SVG format. Tactile copy was also very expensive before 2000 when ViewPlus introduced the Tiger embossing Windows printers that ""print"" by embossing. The new ViewPlus Emprint printer/embossers emboss and also print color images, creating color tactile images particularly useful for people with dyslexia and a number of other print disabilities. An audio/touch user reads an IVEO SVG graphic using the free IVEO Viewer, a tactile copy of the image, and a touchpad. The user places the tactile graphic on the touchpad and presses a point of interest. The touchpad communicates the position of that point back to the computer, and the IVEO Viewer speaks the appropriate information. Tactile text made from mainstream graphics has a distinctive pattern. When a user presses, that text is spoken by the IVEO Viewer. When the user presses a graphic object having a SVG title within the file, that title will be spoken. Objects may also have arbitrarily long description fields that can be spoken and browsed. All spoken information can be displayed on an attached braille display if desired. Graphical information is ubiquitous today, but almost none is accessible to blind people. Government agencies, libraries, companies, and agencies serving people with disabilities could easily send highly accessible IVEO graphics files and tactile graphic copies to clients with disabilities, but there is a ""chicken and egg"" dilemma that must be overcome before they are likely to do so. Few blind people have a touchpad (which cost $500 or more), so few could use that information. The specific aim of this Phase I proposal is to develop an affordable webcam-based prototype as an alternative to touchpads. It is based on an inexpensive webcam that is focused on the graphic and follows a finger. A touchpad press is emulated in this prototype by pressing some computer key with the other hand. This project could be the key to bringing accessible graphics to all blind computer users and is clearly of interest to NEI whose mission statement includes mental health and quality of life of blind people. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This proposal is relevant to the mission of the National Eye Institute, because it could be the key to making nearly all graphical information easily accessible to people who are blind or have other severe print disabilities. Graphical information is ubiquitous in the world today but is not presently accessible to blind people except through expensive and time-consuming conversion by trained transcribers. Making all graphical information accessible would have an obviously highly beneficial direct effect on education and professional opportunities, mental health, and quality of life of blind people. Mental health and quality of life issues for blind people are parts of the mission of the National Eye Institute.          n/a",Webcam Interface for Audio/touch Graphics Access by Blind People,7480812,R43EY018973,"['Back', 'Braille Display', 'Businesses', 'Chickens', 'Client', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disabled Persons', 'Dyslexia', 'Event', 'Fingers', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Mainstreaming', 'Marketing', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Eye Institute', 'Numbers', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Printing', 'Professional Education', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of finger', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tigers', 'Time', 'Title', 'Today', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visually Impaired Persons', 'base', 'blind', 'braille', 'cost', 'desire', 'digital', 'disability', 'egg', 'interest', 'literate', 'print disabilities', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'touchpad', 'vector']",NEI,"VIEWPLUS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2008,100001,-0.018209208465643233
"SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment The phase I objective of SPIMA is to create a phone-based system that longitudinally and remotely assesses the mood of patients suffering from major depression. The ultimate objective of this SBIR is to automate the assessment of depression and deliver that automated assessment remotely over telecommunications or internet infrastructure. The value of the system is for patients and providers to have an unobtrusive way to gain greater insight into the progression of depression, and potential response to therapy. The core technology is the SPIMA index that is calculated based on performing signal processing of voice acoustics and will correlate to standard clinical depression rating scales. The phase I will begin with a first user study to give use case scenarios on the design of SPIMA and collect 150 voice samples from 30 subjects. The voice algorithms will be tested for reliability on these diverse voice samples. Through a second study of fifteen depressed patients over eight weeks, the SPIMA index will be validated. The objective of that study will be to establish the overall feasibility of SPIMA to predict a patient's mood and response to medical therapy over time. In the phase II study, SPIMA will be validated with a larger patient population through a phase IV clinical trial. It will also be applied to run off a mobile phone as a step towards more continuous mood monitoring. The project is significant as it can provide a new means to manage this chronic and debilitating disease. SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individual Mood Assessment SPIMA will make a significant impact on public health by providing a simple and elegant way to monitor depression through voice analysis. The SPIMA index will become an important longitudinal measure of a patient's mood that will be closely related to established depression rating scales. This innovation will ultimately equip the patient and care provider with information to better manage major depression.          n/a",SPIMA: Signal Processing for Individualized Mood Assessment,7326946,R43MH079573,"['Acoustics', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Depressed mood', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endogenous depression', 'Evaluation', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Family Practice', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase IV Clinical Trials', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Solutions', 'Specialist', 'Speech', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telecommunications', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Visit', 'Voice', 'Week', 'Workplace', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'day', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mecarzole', 'response']",NIMH,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2007,123893,0.012121383467639342
"Extending Social Skills Training for Children Through Interactive Technology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Decades of research indicate social-behavioral deficits negatively affect adjustment and place children at increased risk for a myriad of later negative outcomes including depression, substance abuse, and delinquency. Without intervention, social-behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on mental health. Social skills training (SST) is supported as an efficacious method for significantly improving children's peer relations, social behavior, and emotional adjustment and reducing risk of developmental psychopathology. Further, the efficacy of SST interventions is enhanced when training extends outside a treatment setting with practice opportunities. The goal of this one-year SBIR Phase I project is to extend an existing evidence-based small group SST program for children (SSGRIN; Social Skills Group Intervention) into the home environment through a computer-based interactive social training system (ISTS). The proposed ISTS will offer tailored interactive social problem-solving exercises that parallel SSGRIN's in-person intervention. A unique multi- disciplinary collaboration between computer science and psychology will guide development. For the Phase I prototype, the software user-interface, including graphic design, as well as modes of user interaction, story plot and sequence, and hierarchy of causal relations will be developed. Development will build on 3-C's existing work on pedagogical agents in social stories and animation for SST. Via the ISTS, children will actively solve plot-based social problems by interacting with pedagogical agents, purposefully using SSGRIN skills and concepts to navigate the story events. The interactivity of the proposed ISTS will be a significant technological advancement over current SST software enabling story events to be scaffolded based on child's actions and goals. In addition, the proposed ISTS will have a reporting feature built into the software to provide intervention providers with feedback regarding children's interactions with the ISTS to inform their in-person SST efforts. Once the software prototype is created, an initial test of feasibility will be conducted within two target market segments (school- and community-based child mental health professionals; n=30 each) and with targeted end users (children ages 8-12 years and parents; n=30 each) to determine the usability, feasibility, and value of the proposed product. Phase I findings will provide the foundation for the development and testing of the complete SSGRIN-ISTS product during Phase II. Once the ISTS is finalized, a scientific evaluation will be conducted in Phase II to examine whether inclusion of the ISTS results in enhanced treatment benefits for children's social skills, behavior, and mental health, greater generalization of skill acquisition, and higher engagement in treatment compared with SSGRIN alone. The long-term objective of this product is to decrease the development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits. This project addresses the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) calls for early treatment of children who experience mental health to offset potential co-occurring disorders, school failure, and other problems. Problematic peer relations, particularly when chronic, can have a tremendous impact on children's mental health as well as their academic, behavioral, and emotional functioning. Without intervention, social and behavioral problems tend to persist and escalate over time which, in turn, has a tremendous impact on the development of psychopathology. Development of psychiatric disorders due to socio-emotional deficits is a public health concern with annual US economic, indirect cost of mental illnesses estimated at $79 billion. Cost-effectiveness analyses of social skills training programs with even modest effect sizes estimated a monetary savings of more than $95,000 per participant and more than $8 return on every dollar invested. The President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health (2003) specifically calls for the identification and early treatment of children who experience mental health needs in order to prevent the potential onset of co-occurring disorders and break a cycle that otherwise can lead to school failure and other problems.          n/a",Extending Social Skills Training for Children Through Interactive Technology,7326354,R43MH081385,"['12 year old', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Mental Health', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Facilities and Administrative Costs', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Marketing', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Price', 'Problem Solving', 'Problem behavior', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Randomized', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Savings', 'Schools', 'Scientific Evaluation', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Problems', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Writing', 'animation', 'base', 'commercial application', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'emotional adjustment', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'peer', 'posters', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'provider intervention', 'size', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'social skills', 'software systems', 'statistics', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'trial comparing', 'usability']",NIMH,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R43,2007,240453,0.05353612056845244
"An Expert System to Reduce Depression in Primary Care A variety of effective interventions exist for people who seek help for depression. However, there is a lack of effective interventions for individuals who do not seek help or follow through with treatment referrals. We propose to fill this gap in services by developing and testing a Transtheoretical Model-based intervention that will be delivered proactively, on a population basis, to primary care patients who are experiencing symptoms of depression but are not currently involved in treatment. It is the first intervention for depression that is appropriate for individuals in all stages of change-not merely the minority who are prepared to take action. In Phase I of this Fast Track Initiative, the aims are to norm TTM measures, develop the TTM interventions, and determine the feasibility of this approach by assessing study recruitment rates and reactions to the intervention materials. Primary care patients who screen positive for mild to moderate depression and are not involved in treatment will complete surveys for measurement norming (n=100) or participate in a pilot-test of the intervention materials (n=50).

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,9839684,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,532467,0.03412314438624651
"Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth Most mental illness originates in youth: 50% of mental illness is diagnosed by the age of 14, and 75% by 24. Manifest illness emerges after a period of ~8-10 years. Remarkably, functional MRI can detect disrupted patterns of brain function associated with these vulnerable trajectories. However, the emergence of manifest mental illness reflects a complex and dynamic interplay of many biological, developmental, social and environmental factors that may be risky or protective, shared across illness categories, co-vary, and currently lack specificity. Moreover, the ability of fMRI and serial assessment to detect clinically-relevant shifts in dynamic risk trajectories of mental illness is poorly defined. Charting mental illness trajectories to optimize intervention is a critical need. A major obstacle is the identification of specific neural-behavioral risk pathways that shape vulnerable developmental trajectories into various categories of manifest mental illness. The long-term goal of my research is to develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of risk trajectories in the mental health of youth. Consequently, the overall objective of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. My central hypothesis is that specific risk pathways that have specific brain functional correlates characterize discrete peri-adolescent trajectories in major mental illness categories. Further, that functional MRI metrics and serial assessment significantly improve case prediction. This study will leverage a new, unprecedented opportunity to dissect risk trajectories by applying deep machine learning to ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth, including longitudinal data. I will characterize the behavior and specificity of dynamic risk trajectories and their functional neural correlates in 5 major peri-adolescent mental illness categories and determine the incremental predictive value of adding functional MRI to bio-psycho-social data and continuing assessment after age 10, the developmental inflection point for mental illness. Further innovation will accrue from the use of a cloud computing infrastructure to perform the research. My rationale is that elucidating specific risk trajectories and how to best monitor them in peri-adolescence will stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. Concomitantly, I will obtain capstone training in advanced machine learning methods, programming and cloud computing infrastructure, building on my KL2 training in machine learning, data science and the acquisition and analysis of fMRI and bio-psycho-social data. An interdisciplinary mentorship team of international experts in data science, developmental psychopathology, bioinformatics, epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Washington will prepare me for my transition to independence as a physician-scientist working at the interface of computational science and population youth mental health, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist specializing in neurodevelopmental disorders. Charting mental illness trajectories in community populations of diverse youth to optimize early intervention is a critical need in population mental health. The goal of this study is to leverage advanced machine learning methods in unique, new ‘big data’ from 20,000 diverse youth to illuminate dynamic trajectories of mental illness progression, to characterize sustained mental health and to quantify the incremental predictive value of serial and functional MRI assessment. The resulting body of work will elucidate specific dynamic risk trajectories and suggest how to monitor them in peri-adolescence and stimulate more refined prevention and early intervention strategies in youth mental health, known to improve outcomes and reduce resource use. !",Deep machine learning to delineate trajectories of vulnerability and transition to mental illness in youth,9981021,K99MH118359,"['10 year old', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'artificial neural network', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural correlate', 'periadolescent', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social factors', 'symptom cluster']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,156897,0.07536587797539862
"The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent- child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent- child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility, generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore, limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in- time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables, our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion, and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental health problems in childhood are highly prevalent and impairing, placing an immense social and economic burden on society. Parent-child relationships in the early years of life play a critical role in promoting child mental health, with critical and coercive relationships increasing the risk of mental health problems across the lifespan. Our project includes the creation and systematic evaluation of an innovative technology-based therapy system that employs artificial intelligence to monitor and responsively administer dynamic (i.e., as needed) supports to families in real-world settings in order to promote positive family relationships and improve child mental health.",The Development and Systematic Evaluation of an AI-Assisted Just-in-Time-Adaptive-Intervention for Improving Child Mental Health,10010441,R42MH123368,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Mental Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Coercion', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home visitation', 'Hour', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Populations at Risk', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Service delivery model', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training and Education', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'analytical method', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'contagion', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'early childhood', 'efficacy testing', 'family support', 'flexibility', 'foster child', 'handheld mobile device', 'health care availability', 'improved', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'response', 'service delivery', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technology development', 'therapeutic effectiveness']",NIMH,COLLIGA APPS CORP.,R42,2020,416822,0.1112227355195537
"Leveraging interactive SMS messaging to monitor and support maternal mental health in Kenya ABSTRACT Perinatal depression, defined as a depressive episode during pregnancy or in the first year postpartum, is the most common complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of peripartum women globally.

"Deep Learning of Street View Imagery to assess Urban Green Space Relationships with Mental Health:  A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY The built environment is an important modifiable determinant of human health, yet our ability to understand its effects on human health have been limited by the lack of scalable data on specific components (and exposures) of the built environment. The emergence of ubiquitous geo-referenced imagery in the United States (e.g. Google Street View Imagery), combined with recent advances in image processing using deep learning algorithms, offers unprecedented opportunity for measuring street-level built environment features at scales needed for population-based research. To develop and demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms for environmental health research we will: develop methods to assess green space features using street view imagery and deep learning algorithms; create new deep learning algorithms to predict urban green space quality, stress reduction and restorative potential; and apply new street view measures to 9,070 adult Twin Pairs in the Washington Twin Registry to determine associations between green space and mental health. Our proposed study will dramatically move the field of environmental health forward by provided a completely new, transferable and scalable exposure assessment method for assessing built environment exposures relevant to human health and provide robust information on how urban green space influences mental health. Overall, our new approach will provide rich new data sources for environmental epidemiologists, city planners, policy makers and neighborhoods and communities at large.

"Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of this study is to build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system that can inform effective recruitment and retention strategies to prevent excessive turnover. High turnover rates (estimated 25-60% annually) are devastating for mental health care systems, affecting organizations (e.g., cost), employees (e.g., work well-being), and most critically, the quality of care. Human resource departments collect extensive employee data that can be useful predictors for turnover, but these data are not often analyzed to address turnover issues in mental health organizations. Computational methods have greatly evolved and can now access and analyze large and complex data. This pilot study will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1: build and test turnover prediction models by developing and applying machine learning algorithms to existing human resource data; Aim 2: generate critical questions to enhance turnover prediction through qualitative methods; and Aim 3: test the enhanced model in predicting turnover at 12 months. In Aim 1, using past human resource data and service encounters from [two mental health organizations (rural and urban locations)], we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict turnover. The algorithms will address turnover questions simultaneously (e.g., Who are the most likely to leave? What factors predict turnover at varying time points in employment?). In Aim 2, we will interview key informants: “leavers” (employees who voluntarily terminate employment during the study); “stayers” (employees with extreme longevity in the organization); and “predictees” (identified as likely to leave, based on our algorithms). The findings will be discussed in two focus groups in order to generate, refine, and validate 5-10 critical questions to enhance prediction of turnover. In Aim 3, we will conduct an on-line survey of all current employees to assess the 5-10 critical questions and link survey data with data from human resources and services to examine the improved precision between the theory-based model (predictors in the survey) and the data-driven model (machine learning algorithms) in predicting actual turnover 12 months later. Machine learning can model complex and dynamic variable relationships (e.g., handling a large number of variables, accounting for heterogeneity) and overcome limitations in traditional turnover research that often relies on small, cross-sectional, and convenience samples. Successful completion of this study will promote data-driven, evidence-based organizational management practices to address turnover, which is aligned with NIMH priorities of capitalizing on existing data structures and using technologies to improve mental health service quality. This study will be a critical step in developing highly adaptable machine learning algorithms to predict turnover; ultimately, we envision that this system will be partnered with future clinical interventions to reduce turnover in mental health. Project Narrative This pilot study will build a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system to inform effective recruitment and retention strategies for preventing excessive employee turnover in mental health organizations. Successful retention of a quality workforce not only helps mental health organizations and their employees, but also directly impacts the quality of care that clients receive. In addition, a data-driven, evidence-based organizational management system could be partnered with clinical interventions to reduce turnover.",Developing a Data-Driven Management System Using Machine Learning and Mixed-Methods Research to Predict Job Turnover Among MentalHealth Professionals,9895943,R34MH119411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Mental Health Centers', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Effectiveness', 'Employee', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investments', 'Job Satisfaction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupations', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personnel Turnover', 'Pilot Projects', 'Practice Management', 'Predictive Factor', 'Productivity', 'Professional Burnout', 'Psyche structure', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'burnout', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'data resource', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'improved', 'informant', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental health organization', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'rural area', 'structured data', 'theories', 'treatment services', 'urban area']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R34,2020,244635,0.07591840325717998
"Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback Project Summary  The proposed study will develop and evaluate a technology-assisted supervision protocol to promote treatment fidelity and more efficient delivery of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for ADHD in under-resourced community settings. The protocol (LC4S) will be grounded in the principles of measurement-based care. LC4S will task-shift basic supervision tasks to an existing machine learning tool that analyzes and codes therapy recordings for fidelity (Lyssn; lyssn.io; Tanana et al., 2019). These data will be automatically integrated into an established HIPAA-compliant online clinical dashboard that produces performance reports for therapists and supervisors (Care4; www.care4soft.net). Care4 also will be loaded with online facilitation resources for therapists, while supervisors will be trained to lead weekly in-person supervision sessions according to best practices in measurement-based care (Martino et al., 2016; Schoenwald et al., 2009; Webster-Stratton et al., 2014). This trial will be conducted in three community mental health agencies (Psych Solutions, Inc, Behavioral Aid Solutions, Jewish Community Services) in Miami-Dade County, FL that serve low income ethnic/racial minority youth and previously partnered with the research team in R01 MH106587. In Y01 of the project, we will conduct a stakeholder-focused development process for the LC4S intervention that begins with a thorough capacity and needs assessment using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR; Damschroder et al., 2009) and is guided by the Knowledge to Action (K2A) Implementation Science Framework (Graham et al., 2006). In this phase, we will hold monthly videoconference meetings between development teams at each agency, Care4, and the investigative team to iterate the final Care4 interface with an emphasis user-centered design. In year 1, we also will conduct a small open trial to obtain user feedback (12 cases, 3 supervisors, and 6 therapists) on LC4S and we will make final adaptations to the technology and protocol. In year 2, we will conduct a pilot Hybrid Type 3 Implementation- Effectiveness randomized controlled trial (Curran et al., 2012; N=72 youth; 24 youth, 8 therapists, and 2 supervisors per agency) that will randomly assign both therapists and youth to the LC4S condition or enhanced supervision as usual (ESAU). Both supervision conditions will be delivered by endogenous, agency supervisors who are trained in delivery of the EBT and the core elements of its supervision and have access to monthly phone consultation from experts. The proximal target in this R34 pilot RCT is session by session fidelity scores. The distal service delivery outcomes in this trial are: (1) quality of EBT implementation, (2) quantity of EBT delivered in standard intervention time frame, and (3) speed of delivery (i.e., number of sessions and days to EBT completion) for each case. In support of a future R01 that measures the impact of LC4S on patient outcomes across multiple EBTs, this R34 will also focus on developing and validating appropriate study measures, testing for contamination across conditions, and establishing the costs of the LC4S intervention versus ESAU. Project Narrative Evidence-based behavior therapy for ADHD demonstrates a decrement in fidelity and effectiveness when moving from university to community settings, largely due to limited resources in poor communities (Sibley, Graziano, Coxe, Bickman, & Martin, 2020). As a result, access to quality mental health care suffers among minority, socio-economically disadvantaged adolescents who commonly seek care in these settings and are at risk for the worst clinical outcomes (Sibley, Coxe, Stein, & Meinzer, 2020). Artificial Intelligence (AI) and web-based technology can be used to automate and task-shift key supervision and training tasks (i.e., fidelity monitoring and feedback, booster trainings) thus improving fidelity and effectiveness while reducing costs associated with burdensome measurement-based supervision protocols (Tanana et al., 2019).",Community-Based Care for Minority Adolescents with ADHD: Improving Fidelity with Machine Learning-Assisted Supervision and Fidelity Feedback,10112643,R34MH125037,"['Academy', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Competence', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Cost Analysis', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family psychotherapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Palate', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Validity of Results', 'Videoconferences', 'Youth', 'base', 'care seeking', 'community based care', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'dashboard', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'follower of religion Jewish', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial minority', 'service delivery', 'skills', 'social disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomics', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'treatment planning', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R34,2020,359812,0.016183322264775396
"Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress Project Summary/Abstract Maladaptive complications following trauma, including post-traumatic stress (PTS), are highly prevalent in both veterans and civilians, and have been difficult to accurately diagnose, manage and treat. Debate regarding diagnostic criteria and the need to represent the full spectrum of inter-connected features contributing to psychopathology has spawned the development of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). RDoC is a developing framework to help guide the discovery and validation of new dimensions of mental health disorders and their relationships to underlying biological mechanisms. NIMH now has a rich federated database that currently houses raw data from RDoC-sponsored clinical research, and clinical trial data from the National Database of Clinical Trials (NDCT) with information that may help to unlock the complex and overlapping relationships between symptoms of PTS and the underlying biomarkers to fuel improvements on diagnostic and therapeutic frameworks for trauma recovery. The proposed project will apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytical tools to these large, heterogeneous datasets to identify and validate new research dimensions of trauma-related psychopathology and treatment response trajectories and their predictors. Aim 1 will develop an in silico trauma patient population by integrating data from diverse sources, including cross-sectional and observational longitudinal clinical studies housed within available data repositories for trauma and other related mental health research. Data will include medical history, demographics, diagnostic tests, clinical outcomes, psychological assessments, genomics, imaging, and other relevant study and meta-data. Aim 2 will identify multiple dimensions of PTS diagnostic criteria, using a combination of unsupervised dimension-reduction statistical methods, internal and external cross-validation, and supervised hypothesis testing of predictive models to understand the heterogeneous subtypes of PTS. Aim 3 will deploy unsupervised machine learning methods, such as topological data analysis and hierarchical clustering, to identify unique clusters of patients based on symptomatology to develop clustering methods for precision mapping of PTS patients based on disease severity. Aim 4 will use supervised machine learning techniques for targeted predictive analytics focused on identifying treatment responders from the NDCT, and identification of latent variables that predict treatment response. The results of the proposed research project will greatly enrich the field of computational psychiatry research to identify conserved dimensions associated with the complex relationships of psychopathology and precision treatment planning following exposure to traumatic events. Project Narrative A recent restructuring of diagnostic and research criteria for psychiatric disorders has been implemented to promote greater understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the development of complex mental health disorders. The proposed project aims to apply bioinformatics and machine learning analytics to large datasets from trauma-exposed patients to identify and validate dimensions of post-traumatic stress (PTS), relevant biological predictors, and precision treatment response trajectories.",Bioinformatics for post-traumatic stress,9952129,R01MH116156,"['Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Database', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diagnostics Research', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurocognitive', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Grants', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Trauma patient', 'Trauma recovery', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'combat', 'computational platform', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'feature selection', 'federated computing', 'guided inquiry', 'hands-on learning', 'heterogenous data', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'post-traumatic stress', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'statistics', 'stress related disorder', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event', 'treatment planning', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,501996,0.03186888595712348
"Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care This proposal presents innovations to addressing teen depression during routine check-up visits through further development of an online clinical process support system called CHADIS. The primary care provider remains in the center of the process with his/her prior relationship with the family and humanity enabled with computer assistance prior to the encounter as well as moment of care reminders and teleprompted specific hints aimed at enhancing a patient focused balanced discussion of individual strengths and barriers to the teens goals known as a motivational interview. This is made feasible through pre-visit data collection providing relevant details to highlight as well as data to support omitting some traditional guidance areas with lower priority for the individual teen. Any conclusions coming from PCP recommendations and shared decision making is reinforced by a computer-based, always available chatbot guided by artificial intelligence that serves as a bridge to other helping professionals, strengths building resources, as well as conversations based on proven mental health therapies based on earlier pilot data for reducing depressive symptoms. These innovations will be tested via a cluster randomized control trial, demonstrating whether use of the system results in higher rates of screening, reductions in depressive symptoms, and accessing of evidence-based treatment for teen depression. Use of the system is reinforced by engagement of primary doctors and child psychiatrists in a related quality improvement program with data from their participation providing needed feedback for recertification of professional status requirements of their respective specialty boards. Success of the system would mean a new primary care workflow-friendly tool which could help adolescents avoid the significant functional impairment and increased risks that accompany teen depression. If this new paradigm for adolescent health supervision proves useful for depression, adaptations for other teen challenges might also be promising. Approximately 12.5% of U.S. 12-17 year olds had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. Yet, up to 70% of teens with mental health (MH) care needs do not receive necessary care. This proposal addresses the significant public health problem of teen depression through use of a comprehensive, process-driven intervention targeting time points before, during, and after routine visits with primary care providers (PCPs) through a new module to an online clinical process support system called CHADIS.",Online system for identifying and addressing teen depression in primary care,10019727,R44MH116751,"['17 year old', 'Abnormal coordination', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Depression screen', 'Development', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Moods', 'Office Visits', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Qualitative Research', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Specialist', 'Specialty Boards', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'checkup examination', 'child depression', 'control trial', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'implementation strategy', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'programs', 'recruit', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'shared decision making', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'skills', 'success', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,"TOTAL CHILD HEALTH, INC.",R44,2020,502902,0.04413615989861281
"Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness PROJECT SUMMARY Access to mental health specialists is difficult for many patients in the U.S., particularly for the poor and those who live in rural communities. Telemental health is one potential solution for this access problem, and there has been rapid growth in the number of live video-based telemental health visits in the U.S. While there are numerous rigorous randomized-control trials comparing telemental health visits to in-person mental health specialist care, there have been little research on how telemental health is being used in real-world settings. The uptake of telemental health has been very uneven geographically, and what explains this variation is also largely unknown. Our mixed-methods proposal centers on filling these gaps in knowledge. Under the first aim, we will conduct a series of descriptive analyses of data on 75 million adults with Medicare or commercial insurance to understand how telemental health is being used in conjunction with in-person care and whether the growth of telemental health has decreased disparities in the use of mental health specialists among disadvantaged populations. Under the second aim, we seek to explain why there is geographic variation in uptake using robust statistical machine learning. Under the third aim, we exploit the variation in uptake to assess whether communities with greater telemental health penetration have experienced improvements in care for patients with mental illness. In the fourth aim we will conduct qualitative interviews with providers to complement the empirical analyses and understand the key contextual factors underlying our findings. Understanding how telemental health is being used, why there is variation in use of telemental health, and whether telemental health use is associated with higher quality care could help drive future telemental health interventions and influence the ongoing policy debate on telemedicine regulations and reimbursement. Together the results of these aims are consistent with the NIMH's expressed interest in innovative delivery models that can improve care for underserved communities. It is difficult for many patients with mental illness to access care from a mental health specialist. Telemental health is one way to potentially help these patients receive care and the number of such visits for mental illness has increased rapidly. In this project, we will study how telemental health is being used to care for patients with mental illness, what drives variation in use, and whether telemedicine is associated with receipt of higher quality care.",Impact of Telemedicine on Medicare Beneficiaries with Mental Illness,9821740,R01MH112829,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diffusion', 'Disabled Persons', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rural', 'Rural Community', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Telemedicine', 'Telemental', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'care costs', 'contextual factors', 'control trial', 'demographics', 'design', 'disadvantaged population', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'older patient', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'rapid growth', 'rural area', 'severe mental illness', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'trend', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,709065,0.0875090008525676
"Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients Project Summary/Abstract  Mood disorders, like many psychiatric conditions, have their onset in emerging adulthood and often last a lifetime. Mental illnesses have an excessively large loading of Disability Adjusted Life Years, making early intervention crucial for both individuals and society. Differentiating bipolar disorder (BD) from major depressive disorder (MDD) based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) can be especially challenging if clear mania is absent. In fact, BD patients go an average of 6-10 years without the proper diagnosis, with 70% misdiagnosed with MDD instead. The challenge of identifying BD patients among depressed individuals is complex but critical because diagnosis determines treatment. The use of antidepressant (AD) medications in patients with BD can lead to worsening of illness. We have recently shown that, using resting fMRI, we can predict future medication class response with high accuracy (> 90%). In this project we will build on this work to generalize to a new MRI scanner and clinical assessment protocol. In addition we will develop, in consultation with multiple psychiatrists, a cloud-based tool to analyze and report the results from the brain imaging protocol and machine learning analysis, in a timely, meaningful, and interpretable manner. Results are expected to be an important step forward in the eventual development of clinical useful markers of mental illness. 2 Project Narrative  Patients with mood disorders will often spend months to years on the wrong medication, which can also make them worse (e.g., putting individuals with bipolar disorder on antidepressants). There is a great need to develop biomarkers of treatment response in mental illness. This work will build on recent work from our group showing over 90% accuracy using resting fMRI predictors to further generalize the results to multiple scanners and develop an online portal to process and provide reporting of results (classification results) as well as processed data and citation information.",Generalizing and Standardizing fMRI Tools for Differentiating Mental Illnesses and Predicting Medication-Class Response in Patients,10157747,R41MH122201,"['Algorithms', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Medication', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Financial cost', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Mood Disorders', 'New Mexico', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Ontario', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatrist', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adulthood', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'web portal']",NIMH,ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS GROUP,R41,2020,437555,0.022321706849836684
"LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology Abstract Depression is common, costly, and a leading cause of disability. Assessment of behavior and experience related to depression has tended to rely on self-report and interview-based methods. Environmental momentary assessment inserts assessment into people's lives, but still requires active engagement by those being evaluated. We propose to develop and validate a mobile phone-based personal sensing system to detect depression and related behaviors that relies on sensor data that are collected continuously and unobtrusively. Because people tend to keep their phones with them, the mobile phone is an ideal sensing platform, as it can continuously collect data in the context of the individual's life with no ongoing effort on the part of the user. Such systems are already being used to detect simple behaviors, such as activity recognition and sleep quantification, which are more proximal to the sensor data. Aim 1 will develop markers for a broad range of behavioral targets related to symptoms of major depressive episode (MDE; anhedonia, negative mood, sleep disruption, psychomotor activity, fatigue, and diminished concentration) and related domains (e.g. social functioning, stress, motivation) across a representative sample of participants. Aim 2 will combine all behavioral targets using machine learning to 1) estimate MDE and symptom severity cross-sectionally, 2) identify transition from non-depressed to depressed states, and depressed to non-depressed states, and 3) predict MDE and symptom severity 4 and 8 weeks out. Aim 3 will seek to understand the complex relationships among behavioral targets and depression. We will accomplish this by enrolling 1200 representative participants, in six 4-month waves of data collection. Each participant will download software that collects a wide variety of sensor data (GPS, accelerometry, light, Bluetooth, phone usage, etc.) and an app that collects ecological momentary assessments (EMA). Following each wave we will develop algorithms for a subset of behavioral targets and features (a definition of raw sensor data that incorporates meaning, like translating GPS data into “home”). Each algorithm will then be validated in the subsequent wave. After 5 waves (1000 participants), the set of all markers of behavioral targets and features will be combined using machine learning to detect and predict depression. This hierarchical approach extracts information from data at multiple levels, which ultimately is far more likely to succeed than relying solely on raw sensor data. The final wave will serve to replicate and validate the entire depression prediction model. This sensing platform is scientifically significant, as it will provide a fundamentally new tool for obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders. This project has the potential develop new understandings into the etiology of depression. It is clinically significant, as it will allow for continuous, effortless assessment of populations at risk for depression and ongoing evaluation during treatment. Project Narrative We propose to develop a sensing platform that uses mobile phone sensor data to detect a broad range of behaviors related to depression, as well as detect and predict depressive states that require treatment. This system will be able to run unobtrusively and continuously on people's phones. This sensing platform will provide a fundamentally new method of obtaining continuous, objective markers of behavior that are relevant to depression, as well as many other psychiatric and medical disorders.",LifeSense: Transforming Behavioral Assessment of Depression Using Personal Sensing Technology,9982127,R01MH111610,"['Accelerometer', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anhedonia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Psychologist', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Text', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Translating', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'health application', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microphone', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'social', 'tool', 'touchscreen', 'treatment response', 'wearable device', 'wireless fidelity']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,822373,0.04165464480161727
"Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis Dr. Hwanhee Hong is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Mental Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Dr. Hong obtained statistical background for biomedical research from the University of Minnesota and Harvard School of Public Health, where she completed a PhD and a MS in biostatistics, respectively. This K99 training award will help her obtain critical knowledge in mental health research and focused statistical methods to accomplish the proposed project. The proposed project aims to (1) develop statistical methods for estimating population treatment effects in the context of mental health, integrating meta-analytic techniques with a number of existing survey data analysis methods and generalizability methods for a single randomized trial, (2) validate and assess performance of the proposed methods, and apply them to real investigative randomized trials for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (3) extend the proposed methods to network meta-analysis, comparing multiple treatments at once, for finding the best treatment for the general population. This project will enhance the use of clinical trials and meta-analyses in mental health, yielding methods to make better decisions about intervention implementation in general populations, which fits the National Institute of Mental Health’s mission. The two-year mentored training program consists of organized mentorship with regular in-person individual meetings, team meetings, formal coursework in both mental health and biostatistics, seminars, working groups, academic conferences, and career development activities. These training activities will provide the groundwork for the following three-year independent stage. Short-term career goals include to establish a better understanding of mental health research, particularly complex features of mental disorders and outcomes from relevant clinical trials, advanced topics in causal inference, and additional statistical methods for generalizing results of meta-analyses including survey weighting and flexible machine learning methods. Long-term career goals include to build an independent research portfolio and become a leading methodologist in mental health and other multidisciplinary research. The Department of Mental Health of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health provides an ideal setting for training a new independent methodologist in mental health with an extensive program of formal and informal education for post-doctoral researchers, opportunities for collaboration with researchers having expertise in diverse areas, and resources for career development. Dr. Hong will also use all available resources from other Departments including biostatistics, epidemiology, and psychiatry. This environment maximizes the potential for Dr. Hong to obtain the necessary training and perform the research to establish herself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program. This project will help mental health researchers generalize, apply, and implement findings from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials to target populations. Traditional meta-analyses enable us to borrow strength across multiple studies to gain more power, resulting in reliable and precise effect estimates; however they do not consider how well the trials represent target populations of interest. By developing methods to help generalize the results of meta-analyses, we will help translate results into appropriate decisions regarding broad implementation and clinical practice.",Estimating Population Effects in Mental Health Research Using Meta-Analysis,9935960,R00MH111807,"['Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'data access', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open data', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'randomized trial', 'regression trees', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'symposium', 'treatment effect', 'working group']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248999,0.09566822315516571
"CBTpro: Scaling up CBT for psychosis using simulated patients and spoken language technologies Psychosis resulting from schizophrenia spectrum disorders and major mood disorders is one of the most disabling health concerns worldwide. Evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are recommended as standard of care by national psychosis treatment guidelines but are rarely accessible. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for psychosis (CBTp) is the most well-researched psychotherapy for psychotic disorders, yet fewer than 1% of American mental health providers are trained in this intervention. To date, there has been no scalable way to offer high-quality and sustainable CBTp training to mental health providers. The primary objective of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) proposal is to develop and evaluate a spoken language technology tool – CBTpro -- to support high-quality skills training in CBTp. CBTpro will provide a rapid means of scaling and sustaining CBTp in routine care settings across the US, resulting in more clinicians across the country providing higher quality CBTp to individuals with psychosis. This fast-track STTR proposal has two phases. The objective of Phase I is to develop a CBTpro prototype, which requires three core activities: Aim 1: understand community stakeholder needs to inform software design and functionality; Aim 2: develop CBTpro digital content; and Aim 3: train and validate machine learning algorithms to automatically score CBTp fidelity. The objective of Phase II is to optimize and test the CBTpro tool in real world practice settings. Accordingly, in Phase II, we will Aim 1: conduct a lab usability study (Aim 1a) followed by field testing of the CBTpro prototype (Aim 1b) with 20 trainees; Aim 2: conduct a randomized controlled trial of CBTpro training vs. training as usual (N= 100 providers / N=300 clients), using a nested mixed model analysis to determine the effect of CBTpro on client symptoms, functioning, and recovery; and Aim 3: adopting an NIMH experimental therapeutics approach, assess the hypothesized mechanism by which CBTpro affects clinical outcomes through increased provider fidelity to CBTp (mediation), and test whether the strength of the relationship between these variables is affected by client skill acquisition (moderation). This proposal directly addresses the National Institute of Mental Health’s strategic objectives to improve dissemination, implementation, and continuous improvement of evidence-based mental health services (Objective 4.2) and develop innovative models to dramatically improve the outcomes of mental health services received (Objective 4.3), particularly through the use of novel technology. CBTpro has the potential to reduce the high personal and societal costs associated with serious mental illness, redress the challenges of training amidst high rates of mental health system turnover, support supervisors in quality assurance and improvement efforts, and reduce health disparities associated with mental health workforce shortage areas.

"Predictive modeling of peripartum depression ABSTRACT Psychiatric problems surrounding parturition affect both the mother’s health and her child’s developmental trajectory. Peripartum depression (PPD), referring to a depressive episode occurring during pregnancy or after childbirth, is both common and morbid. PPD has been implicated in various short and long term adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery and heightened risk for mental illness in the adult offspring. In extreme cases, PPD can lead to maternal suicide and/or infanticide. Although an estimated 760,000 American women (and children) suffer from PPD each year and screening for PPD has been recommended by the USPTF, no accurate screening tool is available to adequately identify women at risk of PPD. This novel study will capitalize on the rich clinical, demographic, and laboratory information in patients’ electronic medical reports (EMRs) to improve screening for PPD. We propose to implement advanced machine learning methods to build a model to optimize identification of women at risk for PPD. We we will adopt a psycho-social- biological approach of mental illness to prospectively explore the combined effect of various disease-related factors in improving the accuracy of PPD prediction. Our dataset will make use of a sample of 20,000 women who have been followed during their obstetrical care in two leading academic hospitals in Boston. We will gather information concerning socioeconomic factors, relevant obstetric factors, and mental and physical conditions in pregnancy and disease history, as derived from laboratory test results and the patient’s report. We expect our findings to advance scientific knowledge of women at risk for PPD. Our work may lead to the development of a screening protocol that is low-cost and easily performed by health providers in clinical settings. Early identification of women at risk could potentially allow targeted interventions to reduce the prevalence and morbidity of PPD in the US. This in turn could reduce treatment costs, avoid a potentially preventable disease, and improve the quality of care and health outcomes of mothers and their children. Our study accords with the NICD high priority area of research aimed at improving the health of women during and after pregnancy and improving pregnancy outcomes. The proposed project will further the NICHD mission that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that children achieve healthy and productive lives. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripartum depression (PDD) referring to the occurrence of depressive episode during pregnancy or following childbirth is a common and serious illness. While the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends universal screening for PPD, there is no accurate tool to predict women who would be at risk of suffering from PPD. The goal of this study is to test a machine learning predictive model of PPD using information in patients’ medical records to decrease PPD’s prevalence and ultimately prevent it.",Predictive modeling of peripartum depression,9958240,R03HD101724,"['Adopted', 'Adult Children', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Childbirth', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Educational Intervention', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Infanticide', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive service', 'Primigravidities', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Screening procedure', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Suicide', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Cost', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'antenatal', 'antepartum depression', 'base', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'health of the mother', 'holistic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obstetric care', 'patient health information', 'peripartum depression', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'primipara', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'screening', 'sociodemographic factors', 'tool']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2020,84000,-0.015015999900328335
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments.

"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10009334,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2020,229404,0.029316170264970364
"Ethical, Legal and Social Implications in the Use of Digital Technology for Mental Health Applications Digital mental health technology (DMHT) –digital devices (smartphones, sensors) that can monitor and collect personal data from patients (tracking location/voice/motion, self-report), apply algorithms and machine learning (“ML”) to generate and integrate health and risk information (from genomics/family history), and even mediate care (monitoring treatment adherence or chatbot therapy)– is being integrated into mental health clinical care, with the goal of improving access, diagnostics and treatment for mental illness.

"The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes Placebo treatments can induce clinically significant benefits, compared with no-treatment controls, across a variety of disorders. But placebo treatments themselves are pharmacologically and physically inert: Their benefits result from active brain and psychological responses to the treatment context. Neuroscientific studies have established that placebo treatments influence cortical-subcortical brain pathways and neurochemical systems relevant for expectation, appraisals of personal and social meaning, and value-driven learning. These systems are also related to symptom progression across mental health disorders and several other neurological and substance use disorders. Understanding the brain and psychological mechanisms of placebo effects will help improve psychological and neurological (e.g., neuromodulation-based) treatments across disorders. This R01 renewal funds an ongoing program of research that has made fundamental contributions to this literature. It has also identified several significant gaps that are particularly important for connecting placebo research to mental health. One gap is that our understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying placebo effects comes almost purely from studies of pain. The proposed studies extend previous work to study the brain pathways underlying placebo effects in anxiety and social rejection, negative affective processes directly relevant for multiple mental health disorders. Pattern-recognition (machine learning) analyses identify the most symptom-relevant pathways, and test effects of placebo and other context interventions on these pathways. In Aim 1 (Experiments 1-3), we develop models across multiple affective symptoms, parsing affective pathways into those that are symptom-specific and those that generalize across multiple symptoms and outcomes. We also address the role of endogenous opioids, strongly linked to placebo analgesia, in other negative affective experiences. Another gap is that most previous studies of the context variables that drive strong placebo effects—including social influences, treatment history—have not been studied extensively at the brain level. In Aim 2, we study the brain pathways underlying several promising context interventions that enhance the strength of placebo effects, including social modeling of successful or unsuccessful treatment response, initial experiences of treatment success or failure, and the match between placebo suggestions and a person’s predisposition to be receptive to them. Project narrative Though placebo treatments are pharmacologically inert, placebo treatments induce active neurobiological processes related to patients’ expectations, learned associations, perceived care and support, and hope for the future. Studying placebo treatments provides a window into these crucial context variables that will help understand vulnerability and resilience to mental health disorders and beyond. This project continues a successful program of research on the brain mechanisms of placebo effects, taking the work in new directions critical for understanding mental health.",The neural bases of placebo effects and their relation to regulatory processes,9842001,R01MH076136,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Affective Symptoms', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Conceptions', 'Deception', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Naloxone', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Placebos', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wages', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'endogenous opioids', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal function', 'improved', 'negative affect', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'patient expectation', 'placebo analgesia', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'social interventions', 'social model', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,797673,0.028882520894787028
"Sex hormones and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Project summary The untreated burden of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States is a massive contributor to healthcare budgets in both the military and civilian sectors, and better treatment and prevention methods are needed. Fortunately, awareness of PTSD among military service members has grown in recent years, and yet, there is a hidden epidemic of PTSD among civilians and women. Women experience PTSD at about twice the rate of men (11% vs. 5%), but the causes for this sex difference are largely unknown. It has long been suspected that sex hormones play a major role in development of – and also potentially protection from – PTSD and other mental health disorders. This project will provide the largest ever study of sex hormone effects on PTSD and the related mental health outcomes of depression and anxiety disorders. Whereas studies in the past were limited by small sample sizes and results were inconclusive, this investigation will use a massive sample size of approximately 500,000 participants to answer questions about two well-known sex hormones (testosterone and estradiol) and three psychiatric outcomes (PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders). These variables were measured in the UK Biobank, and we have been granted access to the data to study sex hormone effects on mental health outcomes and to study genetic effects underlying both sex hormone levels and mental health disorders. The completion of this work will reveal whether rates of mental health disorders vary with testosterone and estradiol levels. It may be the case that levels of hormones that are both too high and too low are problematic. Given this reality, we will use sophisticated regression and machine learning techniques, and therefore we will be able to detect linear and non-linear relationships between sex hormones and PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. The sample size and study design make this the most powerful study conducted to date, and the results will be generalizable to diverse populations. In addition to the outcomes mentioned above, we will further explore genetic effects underlying relationships between sex hormones and mental health disorders. To do this, we will conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of both testosterone and estradiol. We will then make polygenic scores for testosterone and estradiol, yielding genetic proxies of sex hormone levels which can be used in studies in which sex hormones have not been measured. Finally, we will test for shared genetic effects between genetic effects on sex hormones and genetic effects on psychiatric disorders in order to better understand the etiology of these common, debilitating, and inadequately treated mental health disorders. Taken together, these findings will provide critical foundational knowledge relevant to clinical trials which are currently testing testosterone and estradiol as treatments for PTSD, depression, and anxiety disorders. These results will also provide actionable findings for the development of novel treatment and prevention strategies. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Sex hormone altering medications are prescribed to over 40% of American adults, and yet the mental health consequences of sex hormones are still poorly understood. This project will be the largest ever investigation of sex hormone effects on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety disorders, and the results of this powerful study design will provide much-needed information relevant to the development of new treatment and prevention strategies.

"Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, <20% of individuals with EDs receive treatment. We need a novel solution not only to identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and address treatment barriers. I have established a strong working relationship with the National EDs Association (NEDA), the U.S.'s leading non-profit for EDs, to offer our group's online, evidence-based EDs screen on the NEDA website. Over one year, the NEDA screen was completed >200,000 times. Among screen respondents, the vast majority screen positive for an ED, but of those, most are not in treatment, and only a small percentage click to learn more about one of the options for seeking intervention presented in the screening feedback. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” that is optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such features as: 1) providing a personalized recommendation for seeking intervention; 2) engaging the user in motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; and 3) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage follow-up with care. This research agenda aligns with NIMH's focus on services research and interest in technology-driven approaches to promote engagement with care. I will conduct two studies. First, I will utilize a user-centered design approach to create a prototype chatbot and conduct usability testing with adults with EDs to inform chatbot refinements (Aim 1). Second, I will conduct a randomized optimization trial with adults who have completed screening on the NEDA website and screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment post-initial chatbot use and motivation for treatment and mental health services use at 1- and 3-month follow-ups (Aims 2 & 3). This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a 23 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the three proposed intervention components (n=8 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients. These aims support my training plan in which I will receive expert mentorship and training in: services research and implementation science (Training Goal 1); user-centered design and usability testing, as well as exposure to machine learning (Training Goal 2); novel trial designs (Training Goal 3); and advanced statistical techniques for analyzing longitudinal trial and digital innovation data (Training Goal 4). My expert mentorship team, along with the environment of Washington University, will ensure my success. Results from the proposed study will be used to optimize the chatbot, which I will then test in a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will equip me with the skills to become a leader in addressing the research-practice and treatment gaps for EDs, with a focus on digital innovations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, but less than 20% of individuals receive treatment. I propose a research agenda to design a conversational agent or “chatbot” for increasing mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders, with study data being used to optimize the chatbot for a subsequent R01 randomized controlled trial. This K08 will not only result in the development of a highly scalable solution for facilitating mental health services use among individuals with eating disorders that has potential for widespread dissemination through partnership with the National Eating Disorders Association, but it will also result in an independent research program that addresses critical gaps in the treatment of eating disorders, with a focus on digital innovation solutions.","Developing an Optimized Conversational Agent or ""Chatbot"" to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals with Eating Disorders",9955368,K08MH120341,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exposure to', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Participant', 'Partnership Practice', 'Psychopathology', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Respondent', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'chatbot', 'comorbidity', 'computer program', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health service use', 'implementation science', 'innovation', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multiphase optimization strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'prototype', 'screening', 'service delivery', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'success', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'web site']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,179096,0.05740791946032166
"Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology PROJECT SUMMARY Psychopathology is a very serious public health burden that not only affects adults, but also many children and adolescents. To better understand this devastating problem, the scientific community has focused its efforts on pinpointing the earliest developmental origins of psychopathology. A considerable literature now implicates prenatal stress as a critical determinant of poor psychological functioning in childhood and beyond. However, knowledge about whether the timing of prenatal stress differentially influences the development of child psychopathology is virtually unknown. Gaining such knowledge is the long-term goal of our research. This proposed project “piggybacks” on our current RO1-funded project (NICHD grant # R01HD085990) that is following a cohort of 335 women oversampled for life stress, with data collection starting at pregnancy week 15 until 6 months postpartum. We are conducting a granular assessment of pregnancy stress (measured weekly by maternal report) with the goal of understanding critical periods during fetal life when stress derails later infant behavioral and physiological stress responsivity. The overall objective of this new RO1 project is to follow this cohort into the child's preschool years. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will determine how the differential timing of prenatal stress influences behavior problems and psychopathology measured at age 4, how differences in self-regulation (an important precursor of mental health functioning) mediates the relationship between prenatal stress and psychopathology at age 4, and how these relationships differ between boys and girls. Aim 2 will test a host of postnatal risk factors (e.g., poor maternal mental health, poverty, intimate partner violence) and resilience factors (e.g., sensitive parenting, coping skills) as moderators of the effects of timing of prenatal stress on behavior problems and psychopathology at age 4. Importantly and uniquely, postnatal stress (mother and child) is assessed also in a fine-grained manner by every 3 month assessments from age 6 mos to 4 years. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use an exploratory statistical approach, machine learning, to detect which relatively small epochs of stress in postnatal life (measured every 3 months) interact with small epochs of prenatal stress to maximally influence child behavior problems and psychopathology. This project is innovative in its highly multimethod approach (e.g., behavioral observation, salivary analytes, laboratory tasks), its granular assessment of chronic and episodic prenatal and postnatal stressors, and the novel statistical approaches used to determine which epochs of stress are most relevant for psychopathology. This highly significant research will be the first longitudinal, prospective, multi-method study of how differential timing of prenatal stress influences the development of psychopathology, as mediated by child self-regulation and moderated by postnatal environmental factors. Thus, this study is critical for understanding how early child development sets the stage for psychopathology and will lead to increased understanding of the developmental epochs to be targeted for preventative interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal stress has devastating effects on children's neurobehavioral development, including elevating the risk for mental health disorders. What remains virtually unknown, however, is how the differential timing of prenatal stress affects the risk for later psychopathology, how this risk is mediated by children's capacity to self-regulate, and the role of the postnatal family environment in exacerbating or reducing this risk. The proposed study will provide essential information about how the timing of prenatal stress, child regulatory capacity, and the postnatal environment interact to increase risk for emerging psychopathology, which will inform strategies for developing and implementing interventions to prevent poor mental health and other negative child outcomes.",Timing of prenatal stress and early markers of child psychopathology,10048200,R01HD100469,"['4 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Preschool Child', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Salivary', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Stress', 'System', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavior observation', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'early childhood', 'executive function', 'externalizing behavior', 'fetal', 'girls', 'innovation', 'intimate partner violence', 'maternal stress', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'sex', 'stress reactivity', 'stressor', 'virtual']",NICHD,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,675471,0.012955486205236314
"Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging Project Summary/Abstract Diabetes and depression are major public health problems that disproportionately affect racial/ethnic minorities and low-income individuals in the US. Efficacious interventions for depression and diabetes exist but are not often combined despite similar treatment recommendations (specifically physical activity) for both conditions. Especially in resource-constrained environments, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are cost effective and feasible methods for delivering self-management support given the more ubiquitous penetration across socioeconomic status. Existing mHealth interventions have shown preliminary success but have had difficulty sustaining engagement. When combined with machine learning algorithms, health messages can be adapted to specifically motivate individuals based on their unique profiles. In Aim 1, we will integrate content from interventions targeting diabetes, depression, and physical activity applying user design methods. We will utilize the existing HealthySMS platform as the basis for this intervention. This will be called the Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation (DIAMANTE) study. In Aim 2, we will test an mHealth intervention for diabetes and depression that will generate messages using an adaptive machine learning algorithm that learns from patient step count data (collected passively via a smartphone app) and patient entered blood glucose and mood ratings. We will compare this adaptive, personalized intervention with a static messaging intervention, typical of many existing text messaging interventions. In Aim 3, we will rerandomize non-responsive participants to receiving nurse outreach using a sequential, multiple assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design. We will leverage the SMART design to conserve more expensive one-on-one nurse outreach for the patients who are no longer engaged in the program and need the most support. We will test this intervention with 350 patients from a safety net setting in English and Spanish. The primary outcomes for this study are HbA1c levels and PHQ-9 scores. The results of this study will help us understand the impact of personalizing content utilizing machine learning algorithms as well as the impact of providing clinician support for those receiving mobile health interventions. Since we are testing this intervention in a resource-constrained environment, the results of this study will be relevant for a broader population. Project Narrative (Public Relevance Statement) Diabetes and depression are health problems that are often comorbid and are mutually detrimental when uncontrolled. This grant proposal seeks to develop and test a personalized motivational text messaging intervention to improve management of diabetes and depression with an emphasis on low-income populations. The findings from this study will aid in the development and dissemination of mobile health tools for chronic illness management in diverse patients.",Improving diabetes and depression self-management via adaptive mobile messaging,9968231,R01HS025429,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,387831,0.030310189217731928
"MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS Co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders (COD) are common in the United States and providers have been challenged to provide effective treatments. As a consequence, their clients with COD may experience poor treatment engagement, symptom exacerbation and cycle in and out of emergency services. This is particularly true for underrepresented populations with a COD including individuals whom are homeless and involved in the criminally justice system. Research shows that integrated and coordinated community- based services for COD can improve client outcomes. However, healthcare workforce has a gap in training staff on such treatment techniques, which we aim to close via this Phase II STTR project.  Maintaining Independence and Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach and Networking (MISSION) is a unique evidence-based, trans-disciplinary treatment designed to address the complex needs of individuals with CODs and includes manuals for high risk populations of civilian and veteran homeless individuals as well as those involved in the criminally justice system. Listed in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration-Registry for Evidence Based Practices (NREPP), MISSION has had substantial impact. The Veterans Health Administration has deployed it in their national plan to end Veteran Homelessness. Massachusetts has used it in its Statewide Plan to End Homelessness and written it into Public Law for delivery alongside Veterans Treatment courts. While MISSION is a manualized treatment, a recent multisite implementation study identified the need for more comprehensive training tools. With NIAAA support, the University of Massachusetts Medical School (MISSION developers) partnered with Praxis on a Phase I STTR to (1) develop the MISSION University online training platform, (2) show proof of concept by implementing two training modules and an e-simulation case study, and (3) conduct a pilot randomized trial which demonstrated that training-as-usual Distance Learning (DL) + Technical Assistance (TA) outperformed TA alone.  In Phase II, we will complete MISSION U by developing and testing five new MISSION modules and companion e-simulations tools that test knowledge acquisition and application. We will first do a formative evaluation with 20 learners who will provide feedback on MISSION U modules. This will be followed by a randomized controlled trial similar to Phase I in which 60 learners will be randomized to the DL or the DL+TA conditions. In preparation for future scalability, we will uniquely conduct a qualitative process evaluation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance framework with 42 MISSION U participants to look at facilitators and barriers to implementation. Lastly, we will pilot test machine learning techniques with our 60 individuals who participated in the randomized trial in an effort to help personalize the MISSION U training experience for commercialization. !1 “MISSION U: A Multimedia Training Tool for Treatment of Individuals with Co-occurring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders” is aimed at training providers of services for these individuals. MISSION U challenges prevailing provider training methodology that relies mainly on on-site provider training and/or online training using typical classroom-type materials. This project not only addresses the growing need for new provider training methodologies, but also offers the promise of improving clinical efficacy and reducing training costs and medical expenditures overall.! !",MISSION U: A MULTIMEDIA TRAINING TOOL FOR TREATING INDIVIDUALS WITH CO-OCCURRING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS,9942350,R42AA026751,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Assertiveness', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Case Study', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Community Outreach', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distance Learning', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency medical service', 'England', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based program', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homelessness', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laws', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Multimedia', 'National Health Services', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pre-Post Tests', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Videoconferences', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'clinical efficacy', 'commercialization', 'community based service', 'computer science', 'cost', 'court', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'field study', 'formative assessment', 'health administration', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'outreach', 'peer', 'peer support', 'phase I trial', 'programs', 'prototype', 'provider networks', 'randomized trial', 'satisfaction', 'service providers', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sobriety', 'suicidal risk', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'usability']",NIAAA,"PRAXIS, INC.",R42,2020,738169,0.026863314727329623
"Office of the Scientific Director The NIMH Division of Intramural Research Programs' (IRP) scientists conduct research ranging from studies into the mechanisms of normal brain function at the behavioral, systems, cellular, and molecular levels, to clinical investigations into the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental illness. Researchers study conditions in adults and children such as anxiety, depressive, bipolar, attention deficit hyperactivity, and autism spectrum disorders, as well as schizophrenia. Approaches include experimental therapeutics; functional and molecular imaging; genetics; behavioral, cognitive, molecular and cellular neuroscience; and epidemiology. In part, because of its state-of-the-art facilities, unique funding mechanisms, and location in the nation's capital, the IRP is viewed as a national resource, providing unique opportunities in mental health research and research training.  Susan G. Amara, Ph.D., serves as the Scientific Director for the NIMH IRP and provides oversight to a diverse mental health research portfolio that includes clinical projects on autism, women's health, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mood and anxiety disorders; and basic projects geared toward answering fundamental questions related to mental health in the areas of cognition, genetics, learning and memory, and behavior. The portfolio also includes projects aimed at exploring new technologies and approaches to neuroscience such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG). The Scientific Director provides supplemental resources, as appropriate, to research projects in the IRP portfolio.  In FY2020, the Office of the Scientific Director (OSD) continued to support collaborative activities within NIMH and with other NIH institutes, including collaborative research projects involving three or more PIs, and several scientific workshops and seminar series, for example, the MEG-North America Workshop, AFNI Kickstart Workshop (DC Code Convergence), Workshop on Multimodal Neuroimaging and Neuroscience,  and a seminar series on machine learning in neuroscience and psychology. Of note, the OSD purchased a new 7-Tesla magnet for the fMRI core facility, which will serve many investigators at NIMH and other NIH institutes. The OSD also continued to host the seminar series called, ""New Discoveries in Mental Health Research."" The purpose of the seminar series is to help intramural scientists to learn more about innovative extramural research that is relevant to the NIMH mission, and to build new relationships with investigators outside of the Intramural Research Program. Searches for both senior and tenure-track clinical investigators continued, and two new searches were initiated, one for an investigator to lead a research program in brain development and another focused on computational psychiatry/neuroscience. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OSD centrally purchased computers to enable widespread telework, provided personal protective equipment for IRP staff returning to the workplace, and developed tools for safely managing on-site activities. n/a",Office of the Scientific Director,10265211,ZIAMH002917,"['Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Capital', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Congresses', 'Core Facility', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Ethics', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Institutes', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'North America', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Subjects', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Site', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Workplace', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinical investigation', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'imaging genetics', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'mental disorder prevention', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'telework', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2020,19153846,0.045667610682382447
"The Digital Phenotype of Bipolar Disorder: Harnessing Technology to Identify Bipolar Mood Symptoms Project Summary Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. It typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood, an important developmental period during which higher education, first jobs, and relationships are pursued. Recurrent mood episodes during this period can have a devastating impact on a young person's ability to achieve a high quality of life as an adult. A method by which to predict the onset of mood symptoms in adolescence would create an opportunity to intervene and reduce exposure to the harmful effects of recurrent episodes. A new approach – digital phenotyping – may make this possible. Digital phenotyping is defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors (accelerometer, texts, calls, GPS). Digital phenotyping has been used to identify mood changes and potential signs of relapse in adults with BD, but has not yet been applied to adolescents. We will use Beiwe, a digital phenotyping application for iOS and Android phones, to collect digital phenotypes from participants (aged 14-19) over 18-months (N=120; n=70 with BD [I, II, Other Specified], n=50 typically-developing). Over the follow-up period, participants will complete biweekly mood assessments, and both participants and caregivers will be interviewed monthly to track changes in mood/behavior. This will allow the phone sensor data collected with Beiwe to be closely linked to symptom changes. The specific aims of this project are (1) to characterize the digital phenotype of BD symptoms in adolescents, (2) to describe differences in the digital phenotypes of the BD and typically developing groups, and (3) to develop a model for predicting mood symptoms prospectively. The proposed study is consistent with all four NIMH strategic objectives for the future of mental health research. This K23 Award will provide Anna Van Meter, PhD with the necessary training and mentorship to (1) gain proficiency in computational psychiatry by learning to analyze longitudinal data using statistical and machine learning techniques, (2) build expertise in patient-oriented translational research by designing and conducting a longitudinal study with youth participants; (3) learn to employ state-of-the-art mobile technology to personalize assessment and intervention using patient data. To accomplish these training goals, Dr. Van Meter has organized an outstanding mentorship team (Anil Malhotra, MD, Jukka-Pekka Onnela, DSc, John Kane, MD, Christoph Correll, MD, and Deborah Estrin, PhD), with expertise in patient-oriented research, technology-based mental health research, computational psychiatry, bipolar disorder in youth, and computer science. The proposed study will be the first to describe the digital phenotype of BD in adolescents, a population at great risk for the onset of BD as well as the damaging effects of repeated episodes. The completion of the proposed K23 Mentored Career Award will support an innovative program of patient-oriented research, and will provide Dr. Van Meter with the skills necessary to become an independent investigator pursuing novel technological solutions to improve patients' quality of life. Project Narrative Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence; recurrent mood symptoms during this period can have a devastating impact on a person's ability to achieve a high quality of life. Digital phenotyping, defined as the “moment-by-moment quantification of the human phenotype in situ” using data collected from smartphone sensors, may make it possible to better understand and predict the onset of mood symptoms with minimal burden to the individual.

"Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The purpose of the new funding opportunity announcement, RFA-OD-17-004 for Intensive Longitudinal Analysis of Health Behaviors: Leveraging New Technologies To Understand Health Behaviors (U01), is to establish a cooperative agreement network to collaboratively study factors that influence key health behaviors in the dynamic environment of individuals, using intensive longitudinal data collection and analytic methods. Importantly, progress has been slow and frustrating in translating knowledge of the brain to new and more effective treatments for human brain diseases such as severe mental disorders. In fact, severe mental disorders, which include psychotic disorders, are brain diseases that are not only devastating because they result in severe disruptions that occur early in life, but, for many, the course of illness is progressive, leading to chronic debilitation and early mortality. Thus the need to accelerate knowledge about the factors that trigger (or increase or decrease the likelihood) of manic and psychotic episodes, and to translate this knowledge to more effective treatment interventions, is critical. The primary goal of the proposed “Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions. The eventual goal of this work is to provide quantifiable and predictable information that can be used to scaffold biological observations and tailor intervention strategies to maximize efficacy at the individual level. We first develop models to predict conventional clinical measures specific to psychosis and mania using (1) digital, low- to-minimal burden interactions through smartphones and wearables (Aim 1), and (2) measures extracted from face and voice during in-person clinical interactions (Aim 2), work which leverages existing data we have already collected. We will next collect one hundred person-years of pseudo-continuous multivariate behavioral data from one hundred individuals with a psychotic disorder, to further test and validate our early observations in a wider array of individuals with affective and non-affective psychotic disorders, who are likely to experience illness fluctuations within a one-year timeframe, employing several strategies to optimize participant engagement (Aim 3). We will also perform, as a representative example, a study comparing sleep, energy expenditure, and mania symptoms over time, using data obtained in the first three aims, to quantify how the relationship between energy expenditure and energy perception varies across our study population in ways that could have important consequences for health behaviors (Aim 4). The main goals of this project are thus to acquire high quality, temporally dense behavioral, cognitive, and clinical data on an important cohort of young adult patients, not only to facilitate future investigations linking these behavioral change points to neurobiological processes but also as a precursor to more effective, targeted therapeutics, such as real-time interventions that could be delivered based on dynamic factors in an individual's environment. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE The main goal of the proposed “Robust predictors of mania and psychosis” is to identify biological, environmental, and social factors that trigger dangerous mental states, particularly mania and psychosis, in individuals known to be at risk for these conditions by acquiring high quality, temporally dense, longitudinal behavioral data, and using machine learning approaches to iteratively identify factors that increase or decrease the likelihood of these conditions. We focus on early psychosis (both affective and non-affective psychosis), which is a critical time period when there are fewer confounds such as prolonged medication exposure and chronicity, and when early intervention strategies will be most effective, prior to the progression that often leads to debilitating and chronic illnesses, to great suffering, and to an enormous public health problem and economic burden. By developing predictors for mania and psychosis from smartphone, wearable, and audio- video data and then testing these predictors over 100 person-years in individuals with active psychotic disorders, the data collected will make it possible to identify specific factors in the physical, social, and/or built environment that facilitate or hinder healthy behaviors in early psychosis and bipolar disorder and lay the groundwork for tailored intervention strategies that fully account for these factors to maximize efficacy at the individual level.",Robust Predictors of Mania and Psychosis,9938687,U01MH116925,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Economic Burden', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physical environment', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Social Environment', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'built environment', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'energy balance', 'experience', 'gaze', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'mental state', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'social', 'social factors', 'study population', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'time use', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,U01,2020,710639,0.03987764761319261

"Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression Phase IIB Abstract -FINAL A large body of evidence supports the idea that disruptions in the regularity of behavioral routines (or ‘social rhythms’) can lead to the onset of mood symptoms and full-blown episodes via their impact on endogenous circadian rhythms and, conversely, that stable social routines protect against new mood episodes. Based on our conviction that monitoring, evaluating, and increasing the regularity of behavioral rhythms has broad applicability for improving mental health, we established HealthRhythms, Inc. (www.healthrhythms.com) with the goal of using mobile technology to enhance our capacity to monitor and treat such conditions, with a particular emphasis on mood disorders. Our product vision capitalizes on the ubiquity and intimacy of smartphones and their capacity to automatically and continuously sense parameters of behavior that represent key indicators of depressive symptomatology captured on a 24/7 basis in the user’s natural environment. It also capitalizes on the capacity of smartphones to deliver interventions that are easily accessible, can be delivered with optimal timing and, perhaps most important, are enormously scalable. Finally, smartphone technology gives us the capacity to bring empirically validated psychosocial interventions to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such interventions and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse. Under the auspices of our Phase II SBIR funding (R44MH113520-01-02), we have developed both such a monitoring product (Measure) and have developed and tested such a digital intervention platform (Cue). Analyses conducted to date indicate that Cue leads to significantly greater decreases in depressive symptomatology than monitoring alone via Measure. We now propose to: 1) upgrade to Cue and its accompanying clinician dashboard to be commercially marketable and 2) carry out the clinical trial necessary for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0 as a mobile device. Cue 2.0 will include enhanced designs, more in-depth psychoeducational material, and a fully automated engine for delivering behavior change suggestions to improve the regularity of users’ social and behavioral routines. Building on the accomplishments of our Phase II funding, this SBIR Phase IIB proposal is focused on bringing Cue to market as a scientifically validated and profitable digital intervention for individuals with depression with or without co-occurring anxiety disorder. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Develop and validate Cue 2.0 a fully automated digital intervention platform. Aim 2: Carry out all necessary steps to apply for FDA licensing of Cue 2.0.  PROJECT NARRATIVE HealthRhythms, Inc. is on a mission to become the world leader in tracking clinically meaningful behavioral rhythms in order to provide automated behavior change suggestions to patients around the globe. The work we propose in this SBIR Phase IIB application will enable HealthRhythms to further develop Cue, our smartphone-based intervention platform for depression, and carry out the work necessary to obtain FDA clearance for Cue as a medical device. This will enable us to bring a tested psychosocial treatment to the hundreds of thousands of depressed patients who otherwise would not be able to access such treatment and, thus, speed their recovery and prevent relapse.",Automating and Obtaining FDA Approval for a Digital Intervention for Depression,10081882,R44MH113520,"['Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consultations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'convict', 'dashboard', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'digital', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'intimate behavior', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mood symptom', 'prevent', 'psychoeducational', 'psychosocial', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'usability']",NIMH,"HEALTH RHYTHMS, INC.",R44,2020,974672,0.049619845605283396
"Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality Project Abstract: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has been demonstrated to be effective for numerous presenting problems, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Several large mental health systems have invested heavily in programs to train their clinicians in CBTs, but relatively little attention has been devoted to the monitoring or promotion of CBT quality after training is complete. Identifying strategies to do so can facilitate research and training, and is critical to ensuring consumer access to high quality, evidence-based treatments. The lack of a scalable, effective, and efficient method of monitoring quality is a key barrier to efforts to promote high-quality implementation. Self-report fidelity assessments increase clinician and consumer burden and may not accurately reflect clinician skill or the intensity with which CBT interventions are delivered. Observation and expert ratings are time and resource intensive and unlikely to be feasible or affordable in large systems. To maximize the likelihood of broad implementation once effective strategies to monitor quality are established, it is essential that these strategies are feasible and acceptable in routine care contexts, leveraging information collected during routine care. To date, few monitoring strategies that do not involve observation, client/caregiver reports, or clinician self-reports have been tested. To address this critical implementation challenge, we propose to refine and evaluate a method of monitoring quality that is based on an evaluation of CBT worksheets that are completed in session. Because the worksheets were developed to implement core cognitive and behavioral elements and are embedded in CBTs across diagnostic categories, they may be used to elucidate the clinician’s ability to guide the client through CBT interventions in session. Preliminary research with this measure demonstrated high correlations between the measure and observer ratings of clinician competence, associations with subsequent symptom change, and high agreement between raters with differing levels of familiarity with CBT. Completion of the ratings based on worksheets requires only a small fraction of time required for session observation and ratings. This project will compare this novel strategy to observer ratings and adherence checklists that are embedded in clinical notes. Furthermore, it will compare the accuracy of worksheet data collected by mobile app to paper-form worksheets, and assess the feasibility and acceptability of these strategies. Because the core elements of CBT and its worksheets are common across many CBTs, this research has broad implications for monitoring fidelity to CBTs in a variety of mental health and healthcare systems and settings. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators with expertise in CBT, training, implementation, psychotherapy process and outcome research, psychometrics, longitudinal data analysis, mobile technologies and healthcare economics, with input from community partners and end-users. The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts to monitor and ensure ongoing high quality implementation of CBT in routine care settings. Project Narrative: This project will compare two methods of assessing the quality of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that do not involve directly observing sessions, adherence checklists embedded in clinical notes, and rating the quality of worksheets that are completed with therapist guidance during sessions. It will also examine whether ratings of worksheets completed on a mobile app are reliable and valid quality measures. This information can inform strategies to monitor and enhance CBT quality, which can ultimately improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes.",Leveraging Routine Clinical Materials and Mobile Technology to Assess CBT Quality,9901579,R01MH112628,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Anxiety', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Categories', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Light', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical material', 'cognitive enhancement', 'community setting', 'cost', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care economics', 'health care settings', 'health economics', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'routine care', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'statistics']",NIMH,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2020,634252,0.05051283356188445
"Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach PROJECT SUMMARY: Internalizing/externalizing psychopathologies are identifiable by age 3, with neurodevelopmental risk markers evident in infants. Despite powerful implications for prevention, clinical impact has been minimal. We use innovative computational and epidemiologic data science methods to accelerate clinical translation of neurodevelopmental discovery during infancy towards generalizable risk prediction for preschool psychopathology. Our main objective is generating a pragmatic clinical risk calculator for public health use, the Mental Health Risk Calculator for Young Children (MHRiskCalc-YC). To achieve necessary power and precision, we create the Mental Health, Earlier Synthetic Cohort (MHESC), pooling multiple extramural cohorts at Washington University and Northwestern University to form the first clinically- enriched “synthetic” neuroimaging cohort for generation of neurodevelopmentally-based clinical risk algorithms (N=1,020, followed from birth-54 mos.). To maximize the risk calculator's clinical and research utility and cost effectiveness, we will generate a series of risk algorithms tailored to envisioned end-users, incorporating input from clinical stakeholders. Algorithms will also establish added value of pre-postnatal environmental factors in risk prediction, a crucial but understudied RDoC element. Aim 1 optimizes clinical feasibility and cost effectiveness by generating an MHRiskCalc-YC algorithm derived solely from commonly used survey data to optimize feasibility for future use in primary care settings. Aim 2 optimizes precision of prediction by establishing statistical and clinical incremental utility of more intensive assessment for future use in mental health specialty settings. This algorithm sequentially tests the added predictive value of methods of intermediate-high intensity (from direct assessments to EEG to MRI) for most precise, least burdensome risk prediction. The Aim 3 algorithm is optimized for future clinical research use in neurodevelopmental consortia, modeling the added value of MRI data to the Aim 1 algorithm. This mirrors “common” protocols of neuroimaging consortia and will also generate an empirically-derived best practices guide for consortia to optimize timing/ number of neuroimaging assessments. External validity will be established in the Baby Connectome Project (BCP). The MHESC capitalizes on an unprecedented, time-sensitive opportunity to accelerate scientific and clinical impact of multiple extramural activities that have been extensively pre-aligned. The public health impact of an infancy-based clinical risk prediction tool for preschool psychopathology has transformative potential for altering standard of care in early identification and prevention of mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Mental disorders are often early-onset chronic diseases, with brain and behavioral risk markers of common internalizing/externalizing problems evident in infancy. To accelerate translation, we will use multi-method imaging, behavioral and data science innovations to generate an infant mental health risk calculator for pragmatic public health use, derived from a clinically enriched “Mental Health Earlier-Synthetic Cohort” of 1,020 infants using established study samples (characterized from birth-54 months). Clinical prediction algorithms will deliver broadly useful tools for earlier prediction and prevention of mental disorder and parameters to inform when imaging methods will be most informative in large-scale neurodevelopmental studies.","Optimizing prediction of preschool psychopathology from brain: behavior markers of emotion dysregulation from birth: A computational, developmental cognitive neuroscience approach",10056737,R01MH121877,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Height', 'Infant', 'Interview', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Studies', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effectiveness', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'emotion dysregulation', 'epidemiologic data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mental disorder prevention', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'prediction algorithm', 'primary care setting', 'protective factors', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,1858980,0.03819963297834098
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,0.038305324021592924
