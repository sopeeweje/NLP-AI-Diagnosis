"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9735964,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,626851,0.02265647164245495
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Built upon our previous success with PubTator which has served annotated PubMed abstracts for 300 million requests, we expanded its scope to include automated concept annotations for full-length articles in the newly released PubTator Central (PTC) system. Specifically, PTC annotates PubMed (29 million abstracts) and the PMC Text Mining subset (3 million full text articles). Annotations are downloadable in multiple formats (XML, JSON and tab delimited) via the online interface, a RESTful web service and bulk FTP. Improved concept identification systems and a new disambiguation module based on deep learning increase annotation accuracy, and the new server-side architecture is significantly faster.   To facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations in the biomedicine domain, we introduced the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark. The benchmark consists of five tasks with ten datasets that cover both biomedical and clinical texts with different dataset sizes and difficulties. We also evaluate several baselines based on BERT and ELMo and find that the BERT model pre-trained on PubMed abstracts and MIMIC-III clinical notes achieves the best results. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available.   In 2019, we developed ML-Net, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework, for multi-label classification of biomedical texts where each document is associated with one or more labels. As an important task that has broad applications in biomedicine, a number of different computational methods have been proposed. Many of these methods, however, have only modest accuracy or efficiency and limited success in practical use. Our ML-Net method combines a label prediction network with an automated label count prediction mechanism to provide an optimal set of labels. This is accomplished by leveraging both the predicted confidence score of each label and the deep contextual information (modeled by ELMo) in the target document. Our benchmarking results show that ML-Net compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods in multi-label classification of biomedical text. ML-Net is also shown to be robust when evaluated on different text genres in biomedicine.   In addition to tackling text-mining tasks with supervised machine-learning methods that typically require a large amount of annotated labeled data for algorithm training, we proposed a novel semi-supervised learning algorithm based on variational autoencoders (VAE) in order to utilize unlabeled data to reduce the burden of manual annotation required in supervised learning. Our model consists of the following three parts, a classifier, an encoder and a decoder. The classifier is implemented using multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and the encoder and decoder are implemented using both bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTMs) and CNNs, respectively. The semi-supervised mechanism allows our model to learn features from both the labeled and unlabeled data. We evaluate our method on multiple public PPI, DDI and CPI corpora. Experimental results show that our method effectively exploits the unlabeled data to improve the performance and reduce the dependence on labeled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised VAE-based method for (biomedical) relation extraction.   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we organized a challenge task on text mining for precision medicine through BioCreative VI. The challenge was organized in two specific sub-tasks: (i) document triage subtask, focused on identifying scientific literature containing experimentally verified protein-protein interactions (PPIs) affected by genetic mutations and (ii) relation extraction subtask, focused on extracting the affected interactions (protein pairs). To assist system developers and task participants, a large-scale corpus of PubMed documents was manually annotated for this task. Ten teams worldwide contributed 22 distinct text-mining models for the document triage task, and six teams worldwide contributed 14 different text-mining systems for the relation extraction task.  Separately, we have applied cutting-edge deep learning techniques to the literature triage process for human kinome curation and the identification of translational research in genomic medicine beyond bench to bedside from the biomedical literature. In both applications, automated computer results are compared and validated by the expert curators of the two databases: neXtA5 and the CDCs Public Health Genomics Knowledge Base. Both results show that our deep-learning based computer method is more efficient and can replace the traditional manual triage methods of those databases. Our methods can give human curators more time to focus on more challenging tasks such as actual curation as well as the discovery of novel papers/experimental techniques to consider for inclusion.  As shown above, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies this year. In addition to applying it to natural language processing, we have also seen its success in our medical image analysis such as processing chest X-rays, CT images, and various kinds of retinal images for autonomous disease diagonosis and prognosis. One such project relates to Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries and, by 2040, will affect approximately 300 million people worldwide. Accurate AMD severity detection and progression prediction to sight-threatening late disease stage is thus of significant importance for personalizing monitoring and preventative interventions. As a joint effort between National Library of Medicine and National Eye Institute, we developed novel machine-learning approaches to automatically classify AMD severity levels and predict risk of progression to late AMD based on retinal images taken from two US multi-center longitudinal studies. We demonstrated that the fully automated deep learning model was superior to existing clinical standards and has the potential for improved patient care. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,10007525,ZIALM091813,"['Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'E-learning', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Eye Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'formycin triphosphate', 'improved', 'information model', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'language training', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'long short term memory network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'protein protein interaction', 'retinal imaging', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'text searching', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,1901416,0.06683145345844609
"Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question The Repository for Informed Decision Making, Clinical Question Answering and Consumer Health Question Answering projects are addressing the above objectives by developing knowledge-based and machine learning approaches to extraction and structuring of information in biomedical literature and other types of text (such as clinical notes and registered clinical trials) for the following types of information: 1) the diseases and conditions; 2) the numbers, co-morbidities, and socio-demographic characteristics of study subjects/participants, such as species, gender, smoking status and alcohol consumption; 3) the therapeutic and diagnostic interventions; 4) the study and publication types; 5) the end-points and the outcomes of the studies; 6) drug interactions and 7) adverse drug reactions.  In FY2019, we have developed a number of approaches to facilitate understanding information requests sent to NLM customer services and long queries submitted to MedlinePlus search engine. Information requests sent to customer services are often several paragraphs long and provide the background and context that the customers believe will help understand their needs. For example, customers often describe several generations of their families affected by a disease and ask if their children will have it. The long MedlinePlus queries consist of one or two sentences and are often formed as questions. Both of these request forms are usually ungrammatical and rife with misspellings, abbreviations and informal language. We have developed a spellchecker for consumer language that is performing adequately on the misspellings important to understanding of the needs. After correcting spelling, our system employs three modules: a knowledge-based and a supervised machine learning method to understand the main points of the request, such as the disease or a drug of interest and the type of information about it. The systems extract the main points, which we found are sufficient to automatically search MedlinePlus and find authoritative and relevant pages for 65% of the requests. The third approach is to find similar questions that already have authoritative answers, e.g., provided by NIH institutes. In FY2019, the prototype consumer health question answering system https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/ was used to create data collection for a community-wide evaluation of approaches to question answering, which attracted 70 academic, industry and government teams from five continents.  Our clinical question answering system is based on the framework for asking well-formed questions developed by the evidence-based medicine experts. Their analysis showed that presenting a clinical information need as four-part question frame: patient characteristics/problem; planned intervention; comparison; and desired outcome, helps formulate search engine queries that lead to relevant results. We developed methods for automatic extraction of question frames from information requests, automatic query formulation and automatic extraction of answers from retrieval results. The LHC CQA1.0 system extracts the bottom-line advice from biomedical publications and aligns the question frames and the answers to find the best answer. The CQA 1.0 system is currently used to support development of evidence-based care plans at the NIH Clinical Center, to provide bottom-line for retrieved images in the LHC Open-i system and to provide summaries of the biomedical articles in the LHC Open Summarizer. n/a",Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question,10016943,ZIALM010009,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publications', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Services', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'evidence base', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'repository', 'search engine', 'sociodemographics', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,533106,0.043667612778705685
"Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services Over the last decade, the online search for biological information has progressed rapidly and has become an integral part of any scientific discovery process. Today, it is virtually impossible to conduct R&D in biomedicine without relying on the kind of Web resources developed and maintained by the NCBI. Indeed, each day millions of users search for biological information via NCBIs online Entrez system. However, finding data relevant to a users information need is not always easy in Entrez. Improving our understanding of the growing population of Entrez users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by NCBI.   Among all Entrez databases, PubMed is the most used one and often serves as an entry point for people to access related data in other Entrez databases. Tools to aid searching PubMed are query suggestion, expansion, and spelling correction. Dedicated best match algorithms aid navigational queries by ignoring minor errors and aid informational searches using machine learning to combine relevant signals such as article popularity, publication date and type, and query-document relevance score. Additional valuable aids including identifying related articles and author name disambiguation.  PubMed Labs provides a place to trial and improve new search features. It features a clean and mobile-friendly design tailored specifically towards small screen devices and a platform for users to provide feedback guiding future work.  While search has usually focused on full documents or references, the value of sentence search is rising. It can identify specific statements rather than whole articles on a general topic. Our new tool, LitSense, provides sentence level search, making sense of biomedical literature at sentence level.  A specific use of sentence similarity is to aid the curation efforts in the Conserved Domain Database (CDD). To this end, LitSense has been used to both finds sentences in PubMed articles already used to create CDD summaries and identify new sentences closely related to existing CDD summaries.  For using sentences in Deep Learning tasks, BioSentVec is the first sentence encoder specifically for the biomedical domain. It better captures biomedical semantics than general domain encoders.  Of course, word embeddings remain the primary method of using Deep Learning in NLP tasks. BioWordVec uses subword information and MeSH to generate biomedical word embeddings that can significantly improve performance. Biomedical terminology often includes important subword information. The semantic information available in ontologies such as MeSH is meaningful. A generic word embedding cannot take advantage of this valuable supplemental information.  These machine learning methods benefit from having a large amount of text available. To that end a Web API serves BioC versions of the PMC Open Access Subset and Author Manuscripts. This is a continuously updated complement to our existing FTP service. The documents are available in either JSON or XML and both ASCII and Unicode encodings are available. n/a",Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services,10007518,ZIALM000001,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Devices', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Information Services', 'Internet', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Molecular Biology', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reference Values', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Update', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'design', 'formycin triphosphate', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'navigation aid', 'online resource', 'research and development', 'spelling', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,2139093,0.060529493490750055
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science Over the past year, we have been active in: (1) developing computationally efficient methods and algorithms to solve known problems in the analysis of biomedical and clinical data and study complex interactions in biological systems; (2) developing knowledge-based data management systems for the discovery and curation of biomedical knowledge, including distributed annotation systems and laboratory information management systems;  (3) applying predictive-analytic models to scientific and administrative domains; and (4) consulting with NIH leadership to provide evidence-based solutions to improve the grant application and review process.  Specifically, in 2019, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following:  - In a partnership with Dr. John Tsang of the NIAID Laboratory of Systems Biology, HPCIO is conducting a multifaceted project to profile the immune system using the latest high-throughput, multiplexed technologies and systems approaches. One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop novel computational methodologies that can exploit inter-subject heterogeneity and measurements at various scales to assess the roles of the immune system in health and disease.  Currently, we are developing a multi-level linear model utilizing ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from monogenic disease patients to dissect the gene regulatory network.  The results will provide insights on the impacts specific genetic lesions have on downstream genes and how they are manifested at the clinical phenotypical level.   - HPCIO has entered into a wide-ranging collaboration to provide data science support and innovation to Dr. Leorey Saligan and the Symptom Management Branch of NINR.   An existing effort to identify radiotherapy-related fatigue genes from a PCR assay of oxidative stress using machine-learning methods has largely been completed.   In addition, a number of new efforts were initiated in 2019.   To provide guidance for future scRNA experiments to identify clusters of cells and their marker genes associated with wound healing in mice, an analysis of a similar experiment deposited to the Sequence Read Archive was conducted.  We also initiated a machine-learning analysis of mouse proteomic data to identify targets or pathways that may be involved in both the generation of radiation-related fatigue and rescue through taltirelin.    - HPCIO is working with Dr. Timothy Myers of NIAID to develop a laboratory information management system (LIMS) that can more effectively organize the NIAID Genomic Technology Sections (GTS) project and experiment data and workflow. The new LIMS being developed facilitates the standardization and management of procedures, workflows, and data management for NIAID investigators experiments with next-gen sequencing data, to enhance tracking of relevant information in each step and to improve reproducibility of results and identification of operational issues. Modules have been developed to automate and streamline GTSs custom project and experiment creation workflow.  We envision that this system can serve as a model and be readily customized for other labs with similar needs.  HPCIO also adapted this LIMS for Dr. John Tsang and Dr. Craig Martens of NIAID as demonstration projects for their respective labs.  - In collaboration with NINDS Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit, HPCIO is helping develop novel methods of analyzing single-cell RNAseq data collected from mice undergoing treatment for spinal injuries. We are working with NINDS researchers to help understand the pathways involved during spinal cord injury and healing.   - HPCIO is working with NCI Occupational & Environmental Epidemiology Branch to develop methodologies to incorporate occupational risk factors into epidemiological models. We are enlarging the training data to improve our novel classifiers for coding free text job descriptions into the 840 codes of the 2010 U.S. Standard Occupational Classification System.  Our classifier is being embedded within the data collection software of the NCI Agriculture Health Study, a large scale epidemiological study, to automatically code job descriptions as they are entered by study participants.  - In collaboration with the Membrane Transport Biophysics Section of NINDS, HPCIO is 1) developing  a computational tool to accurately identify the boundaries of the lysosomes in fluorescence microscopy and 2) using the fluorescence ration to measure lysosomal pH within each organelle for better understanding of the lysosomal pH regulation.    - A freely available plasmid database that is inter-operable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The Plasmid Manager offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki is a community-driven Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. Many features and external contents have been incorporated over the last few years to make it easier for users to extract different kinds of information from the wiki.  We are actively adding new data to the system to allow users to discern the origin of proteins found in saliva, whether they may come from the different salivary glands or from blood plasma, for instance.  Current efforts also include working with major stakeholders to engage with the research community and to gather feedback from them.  - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process. A Web-based automated referral tool, called ART, was developed and deployed to help PIs and SROs to identify the most relevant study section(s) or special emphasis panel(s) based on the scientific content of an application. In addition, HPCIO is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review. HPCIO has developed a system to capture the sentiment of reviewer comments in quick feedback surveys and classify these comments with sentiment score into broad categories.   In 2019, HPCIO continued to maintain ART and retrain the machine-learning models to reflect new and changing study sections.  In support of the ARGO initiative, we represented study sections through Word2Vec and generated distance metrics as well as diagrams, allowing leadership to analyze the relationship between study sections.

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9747967,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,514129,0.0074779678177551
"NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they may also contain personally identifiable information (PII) that make those clinical reports classified as PHI, which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all instances of PII in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents, which would no longer be classified as PHI and can be used in clinical research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses artificial intelligence methods including pattern recognition and computational linguistic techniques to recognize words and other alphanumeric tokens denoting PII (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and replace them with labels such as NAME and ADDRESS. In this way, both patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application called NLM Scrubber, which is capable of de-identifying many types of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design is based on both deterministic and probabilistic artificial intelligence methods utilizing large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the input reports are formatted as HL7 messages, the application software leverages patient information embedded in HL7 segments to find such information in the text portion of the HL7 message.  NLM Scrubber has been downloaded by a number of organizations for testing and use, including IBM, Google, Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Florida International University, University of Bristol, University College Dublin, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with the state cancer registries working with NCI have also been voiced their interests in using NLM Scrubber to de-identify narrative pathology reports in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.  Our current focus is making NLM-Scrubber answer various needs of clinical scientists and clinical data managers without a deep understanding of the underlying technology. In this term, we improved run-time performance of the system and provided a graphical user interface for easier use. Our users can now provide white and black lists of terms to better preserve clinical information and to better preserve patient privacy, respectively. In the new version of NLM-Scrubber, the users can also preserve certain allowable PII, producing the so-called Limited Data Sets.   While NLM-Scrubber can be used for de-identifying all clinical reports repository-wide, it can also be used in various modes tailored to the user and their context, including on-demand cohort-specific de-identification and de-identification with patient and provider identifiers. NLM-Scrubber enables clinical scientists, the users of de-identified data, to be part of the process and shape the de-identification output based on their needs. n/a",NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,10016024,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dictionary', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Methods', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Names', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personally Identifiable Information', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SEER Program', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'base', 'cohort', 'college', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'repository', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,918126,0.025433010088018123
"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community. Standards​ ​for​ ​scientific​ ​methods​ ​reporting​ ​are​ ​absolutely​ ​critical​ ​to​ ​producing​ ​reproducible​ ​science,​ ​but​ ​meeting such​ ​standards​ ​is​ ​difficult.​ ​Checklists​ ​and​ ​instructions​ ​are​ ​tough​ ​to​ ​follow​ ​often​ ​resulting​ ​in​ ​low​ ​and​ ​inconsistent compliance.​ ​To​ ​support​ ​new​ ​standards​ ​in​ ​methods​ ​reporting,​ ​especially​ ​the​ ​RRID​ ​standard​ ​for​ ​Rigor​ ​and Transparency,​ ​we​ ​propose​ ​to​ ​build​ ​​Sci-Score​​ ​a​ ​text​ ​mining​ ​based​ ​tool​ ​suite​ ​to​ ​help​ ​authors​ ​meet​ ​the​ ​standard.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9765194,R44CA206782,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'migration', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2019,238768,0.0024811505952710795
"Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications SemRep exploits UMLS knowledge resources to identify semantic predications and is made available to the research community as a stand-alone system. Current SemRep research and development involves enhancing linguistic processing for increased accuracy as well as migrating its codebase to Java for more efficient development. SemRep additionally supports two other resources that we provide to the research community. SemMedDB is a PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications extracted from biomedical abstracts (more than 98 million predications as of December 31, 2018). Semantic MEDLINE is a web application that combines semantic predications with document retrieval, abstractive summarization, and visualization techniques and allows users to navigate the biomedical literature using concepts and relations between them. These resources have been widely used as the basis for practical tasks, such as identification of drug interactions and adverse effects, hypothesis generation, and literature-based discovery. Current work on SemMedDB focuses on providing more contextual information about the semantic predications in SemMedDB, including their rhetorical category (IMRAD), factuality status, and evidence level. We are also exploring different distribution options for SemMedDB, such as neo4j graph database and RDF triplestore, to provide new aggregation and reasoning capabilities.  Recently, we have also been using information extraction methods more broadly to assess scientific rigor and translatability of biomedical research, in collaboration with extramural researchers. For example, a recent study focused on automatic recognition of limitations in clinical research literature. A current study aims to assess adherence of clinical trial publications to CONSORT reporting guidelines for increased transparency and reproducibility. Other work in this area includes extraction of study characteristics (e.g., species, models, interventions, outcomes) from PubMed abstracts to allow a large-scale unbiased analysis of variables relevant to translatability of pre-clinical animal studies, as well as fine-grained citation analysis for enhanced bibliometrics. n/a",Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications,10016944,ZIALM010012,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Bibliometrics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Extramural Activities', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Object Relations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'empowered', 'information organization', 'pre-clinical', 'repository', 'research and development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web app']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2019,1184679,0.06520370053717198

The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9607599,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,559237,0.0854502682105535

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Synonyms pose another challenge for high quality relevance searches. This is a problem for ordinary words, but it is even more of a difficult for entities that can be named in a number of different ways. LitVar address this problem for genetic variants. For example, searching for one of A146T, c.436G>A, or rs121913527 also finds instances of the other two. The goal is to extend this ability to other entity types.  We participated in The CHEMPROT track at BioCreative VI, which aims to assess the state of the art in automatically extracting the chemicalprotein relations in running text (PubMed abstracts). We proposed an ensemble of three systems, including a support vector machine, a convolutional neural network, and a recurrent neural network. Their output is combined using majority voting or stacking for final predictions. Our system obtained 0.7266 in precision and 0.5735 in recall for an F-score of 0.6410 during the challenge, achieving the highest performance among all team submissions during the challenge.  In addition to tackling relation extraction tasks with supervised machine-learning methods, we proposed a novel adversarial learning algorithm for unsupervised domain adaptation tasks where no labeled data are available in the target domain. We show domain invariant features can be learned in the latest neural networks such that classifiers trained for one relation type (proteinprotein) can be re-purposed to others (drugdrug). Compared to prior convolutional and recurrent NN-based relation classification methods without domain adaptation, we achieve improvements as high as 30% in F1-score. To further assist NLP tasks without pre-existing training data, we developed ezTag, a web-based annotation tool that allows users to perform annotation and provide training data with humans in the loop. ezTag supports both abstracts in PubMed and full-text articles in PubMed Central.  Negative and uncertain medical findings are frequent in radiology reports, but discriminating them from positive findings remains challenging for information extraction. Here, we propose a new algorithm, NegBio, to detect negative and uncertain findings in radiology reports. Unlike previous rule-based methods, NegBio utilizes patterns on universal dependencies to identify the scope of triggers that are indicative of negation or uncertainty. We evaluated NegBio on four datasets, including two public benchmarking corpora of radiology reports, a new radiology corpus that we annotated for this work, and a public corpus of general clinical texts. Evaluation on these datasets demonstrates that NegBio is highly accurate for detecting negative and uncertain findings and compares favorably to the current state of the art.   One promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we applied automated deep learning techniques to the literature triage process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog for genomic variation by collaborating with their database curators. Both the manual curation teams confirmed that our method achieved higher precision than their previous query-based triage methods without compromising recall. Both results show that our method is more efficient and can replace the traditional query-based triage methods of manually curated databases. Our method can give human curators more time to focus on more challenging tasks such as actual curation as well as the discovery of novel papers/experimental techniques to consider for inclusion.  Deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies as shown above in FY18. In addition to its applications in natural language processing, we have also seen its success in our medical image analysis such as processing chest X-ray images and colors fundus photographs. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,9796762,ZIALM091813,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evaluation', 'Fundus', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Supervision', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Voting', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'deep learning', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'human-in-the-loop', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'text searching']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,2254860,0.03491869078901427
"Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review Project Summary  1 More than 4,000 systematic reviews are performed each year in the fields of environmental health and evidence-based  2 medicine, with each review requiring, on average, between six months to one year of effort to complete. One of the most  3 time consuming and repetitive aspects of this endeavor involves extraction of detailed information from a large number  4 of scientific documents. The specific data items extracted differ among disciplines, but within a given scientific domain,  5 certain data points are extracted repeatedly for each review conducted. Research on use of natural language processing  6 (NLP) for extracting individual data elements has shown that it has the potential to greatly reduce the laborious, time  7 intensive, and repetitive nature of this step. However, there is currently no integrated, automatic data extraction platform  8 that meets the needs of the systematic review community. We propose a web-based data extraction software platform  9 specifically designed for usage in the domain of systematic review. By combining multiple state-of-the-art data extraction 10 methods utilizing NLP, text mining and machine learning, into a single, unified user interface, we will thereby empower 11 the end-user with a powerful and novel tool for automating an otherwise arduous task. 12 The research we propose encompasses three specific aims: (1) develop new data extraction models using deep learning 13 and a new technique called “data programming”; (2) develop a web-based platform to semi-automate the process; (3) 14 design protocols and standards for packaging extraction models as software components and integrating work done by 15 other research groups and vendors. In the first aim, we will contribute novel data extraction modules designed and 16 trained specifically to extract data elements of interest to those conducting systematic reviews in the domain of 17 environmental health. For this research, we will employ state-of-the-art machine learning, NLP and text mining 18 methodologies to train and evaluate several novel extraction components. In our second aim, we will develop a web- 19 based workbench which will allow users to upload scientific documents for automated data extraction. Our system will 20 also be designed to allow for integration of data extraction approaches (components) from other research groups, thus 21 enabling end users to choose from a wide variety of advanced data extraction methodologies within one unified and 22 intuitive software environment. In our third aim, we will develop new protocols to standardize the inputs and outputs 23 for data extraction components. The resulting interface, which will enable seamless integration of third party extraction 24 components into the workbench, will also facilitate the incorporation of feedback from users such that extraction 25 components can be continuously improved based on real-time data. 26 Our overarching goal is to translate emerging semi-automated extraction technologies out of the lab and into practical 27 software and to bring to market both the software itself as well as several premium data extraction components. The 28 results of the research conducted for Aims 1-3 represent the first step in this direction and will provide the foundation for 29 future developments. These result will take us one step closer to the dream of creating “living systematic reviews,” which 30 are maintained using automated or semi-automated methods and updated regularly as new evidence becomes available. Project Narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a flexible, extensible software system that automates the crucial and resource-intensive process of extracting key data elements from scientific documents, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.","Research and development of an open, extensible, web-based information extraction workbench for systematic review",9623091,R43ES029901,"['Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dreams', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'model design', 'novel', 'research and development', 'software systems', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R43,2018,225000,0.01750109270562428
"Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question The Repository for Informed Decision Making, Clinical Question Answering and Consumer Health Question Answering projects are addressing the above objectives by developing knowledge-based and machine learning approaches to extraction and structuring of information in biomedical literature and other types of text (such as clinical notes and registered clinical trials) for the following types of information: 1) the diseases and conditions; 2) the numbers, co-morbidities, and socio-demographic characteristics of study subjects/participants, such as species, gender, smoking status and alcohol consumption; 3) the therapeutic and diagnostic interventions; 4) the study and publication types; 5) the end-points and the outcomes of the studies; 6) drug interactions and 7) adverse drug reactions.  In FY2018, we have developed a number of approaches to facilitate understanding information requests sent to NLM customer services and long queries submitted to MedlinePlus search engine. Information requests sent to customer services are often several paragraphs long and provide the background and context that the customers believe will help understand their needs. For example, customers often describe several generations of their families affected by a disease and ask if their children will have it. The long MedlinePlus queries consist of one or two sentences and are often formed as questions. Both of these request forms are usually ungrammatical and rife with misspellings, abbreviations and informal language. We have developed a spellchecker for consumer language that is performing adequately on the misspellings important to understanding of the needs. After correcting spelling, our system employs three modules: a knowledge-based and a supervised machine learning method to understand the main points of the request, such as the disease or a drug of interest and the type of information about it. The systems extract the main points, which we found are sufficient to automatically search MedlinePlus and find authoritative and relevant pages for 65% of the requests. The third approach is to find similar questions that already have authoritative answers, e.g., provided by NIH institutes. In FY2018, the prototype consumer health question answering system became publicly available at https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/  Our clinical question answering system is based on the framework for asking well-formed questions developed by the evidence-based medicine experts. Their analysis showed that presenting a clinical information need as four-part question frame: patient characteristics/problem; planned intervention; comparison; and desired outcome, helps formulate search engine queries that lead to relevant results. We developed methods for automatic extraction of question frames from information requests, automatic query formulation and automatic extraction of answers from retrieval results. The LHC CQA1.0 system extracts the bottom-line advice from biomedical publications and aligns the question frames and the answers to find the best answer. The CQA 1.0 system is currently used to support development of evidence-based care plans at the NIH Clinical Center, to provide bottom-line for retrieved images in the LHC Open-i system and to provide summaries of the biomedical articles in the LHC Open Summarizer. n/a",Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question,9787046,ZIALM010009,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Services', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'evidence base', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'repository', 'search engine', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,531236,0.04199447693757258
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages.

"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9565646,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'process optimization', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability', 'web services', 'web-based tool']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,293252,0.035552763557899165
"Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science Over the past year, we have been active in: (1) developing computationally efficient methods and algorithms to solve known problems in the analysis of biomedical and clinical data and study complex interactions in biological systems; (2) developing knowledge-based data management systems for the discovery and curation of biomedical knowledge, including distributed annotation systems and laboratory information management systems;  (3) applying predictive-analytic models to scientific and administrative domains; and (4) consulting with NIH leadership to provide evidence-based solutions to improve the grant application and review process.  Specifically, in 2018, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following:  - In a partnership with Dr. John Tsang of the NIAID Laboratory of Systems Biology, HPCIO is conducting a multifaceted project to profile the immune system using the latest high-throughput, multiplexed technologies and systems approaches. One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop novel computational methodologies that can exploit inter-subject heterogeneity and measurements at various scales to assess the roles of the immune system in health and disease.  Currently, we are developing a multi-level linear model utilizing ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from monogenic disease patients to dissect the gene regulatory network.  The results will provide insights on the impacts specific genetic lesions have on downstream genes and how they are manifested at the clinical phenotypical level.   - HPCIO has entered into a wide-ranging collaboration to provide data science support and innovation to Dr. Leorey Saligan and the Symptom Management Branch of NINR.   An existing effort to identify radiotherapy-related fatigue genes from a PCR assay of oxidative stress using machine-learning methods has largely been completed.   In addition, a number of new efforts were initiated in 2018.   To provide guidance for future scRNA experiments to identify clusters of cells and their marker genes associated with wound healing in mice, an analysis of a similar experiment deposited to the Sequence Read Archive was conducted.  We also initiated a machine-learning analysis of mouse proteomic data to identify targets or pathways that may be involved in both the generation of radiation-related fatigue and rescue through taltirelin.    - As a pilot for a potential future service offering across NIH, HPCIO is working with Dr. John Tsang of NIAID to develop a laboratory information management system (LIMS) that can more effectively capture data associated with a large number of assays performed at the Center for Human Immunology (CHI). The CHI-LIMS will facilitate the standardization and management of procedures and workflows for various types of high-throughput assays, to enhance tracking of relevant information in each step and to improve reproducibility of results and identification of operational issues.  Modules will be developed to ensure interoperability with other NIH research information systems.  We envision that this system can serve as a model and be readily customized for other labs with similar needs.  - In collaboration with NINDS Spinal Circuits and Plasticity Unit, HPCIO is helping develop novel methods of analyzing single-cell RNAseq data collected from mice undergoing treatment for spinal injuries. We are working with NINDS researchers to help understand the pathways involved during spinal cord injury and healing.   - HPCIO is working with NCI Occupational & Environmental Epidemiology Branch to develop methodologies to incorporate occupational risk factors into epidemiological models. We are enlarging the training data to improve our novel classifiers for coding free text job descriptions into the 840 codes of the 2010 U.S. Standard Occupational Classification System.  Our classifier is being embedded within the data collection software of the NCI Agriculture Health Study, a large scale epidemiological study, to automatically code job descriptions as they are entered by study participants.  - In collaboration with the Membrane Transport Biophysics Section of NINDS, HPCIO is 1) developing  a computational tool to accurately identify the boundaries of the lysosomes in fluorescence microscopy and 2) using the fluorescence ration to measure lysosomal pH within each organelle for better understanding of the lysosomal pH regulation.    - A freely available plasmid database that is inter-operable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The Plasmid Manager offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki is a community-driven Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. Many features and external contents have been incorporated over the last few years to make it easier for users to extract different kinds of information from the wiki.  We are actively adding new data to the system to allow users to discern the origin of proteins found in saliva, whether they may come from the different salivary glands or from blood plasma, for instance.  Current efforts also include working with major stakeholders to engage with the research community and to gather feedback from them.  - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process. A Web-based automated referral tool, called ART, was developed and deployed to help PIs and SROs to identify the most relevant study section(s) or special emphasis panel(s) based on the scientific content of an application. In addition, HPCIO is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review. HPCIO has developed a system to capture the sentiment of reviewer comments in quick feedback surveys and classify these comments with sentiment score into broad categories.   In 2018, HPCIO continued to maintain ART and retrain the machine-learning models to reflect new and changing study sections.  In support of the ARGO initiative, we represented study sections through Word2Vec and generated distance metrics as well as diagrams, allowing leadership to analyze the relationship between study sections.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9521525,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,356845,0.03933964340673515
"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9545836,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2018,569784,0.03370153768861098
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.         We hypothesize that realizing the potential of biomedical natural language processing applied to full text journal articles to make a sustained and powerful contribution to biomedical research requires contextualizing Biomedical natural language processing in the daily life of bench scientists, focusing on their unmet information gathering needs, and providing interfaces that fit well into existing research workflows.

"NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they may also contain personally identifiable information (PII) that make those clinical reports classified as PHI, which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all instances of PII in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents, which would no longer be classified as PHI and can be used in clinical research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses artificial intelligence methods including pattern recognition and computational linguistic techniques to recognize words and other alphanumeric tokens denoting PII (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and replace them with labels such as NAME and ADDRESS. In this way, both patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application called NLM Scrubber, which is capable of de-identifying many types of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design is based on both deterministic and probabilistic artificial intelligence methods utilizing large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the input reports are formatted as HL7 messages, the application software leverages patient information embedded in HL7 segments to find such information in the text portion of the HL7 message.  NLM Scrubber has been downloaded by a number of organizations for testing and use, including IBM, Google, Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Florida International University, University of Bristol, University College Dublin, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with the state cancer registries working with NCI have also been voiced their interests in using NLM Scrubber to de-identify narrative pathology reports in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Our current focus is making NLM-Scrubber answer various needs of clinical scientists and clinical data managers without a deep understanding of the underlying technology. While NLM-Scrubber can be used for de-identifying all clinical reports repository-wide, it can also be used in various modes tailored to the user and their context, including on-demand cohort-specific de-identification and de-identification with patient and provider identifiers. NLM-Scrubber enables clinical scientists, the users of de-identified data, to be part of the process and shape the de-identification output based on their needs. n/a",NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,9787041,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dictionary', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Methods', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Names', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Personally Identifiable Information', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'base', 'cohort', 'college', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient privacy', 'repository', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,830057,0.022694600167235204
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays. This project will develop a formal process and integrated tools to support the complete cycle of tasks and decisions required for bioassay annotation, enabling expedited (and more cost-effective) drug discovery.","Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols",9527186,U01LM012630,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'FAIR principles', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Hour', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Librarians', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polishes', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubChem', 'Publishing', 'Readability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug mechanism', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'informatics training', 'novel', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'practical application', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,516810,0.0074779678177551
"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice. Our primary overarching goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate our findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support.

"Sci-Score, a tool suite to support Rigor and Transparency NIH and Journal Guidelines Project​ ​Summary While standards in reporting of scientific methods are absolutely critical to producing reproducible science, meeting such standards is tedious and difficult. Checklists and instructions are tough to follow often resulting in low and inconsistent compliance. Scientific journals and societies as well as the National Institutes of Health are now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods,​ ​but​ ​the​ ​trickier​ ​part​ ​is​ ​to​ ​train​ ​the​ ​biomedical​ ​community​ ​to​ ​use​ ​these​ ​standards​ ​to​ ​effectively. To support new standards in methods reporting, especially the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the standard. Sci-Score will provide an automated check on compliance with the RRID standard already implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife and other Rigor and transparency standards put forward by the NIH. The innovation behind Sci-score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators or journals. This score reflects an aspect of quality of methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators can use to compete with themselves​ ​and​ ​each​ ​other,​ ​the​ ​way​ ​they​ ​currently​ ​compete​ ​on​ ​metrics​ ​of​ ​popularity,​ ​i.e.,​ ​the​ ​H-index. In Phase I of this project and before, our group has successfully developed a text mining algorithm that can detect antibodies, cell lines, organisms and digital resources (all 4 RRID types) and has created a preliminary score. We propose to extend this approach to all research inputs, like chemicals and plasmids that are requested as part of Cell press’ STAR Methods (http://www.cell.com/star-methods)​. We also propose to build a set of algorithms to detect whether authors discuss the major sources of irreproducibility outlined by NIH, including investigator blinding, proper randomization and sufficient reporting of sex and other biological variables. Resource identification along with other quality metrics will be used to score the quality of scientific methods section text. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the​ ​quality​ ​of​ ​the​ ​scientific​ ​paper. Our Phase II specific aims include 1) enhancing and hardening the core natural language processing pipelines to recognize a broader range of sentences in near real time; 2) building a set of modular tools that will be provided for different groups of users to take advantage of the text mining capability we develop in aim 1. At the end of Phase II, we should have a commercially viable product that will be able to be licensed to serve the needs​ ​of​ ​the​ ​publishers​ ​and​ ​the​ ​broader​ ​research​ ​community.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9532909,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'bioinformatics resource', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2018,365327,0.005290753841961306
"Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services Over the last decade, the online search for biological information has progressed rapidly and has become an integral part of any scientific discovery process. Today, it is virtually impossible to conduct R&D in biomedicine without relying on the kind of Web resources developed and maintained by the NCBI. Indeed, each day millions of users search for biological information via NCBIs online Entrez system. However, finding data relevant to a users information need is not always easy in Entrez. Improving our understanding of the growing population of Entrez users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by NCBI.   Among all Entrez databases, PubMed is the most used one and often serves as an entry point for people to access related data in other Entrez databases. One source for understanding and characterizing patrons of search engines is the transaction logs. Our previous investigation of PubMed query logs has led us to develop and deploy several useful applications in assisting user searches and retrieval such as the query formulation in PubMed, namely Related Queries, Query Autocomplete and Author Name Disambiguation. Inspired by its success, we have continued using log analysis to identify research problems which are closely related to NCBI operations.    Many users only look at the first page of search results. With the growing usage of mobile devices, even fewer search results may be seen. While PubMeds traditional inverse date-order results meets the needs of many, improving Best Match results provides quick access to relevant results. In addition to search terms in the title and abstract, these results are based on the length of the query, the journal, the publication date, and whether other users clicked on the article.  A first step in providing relevant results is understanding the query. To better understand queries, we developed a Field Sensor to completely identify the portions and aims of a query. In other words, we identify which part of the query is an author name, a journal title, a date, or key phrases describing a knowledge the searcher would like to uncover. One use for this tool is reminding those looking for information, not specific articles, about our improved Best Match searching.  It would seem like queries to obtain a particular article would be the easiest to process. But when one considers the bewildering array of reference formats, and a users partial and incomplete memory, properly handling a single citation query is more difficult than one might think. Our approach was to match portions of a query to the bibliographic material of a clicked article. From these patterns, artificial queries could be constructed following patterns seen in actual queries. Since any number of these artificial queries could be constructed, there was plenty of data to inform and train an algorithm.  Helping the user enter the query they really want is also valuable. Query auto completion is a commonly available feature in search engines that helps users enter queries quickly, efficiently, accurately, and prompts for useful detail the searcher may not have not originally thought to include. The usual algorithm for these completions is the most popular completion, because popular queries are popular. However, this is not as useful in a scientific context. Scientists instead are often looking for the novel, the unknown, and the unseen. Using a personalized language model, time-sensitive data, neural nets, and a beam search for diversity we were able to better predict actual future queries. This could let to better query auto completion.  Some phrases carry more meaning than is obvious from the words in the phrase. Identifying these phrases in queries and documents helps identify the most relevant documents. But these phrases cannot be obtained by simply collecting known lists of good phrases. Creative researchers coin and use new phrases all the time. A way of identifying these phrases by comparing an articles title and body has been developed. The value of this approach has been confirmed by the large number of known phrases identified. But it also identifies phrases not yet recognized by curated lists. When any of these phrases are recognized in a query and then used in the search, the results are better than merely searching for the words individually.  Deep Learning and Neural Networks have shown their value in image processing for some time. Now their application in text processing is becoming more important. Several of our projects use word embeddings, or even neural nets directly. One challenge is having models efficient enough to scale for use in a high capacity search engine. By focusing on the differences between vectors describing a query and vectors describing a document, we have developed a system that could contribute to a relevance ranking algorithm.  Another approach directly compares the vectors for words in the query and words in the documents. Using an algorithm motivated by Word Movers Distance, it provides results better than traditional information retrieval methods. Moreover, when combined with those traditional approaches, the combined approach is superior to either single method.  Now that the full text of more and more articles is available, we want to use the full text to improve search. That is harder than might be expected because authors usually do a good job of summarizing their work in the abstract. A major hurdle is the lack of humanly annotated relevance data. One project showed MeSH terms which overlap with queries can be used as a proxy for direct human relevance judgements. n/a",Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services,9796755,ZIALM000001,"['Algorithms', 'Bibliography', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Coin', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Services', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Link', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Names', 'Occupations', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'handheld mobile device', 'image processing', 'improved', 'learning network', 'novel', 'online resource', 'operation', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'search engine', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'vector', 'virtual', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,1691145,0.02459100657511546
"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications SemRep exploits UMLS knowledge resources to identify semantic predications and is made available to the research community as a stand-alone system. Current SemRep research and development involves enhancing linguistic processing for increased accuracy as well as migrating its codebase to Java for more efficient development. SemRep additionally supports two other resources that we provide to the research community. SemMedDB is a PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications extracted from biomedical abstracts (more than 94 million predications as of December 31, 2017). Semantic MEDLINE is a web application that combines semantic predications with document retrieval, abstractive summarization, and visualization techniques and allows users to navigate the biomedical literature using concepts and relations between them. These resources have been widely used as the basis for practical tasks, such as identification of drug interactions and adverse effects, hypothesis generation, and literature-based discovery. Current work on SemMedDB focuses on providing more contextual information about the semantic predications in SemMedDB, including their rhetorical category (IMRAD), factuality status, and evidence level. We are also exploring different distribution options for SemMedDB, such as graph databases and RDF triplestores, to provide new aggregation and reasoning capabilities.  Recently, we have also been using information extraction methods more broadly to assess scientific rigor and translatability of biomedical research, in collaboration with extramural researchers. A recent study focused on automatic recognition of limitations in clinical research literature. A follow-up study aims to assess adherence of clinical trial publications to CONSORT reporting guidelines for increased reproducibility. Other work in this area includes extraction of study characteristics (e.g., species, models, interventions, outcomes) from PubMed abstracts to allow a large-scale unbiased analysis of variables relevant to translatability of pre-clinical animal studies, as well as fine-grained citation analysis for enhanced bibliometrics. n/a",Semantic Relation Extraction from Biomedical Text - Methods and Applications,9787047,ZIALM010012,"['Adherence', 'Adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Bibliometrics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug Interactions', 'Extramural Activities', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health Professional', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Object Relations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'empowered', 'information organization', 'pre-clinical', 'repository', 'research and development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'web app']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2018,885394,0.0689035192593379
"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9407024,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2018,395628,0.033320780705216484

"Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question The Repository for Informed Decision Making, Clinical Question Answering and Consumer Health Question Answering projects are addressing the above objectives by developing knowledge-based and machine learning approaches to extraction and structuring of information in biomedical literature and other types of text (such as clinical notes and registered clinical trials) for the following types of information: 1) the diseases and conditions; 2) the numbers, co-morbidities, and socio-demographic characteristics of study subjects/participants, such as species, gender, smoking status and alcohol consumption; 3) the therapeutic and diagnostic interventions; 4) the study and publication types; 5) the end-points and the outcomes of the studies; 6) drug interactions and 7) adverse drug reactions.  In FY2017, we have developed a number of approaches to facilitate understanding information requests sent to NLM customer services and long queries submitted to MedlinePlus search engine. Information requests sent to customer services are often several paragraphs long and provide the background and context that the customers believe will help understand their needs. For example, customers often describe several generations of their families affected by a disease and ask if their children will have it. The long MedlinePlus queries consist of one or two sentences and are often formed as questions. Both of these request forms are usually ungrammatical and rife with misspellings, abbreviations and informal language. We have developed a spellchecker for consumer language that is performing adequately on the misspellings important to understanding of the needs. After correcting spelling, our system employs three modules: a knowledge-based and a supervised machine learning method to understand the main points of the request, such as the disease or a drug of interest and the type of information about it. The systems extract the main points, which we found are sufficient to automatically search MedlinePlus and find authoritative and relevant pages for 65% of the requests. The third approach is to find similar questions that already have authoritative answers, e.g., provided by NIH institutes.  Our clinical question answering system is based on the framework for asking well-formed questions developed by the evidence-based medicine experts. Their analysis showed that presenting a clinical information need as four-part question frame: patient characteristics/problem; planned intervention; comparison; and desired outcome, helps formulate search engine queries that lead to relevant results. We developed methods for automatic extraction of question frames from information requests, automatic query formulation and automatic extraction of answers from retrieval results. The LHC CQA1.0 system extracts the bottom-line advice from biomedical publications and aligns the question frames and the answers to find the best answer. The CQA 1.0 system is currently used to support development of evidence-based care plans at the NIH Clinical Center, to provide bottom-line for retrieved images in the LHC Open-i system and to provide summaries of the biomedical articles in the LHC Open Summarizer. n/a",Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question,9554461,ZIALM010009,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Services', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'base', 'evidence base', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'search engine', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2017,436325,0.041869436116946004
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9275458,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2017,210198,0.04564867093355833
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9326367,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Community Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'process optimization', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability', 'web services', 'web-based tool']",NLM,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,293503,0.035552763557899165
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature is beginning to realize its potential for improving literature search, automating biological data curation, and enabling large scale studies not possible otherwise. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   In FY17, we continued the development of our own text mining tools for named entity recognition and relation extraction. We first developed tmVar 2.0, an improvement on our previous tool for recognition of genetic variants and to normalize them to unique identifiers (dbSNP RSIDs). We validated our method by a benchmarking evaluation, where it compared favorably to the state of the art. We then applied our approach to the entire PubMed and demonstrated that combining text mining in manual database curation can greatly assist human efforts in prioritizing variants in genomic research.   Following the recognition of sequence variants, we created an extraction system for genotype-phenotype relationships. The method extracts disease-gene-variant triplets using machine learning approach that identifies the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from both the local context (same document) and global context (i.e. all of PubMed). The system was evaluated both by comparison with the entries in the human-curated database UniProt and using benchmark datasets, where it demonstrated a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results.   While aforementioned feature-based machine learning has been the most commonly used approach for text mining for some time, deep learning methods are rapidly being adopted due to their improved performance and the reduced need for feature engineering. We created a novel deep learning model (McDepCNN) for extracting protein-protein interactions, which uses multiple channels to combine information from each word with information from the head of the corresponding word. The method is thus capable of capturing long distance features, and was shown to achieve 24.4% relative improvement in F1-score over the existing methods on cross-corpus evaluation and 12% improvement in F1-score over kernel-based methods on difficult instances.   In addition to pure methodological work, we also developed several systems which combined novel methodologies and applications with potential clinical importance. We developed the DIGNiFi (Disease causing GeNe FInder) method using machine learning and features extracted from protein-protein interaction networks to identify disease causing genes. We evaluated our method using 1184 known disease genes from 128 orphan diseases collected from Orphanet, demonstrating our method to outperform existing methods for identifying disease-causing genes. We also demonstrated that combining the human-curated protein-protein interaction network with interactions text-mined from the biomedical literature results in an additional performance improvement.   Finally, to demonstrate the utility of text mining in creating knowledge bases for large-scale studies, we created a new database containing over 100,000 labeled chest X-rays (ChestX-ray8), by text mining the associated radiological reports for eight commonly occurring thoracic diseases. We further demonstrated that these diseases can be automatically detected and even spatially-located via a unified weakly supervised multi-label image classification and disease localization framework. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,9564628,ZIALM091813,"['Adopted', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Localized Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'PubMed', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Thoracic Diseases', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'protein protein interaction', 'rapid technique', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2017,1274300,-0.024443104330890995
"Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science Over the past year, we have been active in: (1) developing computationally efficient methods and algorithms to solve known problems in the analysis of biomedical and clinical data and study complex interactions in biological systems; (2) developing knowledge-based data management systems for the discovery and curation of biomedical knowledge, including distributed annotation systems and clinical information management systems;  (3) applying predictive-analytic models to scientific and administrative domains; and (4) consulting with NIH leadership to provide evidence-based solutions to improve the grant application and review process.  Specifically, in 2017, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following:  -In a partnership with Dr. John Tsang of the NIAID Laboratory of Systems Biology, HPCIO is conducting a multifaceted project to profile the immune system using the latest high-throughput, multiplexed technologies and systems approaches. One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop novel computational methodologies that can exploit inter-subject heterogeneity and measurements at various scales to assess the roles of the immune system in health and disease. We have collected samples from a large cohort of patients with immune-mediated monogenic diseases and are the in process of deeply phenotyping blood samples of these patients.  By studying the immune system of multiple monogenic, immune-mediated diseases, we will have the opportunities to infer cellular and molecular networks of the human immune system.  HPCIO is actively involved in the development of a database to record clinical information of patient visits and in the bioinformatics analyses of data generated from the project.  - HPCIO is working with NCI Occupational & Environmental Epidemiology Branch to develop methodologies to incorporate occupational risk factors into epidemiological models. We are enlarging the training data to improve our novel classifiers for coding free text job descriptions into the 840 codes of the 2010 U.S. Standard Occupational Classification System. Agreement between our classification system and expert coders is measured using SOC code agreement and exposure prediction from CANJEM, a job-exposure matrix of over 250 exposure agents developed by Jerome Lavoue at the University of Montreal.  We are also working with NCI to develop a two-stage mixed generalized linear model to predict lifetime occupation exposures to lead.  - In collaboration with the Membrane Transport Biophysics Section of NINDS, HPCIO is 1) developing  a computational tool to accurately identify the boundaries of the lysosomes in fluorescence microscopy and 2) using the fluorescence ration to measure lysosomal pH within each organelle for better understanding of the lysosomal pH regulation.    - A freely available plasmid database that is inter-operable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The Plasmid Manager offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - As high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology plays an important role in systematically identifying novel cancer driver mutations in genome-wide surveys, NGS data generation is rapidly increasing, currently accumulating at a rate of several terabytes of data every month at the Lymphoid Malignancies Section of NCI. In collaboration with the Louis Staudt Laboratory, a bioinformatics website is being developed containing useful tools for the analysis of the laboratory's Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma data. This website enables users with very little computer expertise to run their own analyses, as opposed to having a specialist run the analyses for them. Methodologies in parallelization and text searching have also been incorporated for returning the analysis results much more quickly and efficiently than before.  In 2017, a new dimension to this collaboration was the development of machine learning methods to identify somatic from germline mutations from NGS sequencing data.  Machine learning models have also been tested to identify subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, based on their features of gene aberrations.  - In collaboration with NIA and NCI, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on large biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. In this collaboration, we are developing a machine learning method that models the temporal nature of the longitudinal clinical data to predict the progression of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such machine learning method may also work well in prediction of high-dimensional time-series genomic data.  - The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki is a community-driven Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. Many features and external contents have been incorporated over the last few years to make it easier for users to extract different kinds of information from the wiki.  One of the latest enhancements is the integration of RNA-seq transcriptional and protein immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas.  This affords users the ability to weigh evidence generated by different, independent modalities, in addition to the original mass-spectrometry-based data, to assess the status of a protein.    - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process. A Web-based automated referral tool, called ART, was developed and deployed to help PIs and SROs to identify the most relevant study section(s) or special emphasis panel(s) based on the scientific content of an application. In addition, HPCIO is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review. HPCIO has developed a system to capture the sentiment of reviewer comments in quick feedback surveys and classify these comments with sentiment score into broad categories.   Progress has been made to identify needs and suggestions offered by the reviewers and to assign topic labels for these needs and suggestions.  In 2017, HPCIO began to explore appropriate topological network mapping diagrams of CSR study sections, superimposed with measures of scientific productivity for those study sections.  - In collaboration with the Office of Data Analysis Tools and Systems, NIH Office of Extramural Research, HPCIO has been developing a standard database update pipeline for NIH Topic Maps, originally developed by Dr. Ned Talley of NINDS.   This effort was concluded in 2017.  - In collaboration with NIAID, HPCIO has supported its release HT JoinSolver(R), a new application capable of analyzing V(D)J recombination in thousands of immunoglobulin gene sequences produced by high throughput sequencing. n/a","Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science",9550738,ZIHCT000200,"['Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Blood specimen', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant Review Process', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Genes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Linear Models', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant lymphoid neoplasm', 'Management Information Systems', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Epidemiology', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Published Comment', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translational Research', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'design', 'epidemiological model', 'evidence base', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning strategy', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'parallelization', 'programs', 'repository', 'research and development', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal', 'web site', 'wiki']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2017,2619784,0.019607081465329503
"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9306183,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,368201,0.03933964340673515

"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals).

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will address a critical and unmet need to conduct large-scale clinical research in drug-supplement interactions (DSIs) and improve evidence bases for healthcare practice.

"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9357656,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Genome', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'dashboard', 'improved', 'insight', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'prospective', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2017,572778,0.03370153768861098
"Sci-Score, a tool to support rigor and transparency guidelines Project Summary While  standards  in  reporting  of  scientific  methods  are  absolutely  critical  to  producing  reproducible  science,  meeting  such  standards  is  difficult.  Checklists  and  instructions  are  tough  to  follow  often  resulting  in  low  and inconsistent  compliance.  Scientific  journals  and  societies  as  well  as  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  are  now actively proposing general guidelines to address reproducibility issues, particularly in the reporting of methods  (e.g.,  http://www.cell.com/star-­methods),  but  the  trickier  part  will  be  to  train  the  biomedical  community  to  use these standards to effectively improve how scientific methods are communicated. To support new standards in methods reporting, specifically the RRID standard for Rigor and Transparency of  Key Biological Resources, we propose to build Sci-­Score a text mining based tool suite to help authors meet the  standard.  Sci-­Score  will  provide  an  automated  check  on  compliance  with  the  RRID  standard  already  implemented by over 100 journals including Cell, Journal of Neuroscience, and eLife. The innovation behind Sci-­ score is the provision of a score, which can be obtained by individual investigators, which reflects a numerical  validation of the quality of their methods reporting. We posit that the score will serve as a tool that investigators  and journals can use to compete with themselves and each other, or in the very least allow them to see how  close they are to the average in meeting quality requirements.   Recently, our group has developed a text mining algorithm that has now been successfully been used to detect software tools and databases from the SciCrunch Registry in published papers. Digital tools are one of four resource types that the RRID standard identifies. We propose to extend this approach to the other types of entities: antibodies, cell lines and model organisms. Resource identification along with other quality metrics twill be used to train an algorithm to score the overall quality of the methods document. If successful, the tool could be used by editors, reviewers, and investigators to improve the number of RRIDs, therefore the quality of descriptors of key biological resources in published papers. This SBIR project will build a set of algorithms similar to the resource finding pipeline and develop it into an industrial robust and reconfigurable software system. Our Phase I specific aims include to 1) creating gold sets of data for each resource type and training a set of algorithms for each resource type; 2) designing and evaluating the scoring system; 3) designing and evaluating a report generating system based on the previous aims.

"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web. These combined efforts will accelerate basic understanding of disease processes and discovery of diagnostic targets and more effective individualized therapies.",Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery,9326315,U01GM120953,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Europe', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Fostering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Play', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Post-Translational Regulation', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'collaborative environment', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'enzyme substrate', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'hackathon', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge integration', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'system architecture', 'text searching', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal', 'web services', 'web site']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,U01,2017,370434,0.005290753841961306

"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,9193091,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Planet Earth', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'digital', 'electronic book', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2017,396248,0.033320780705216484

"Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services Over the last decade, the online search for biological information has progressed rapidly and has become an integral part of any scientific discovery process. Today, it is virtually impossible to conduct R&D in biomedicine without relying on the kind of Web resources developed and maintained by the NCBI. Indeed, each day millions of users search for biological information via NCBIs online Entrez system. However, finding data relevant to a users information need is not always easy in Entrez. Improving our understanding of the growing population of Entrez users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by NCBI.   Among all Entrez databases, PubMed is the most used and often serves as an entry point for people to access related data in other databases.One resource for understanding and characterizing patrons of PubMed search engines is its transaction logs. Our previous investigation of PubMed search logs has led us to develop and deploy several useful applications in assisting user searches and retrieval such as the query formulation in PubMed, namely Related Queries, Query Autocomplete and Author Name Disambiguation.   Inspired by past success, we have continued using log analysis to improve access to NCBI resources. For example, we have used user clicks to identify articles that the user considered relevant to their own query. In 2016-2017, we have used deep learning models to understand the relationship between the query and the content of potentially relevant articles. This approach is robust and outperforms both traditional IR algorithms as well as related shallow and deep models based on continuous representations of text, with better results on the under-specified query and term mismatch problems.  Of course, there are multiple factors that indicate whether an article is relevant to the searcher. These include the connection between the query and the content, how recent the article is, whether other people found the article relevant, etc. PubMeds new Best Match sort order (using a Learning to Rank algorithm) combines a number of different scores and sources of information to identify the most relevant queries. This has significantly improved the results of our relevance rankings since Spring 2017.   We are continuing the effort begun by our work on TermVariants. When a term is used in a query, usually documents using equivalent terms are also desired. A seeming trivial example is singular and plural terms. But care must be taken to avoid irrelevant articles. For example, navely applying plural rules to abbreviations is often not helpful. Guidelines are being developed to show where these expansions will be helpful.  To better understand queries, we developed a Field Sensor to completely identify the portions and aims of a query. In other words, we identify which part of the query is an author name, a journal title, a date, or key phrases describing a knowledge the searcher would like to uncover. One practical use for this tool is reminding those looking for information, not specific articles, about our improved relevance searching.  We continue to improve our handling and understanding of author names in PubMed articles. Principle Investigators on NIH-funded grants make a particularly important subset of PubMed authors. Additional information about these authors is available from their grants. Information about published papers in grants allows us to do a better job connecting papers and authors. These authors can be more reliably identified between different institutional affiliations, across changes in research focus and even connect different names for the same author. n/a",Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services,9564626,ZIALM000001,"['Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Improve Access', 'Information Services', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Names', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Population', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Text', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'improved', 'online resource', 'phrases', 'research and development', 'search engine', 'sensor', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2017,1606260,0.027145827444409555
"Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science Over the past year, we have been active in: (1) developing computationally efficient methods and algorithms to solve known problems in the analysis of biomedical and clinical data and study complex interactions in biological systems; (2) developing knowledge-based data management systems for the discovery and curation of biomedical knowledge, including distributed annotation systems and clinical information management systems;  (3) applying predictive-analytic models to scientific and administrative domains; and (4) consulting with NIH leadership to provide evidence-based solutions to improve the grant application and review process.  Specifically, in 2016, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following:  - In a partnership with Dr. John Tsang of the NIAID Laboratory of Systems Biology, HPCIO is conducting a multifaceted project to profile the immune system using the latest high-throughput, multiplexed technologies and systems approaches. One of the goals of this collaboration is to develop novel computational methodologies that can exploit inter-subject heterogeneity and measurements at various scales to assess the roles of the immune system in health and disease.  In a cohort of more than 1,000 patients who went through gastric bypass surgeries, we have developed an approach to deconvolve individual populations of immune cell subsets in complex tissues based on tissue gene expression data.  Associations between the immune cell populations and clinical traits were measured to understand the roles these immune cells play in response to obesity-driven signals. In another aspect of the collaboration, we have compared the chromatin accessibility of fresh and cryopreserved samples of four immune cell types from health donors.  The results from ATAC-seq analyses indicate subtle but interesting changes after cells have been frozen, and may have implication to the practicality of using cryopreserved samples in assessing the regulatory landscape of gene expression in the cells.  - HPCIO is working with NCI Occupational & Environmental Epidemiology Branch to develop methodologies to incorporate occupational risk factors into epidemiological models. We are enlarging the training data to improve our novel classifiers for coding free text job descriptions into the 840 codes of the 2010 U.S. Standard Occupational Classification System. Agreement between our classification system and expert coders is measured using SOC code agreement and exposure prediction from CANJEM, a job-exposure matrix of over 250 exposure agents developed by Jerome Lavoue at the University of Montreal.  We are also working with NCI to develop a two-stage mixed generalized linear model to predict lifetime occupation exposures to lead.  - In collaboration with the Membrane Transport Biophysics Section of NINDS, HPCIO is 1) developing  a computational tool to accurately identify the boundaries of the lysosomes in fluorescence microscopy and 2) using the fluorescence ration to measure lysosomal pH within each organelle for better understanding of the lysosomal pH regulation.    - A freely available plasmid database that is inter-operable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The Plasmid Manager offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - As high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology plays an important role in systematically identifying novel cancer driver mutations in genome-wide surveys, NGS data generation is rapidly increasing, currently accumulating at a rate of several terabytes of data every month at the Lymphoid Malignancies Section of NCI. In collaboration with the Louis Staudt Laboratory, a bioinformatics website is being developed containing useful tools for the analysis of the laboratorys Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma data. This website enables users with very little computer expertise to run their own analyses, as opposed to having a specialist run the analyses for them. Methodologies in parallelization and text searching have also been incorporated for returning the analysis results much more quickly and efficiently than before.  - In collaboration with NIA and NCI, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on large biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. In this collaboration, we are developing a machine learning method that models the temporal nature of the longitudinal clinical data to predict the progression of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such machine learning method may also work well in prediction of high-dimensional time-series genomic data.  - The Human Salivary Proteome Wiki is a community-driven Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. Many features and external contents have been incorporated over the last few years to make it easier for users to extract different kinds of information from the wiki.  One of the latest enhancements is the integration of RNA-seq transcriptional and protein immunohistochemistry data from the Human Protein Atlas.  This affords users the ability to weigh evidence generated by different, independent modalities, in addition to the original mass-spectrometry-based data, to assess the status of a protein.    - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process. A Web-based automated referral tool, called ART, is being developed to help PIs and SROs to identify the most relevant study section(s) or special emphasis panel(s) based on the scientific content of an application. In addition, HPCIO is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review. This effort includes evaluating a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing free text from peer reviewers on their perception of the study section quality. If successful, the pilot results will be used to as initial input for a full-scale implementation.  - In collaboration with the Office of Data Analysis Tools and Systems, NIH Office of Extramural Research, HPCIO has been developing a standard database update pipeline for NIH Topic Maps, originally developed by Dr. Ned Talley of NINDS.   We are preparing this pipeline for incorporation into a stable hosted instance and hope to go live in late 2016.  - In collaboration with NIAID, HPCIO has released HT JoinSolver(R), a new application capable of analyzing V(D)J recombination in thousands of immunoglobulin gene sequences produced by high throughput sequencing.  - Based on its experience in building novel models for classifying research grants and projects, HPCIO has collaborated with several ICs to develop the Portfolio Learning Tool, a comprehensive classification workflow system that will allow users to select from multiple classification algorithms, feature spaces, and training regimes, to build and run their own classifiers. HPCIO has developed an augmented support vector machine (SVM) that augments a training set by sampling from a corpus of unknowns and runs a large ensemble on various samples of this augmented space. The results obtained from this classifier suggest that, when coupled with an effective annotation strategy, such a classifier can be quite effective at categorizing a research portfolio. n/a","Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science",9344251,ZIHCT000200,"['ATAC-seq', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Exposure to', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant Review Process', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Genes', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant lymphoid neoplasm', 'Management Information Systems', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Occupational Epidemiology', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Strategic Planning', 'Study Section', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translational Research', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'epidemiological model', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning strategy', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'parallelization', 'peer', 'programs', 'repository', 'research and development', 'response', 'software development', 'terabyte', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal', 'web site', 'wiki']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2016,2034266,0.023552675058915562
"Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) promises to transform the way that physicians treat their patients, resulting in better quality and more consistent care informed directly by the totality of relevant evidence. However, clinicians do not have the time to keep up to date with the vast medical literature. Systematic reviews, which provide rigorous, comprehensive and transparent assessments of the evidence pertaining to specific clinical questions, promise to mitigate this problem by concisely summarizing all pertinent evidence. But producing such reviews has become increasingly burdensome (and hence expensive) due in part to the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base, hampering our ability to provide evidence-based care.  If we are to scale EBM to meet the demands imposed by the rapidly growing volume of published evidence, then we must modernize EBM tools and methods. More specifically, if we are to continue generating up-to-date evidence syntheses, then we must optimize the systematic review process. Toward this end, we propose developing new methods that combine crowdsourcing and machine learning to facilitate efficient annotation of the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. These annotations will comprise mark-up of sections of text that discuss clinically relevant fields of importance in EBM, such as discussion of patient characteristics, interventions studied and potential sources of bias. Such annotations would make literature search and data extraction much easier for systematic reviewers, thus reducing their workload and freeing more time for them to conduct thoughtful evidence synthesis.  This will be the first in-depth exploration of crowdsourcing for EBM. We will collect annotations from workers with varying levels of expertise and cost, ranging from medical students to workers recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. We will develop and evaluate novel methods of aggregating annotations from such heterogeneous sources. And we will use the acquired manual annotations to train machine learning models that automate this markup process. Models capable of automatically identifying clinically salient text snippets in full-text articles describing clinical trials would be broadly useful for biomedical literature retrieval tasks and would have impact beyond our immediate application of EBM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop crowdsourcing and machine learning methods to annotate clinically important sentences in full-text articles describing clinical trials Ultimately, we aim to automate such annotation, thereby enabling more efficient practice of evidence- based medicine (EBM).         ",Crowdsourcing Mark-up of the Medical Literature to Support Evidence-Based Medicine and Develop Automated Annotation Capabilities,9076888,UH2CA203711,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Automated Annotation', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Students', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Source', 'System', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'demographics', 'detector', 'dosage', 'evidence base', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'phrases', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,UH2,2016,240650,0.04564867093355833

"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice. Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,9127807,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'community based participatory research', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'lexical', 'programs', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,362613,0.03933964340673515
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research. Fortunately, advances in biomedical natural language processing and increasing access to digital full text journal publications offer the potential for innovative new approaches to delivering relevant information to working bench scientists.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. To assess the state of the art in biomedical entity recognition and relation extraction, we organized a science competition at BioCreative V, an international challenge event for evaluating advances in text mining research for biology. Specifically, we designed two challenge tasks: disease named entity recognition (DNER) and chemical-induced disease (CID) relation extraction. To assist system development and assessment, we created a large annotated text corpus that consisted of human annotations of chemicals, diseases and their interactions from 1500 PubMed articles. 34 teams worldwide participated in the CDR task: 16 (DNER) and 18 (CID). The best systems achieved an F-score of 86.46% for the DNER task--a result that approaches the human inter-annotator agreement (0.8875)--and an F-score of 57.03% for the CID task, the highest results ever reported for such tasks. Given the level of participation and team results, we found our task to be successful in engaging the text-mining research community, producing a large annotated corpus and improving the results of automatic disease recognition and CDR extraction.  In addition to organizing the BioCreative task, we continued our own development of biomedical named entity taggers in 2015-2016. First and foremost, we created a general toolkit called TaggerOne: the first machine learning model for joint named entity recognition and normalization. TaggerOne is an all-purpose tagger (i.e. not specific to any entity type), requiring only annotated training data and a corresponding lexicon, and has been optimized for high throughput. We validated TaggerOne with multiple gold-standard corpora containing both mention- and concept-level annotations. Its results compare favorably to the previous state of the art, notwithstanding the greater flexibility of the model. TaggerOne is implemented in Java and its source code has been made publicly available to the research community.   However, large-scale use of open-source tools sometimes requires a significant investment in infrastructure and maintenance time. These investments not only impair the continued adoption of text mining tools, but also reduce the ability of individual researchers to explore applying text mining to problems in their research area. In contrast, Web services provide on-demand access to software tools through the Internet using straightforward interfaces and data formats. Providing text mining tools as web services therefore reduces the bar to use for biocurators and bioinformatics researchers not working specifically in text mining, allowing free exploration and the ability to focus on results rather than methodology.  Therefore, in 2015 we developed NCBI text-mining web services, an online version of our text mining tool suite for biomedical concept recognition and information extraction. Our service incorporates multiple state of the art tools for identifying critical entity types: DNorm (for diseases), GNormPlus (genes and proteins), SR4GN (species), tmChem (chemicals and drugs), and tmVar (variants). Our web service has already processed over 60 million requests since its inception from researchers in 46 countries, supporting research projects in biocuration, crowdsourcing and translational bioinformatics. We anticipate that providing text mining tools as web services will greatly expand their utility to the biomedical research community.  Finally, as mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we continued to improve our previous curation-assisting tool  PubTator  and to collaborate with domain experts: human database curators in this case. With these efforts, our PubTator system is continuously being used in the production curation pipeline of two external databases on a daily basis:  1. HuGE Navigator  a CDCs knowledgebase of human genome epidemiology  2.

"An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata PROJECT ABSTRACT Biomedical investigators are generating increasing amounts of complex and diverse data. This data varies tremendously, from genome sequences through phenotypic measurements and imaging data. If researchers and data scientists can tap into this data effectively, then we can gain insights into disease mechanisms and how to tackle them. However, the main stumbling block is that it is increasingly hard to find and integrate the relevant datasets due to the lack of sufficient metadata. A researcher studying Crohn's disease may miss a crucial dataset on how certain microbial communities affect gut histology due to the lack of descriptive tags on the data. Currently, applying metadata is difficult, time-consuming and error prone due to the vast sea of confusing and overlapping standards for each datatype. Often specialized `data wranglers' are employed to apply metadata, but even these experts are hindered by lack of good tools. Here we propose to develop an intelligent agent that researchers and data wranglers can use to assist them apply metadata. The agent is based around a personalized dashboard of metadata elements that can be collected from multiple specialized portals, as well as sites such as Wikipedia. These elements can be coupled with classifiers that can be used to self-identify datasets to which they may be relevant, making the selection of appropriate vocabularies easier for researchers. We will deploy the system for a number of targeted use cases, including annotation of the National Center for Biomedical Information Bio-Samples repository, and annotation of images within the Figshare repository. Project Narrative Biomedical data is being generated at an increasing rate, and it is becoming increasingly difficult for researchers to be able to locate and effectively operate over this data, which has negative impacts on the rate of new discoveries. One solution is to attach metadata (data about data) onto all information generated in a research project, but application of metadata is currently difficult and time consuming due to the diverse range of standards on offer, typically requiring the expertise of trained data wranglers. Here we propose to develop an intelligent concept assistant that will allow researchers to generate and share sets of metadata elements relevant to their project, and will use machine learning techniques to automatically apply this to data.",An Intelligent Concept Agent for Assisting with the Application of Metadata,9161233,U01HG009453,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Disease', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Frustration', 'Histology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sea', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'dashboard', 'empowered', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'microbial community', 'peer', 'repository', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,U01,2016,575532,0.03370153768861098
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.",In silico identification of phyto-therapies,9123422,R01LM011963,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Automated Annotation', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biodiversity', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Botanicals', 'Chemicals', 'Civilization', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnobotany', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Opinion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hepatitis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Island', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Library Science', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuals', 'Medicinal Plants', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Products', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Plants', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'PubChem', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Samoan', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trees', 'Universities', 'Vermont', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical application', 'computer infrastructure', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'indexing', 'literature citation', 'meetings', 'novel therapeutics', 'prostratin', 'success', 'synthetic drug', 'tool', 'vector']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,419732,0.04059973080779473
"Semantic Literature Annotation and Integrative Panomics Analysis for PTM-Disease Knowledge Network Discovery PROJECT SUMMARY Protein post-translational modification (PTM) plays a critical role in many diseases; however, critical gaps remain in research infrastructure for global analysis of PTMs. Key PTM information concerning enzyme- substrate relationships, regulation of PTM enzymes, PTM cross-talk, and functional consequences of PTM remains buried in the scientific literature. Meanwhile, while high-throughput panomics (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, PTM proteomic) data offer an unprecedented opportunity for the discovery of PTM-disease relationships, the data must be analyzed in an integrated and easily accessible knowledge framework in order for researchers and clinicians to gain a molecular understanding of disease. The goal of this application is to develop a collaborative knowledge environment for semantic annotation of scientific literature and integrative panomics analysis for PTM-disease knowledge discovery in precision medicine. We propose to connect PTM information from literature mining and curated databases in a knowledge resource on an ontological framework that supports analysis of panomics data in the context of PTM networks. To broaden impact and foster collaborative development, our resource will be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and interoperable with community standards.  The specific aims are: (i) develop a novel NLP (natural language processing) system for full-scale literature mining and PTM-disease knowledge extraction; (ii) develop a PTM knowledge resource for integrative panomics analysis and network discovery; and (iii) provide a FAIR collaborative environment for scalable semantic annotation and knowledge integration. The proposed system will build upon the NLP technologies and text mining tools already developed by our team and the bioinformatics infrastructure at the Protein Information Resource (PIR). The iPTMnet web portal will allow searching, browsing, visualization and analysis of PTM networks and PTM-related mutations in conjunction with user-supplied omics data, including panomics data from major national initiatives. Use scenarios will include identification of disease-driving genetic variants and analysis of cellular responses to kinase inhibitors. Our PTM knowledgebase will be disseminated with an RDF triple-store and a SPARQL endpoint for semantic queries, while our text mining tools and full-scale literature mining results will be disseminated in the BioC community standard for seamless integration to other text mining pipelines. To engage the community semantic annotation of scientific literature, we will host a hackathon to develop tools to expose BioC-annotated literature corpora to the semantic web, as well as an annotation jamboree to explore tagging of scientific text with precise ontological terms. This project will thus offer a unique research resource for PTM-disease network discovery as well as an integrable collaborative knowledge framework to support Big Data to Knowledge in precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Precision medicine requires a detailed understanding of the molecular events that are disrupted in disease, including changes in protein post-translational modifications (PTM) that are hallmarks of many diseases. The proposed resource will support analysis of genomic-scale data for exploring PTM-disease networks and PTM-related mutations, as well as knowledge dissemination on the semantic web.

"Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research Capitalizing on the transformative opportunities afforded by the extremely large and ever-growing volume, velocity, and variety of biomedical data being continuously produced is a major challenge. The development and increasingly widespread adoption of several new technologies, including next generation genetic sequencing, electronic health records and clinical trials systems, and research data warehouses means that we are in the midst of a veritable explosion in data production. This in turn results in the migration of the bottleneck in scientific productivity into data management and interpretation: tools are urgently needed to assist cancer researchers in the assembly, integration, transformation, and analysis of these Big Data sets. In this project, we propose to develop the Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research (SDL-BR) system, a cluster-computing software environment that enables rapid data ingestion, multifaceted data modeling, logical and semantic querying and data transformation, and intelligent resource discovery. SDL-BR is based on the idea of a data lake, a distributed store that does not make any assumptions about the structure of incoming data, and that delays modeling decisions until data is to be used. This project adds to the data lake paradigm methods for semantic data modeling, integration, and querying, and for resource discovery based on learned relationships between users and data resources. The SDL-BR System is a distributed computing software solution that enables research institutions to manage, integrate, and make available large institutional data sets to researchers, and that permits users to generate data models specific to particular applications. It uses state of the art cluster computing, Semantic Web, and machine learning technologies to provide for rapid data ingestion, semantic modeling and querying, and search and discovery of data resources through a sophisticated, Web-based user interface.",Semantic Data Lake for Biomedical Research,9200905,R44CA206782,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immigration', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cluster computing', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'handheld mobile device', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'melanoma', 'natural language', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'success', 'systems research', 'targeted treatment', 'technology development', 'time use', 'tool']",NCI,"INFOTECH SOFT, INC.",R44,2016,221175,0.0024811505952710795
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support.

"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans.

Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8840267,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2015,490160,0.10778673763658511
"Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science The Informatics, Machine Learning, and Biomedical Data Science, which operates within the High Performance Computing and Informatics Office (HPCIO), Division of Computational Bioscience of CIT, is collaborating with NIH investigators to build a critical mass in text and numerical analytics that is envisioned to encompass a number of pertinent and related disciplines in biomedical research including semantic interoperability, computational linguistics, text and data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, longitudinal analysis, and visualization.  The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, genomics, proteomics, systems biology, ""big data"" analysis, and portfolio analysis.  In 2015, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following:  -In collaboration with NIA, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on large biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. In this collaboration, we are developing a machine learning method that models the temporal nature of the longitudinal clinical data to predict the progression of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Such machine learning method may also work well in prediction of high-dimensional time-series genomic data.  - In collaboration with NIAID, HPCIO has released HT JoinSolver(R), a new application capable of analyzing V(D)J recombination in thousands of immunoglobulin gene sequences produced by high throughput sequencing.  - HPCIO is working with NCI to develop methodologies to incorporate occupational risk factors into epidemiological models. Novel classifiers are being developed to classify free text job descriptions into the 840 codes of the 2010 U.S. Standard Occupational Classification System.  Agreement between our classification system and expert coders is measured using SOC code agreement and exposure agreement after applying CANJEM, a job-exposure matrix of over 250 exposure agents developed by Jrme Lavou at the University of Montreal.  - In collaboration with the Membrane Transport Biophysics Section NINDS, HPCIO is 1) developing a tool to accurately identify the boundaries of the lysosomes in fluorescence microscopy and 2) using the fluorescence ration to measure lysosomal pH within each organelle for better understanding of the lysosomal pH regulation.  - HPCIO is collaborating with NIAID to study immune cell infiltration in various tissue samples from patients with metabolic diseases. Using systems-based approaches, we examine gene expression and genotyping data to understand the roles and interactions of different immune cells in response to metabolic disease signals and their associations to intervention outcomes and other phenotypes.    - A freely available plasmid database that is interoperable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The Plasmid Manager offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process. A Web-based automated referral tool, called ART, is being developed to help PIs and SROs to identify the most relevant study section(s) or special emphasis panel(s) based on the scientific content of an application. In addition, HPCIO is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review. This effort includes evaluatinng a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing free text from peer reviewers on their perception of the study section quality. If successful, the pilot results will be used to as initial input for a full-scale implementation.  - The Human Salivary Protein wiki has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - In collaboration with the Office of Data Analysis Tools and Systems, NIH Office of the Director, HPCIO has been developing a standard database update pipeline for NIH Topic Maps, originally developed by Dr. Ned Talley of NINDS.   We are evaluating whether this pipeline can be incorporated into a stable hosted instance.  - As high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology plays an important role in systematically identifying novel cancer driver mutations in genome-wide surveys, NGS data generation is rapidly increasing, currently accumulating at a rate of several terabytes of data every month at the Lymphoid Malignancies Section of NCI. We need to enhance database platforms in anticipation of even more growth in the near future. The recent emergence of Hadoop/NoSQL systems (e.g., Hbase) has provided an alternative platform for querying large-scale genomic data. In addition, relational database providers have been enhancing their offerings to include products for explicitly distributing data across multiple nodes (e.g., Postgres XL). We have sought to integrate these technologies with current relational database systems (e.g., Postgres) to improve performance in a parallel or distributed manner. The goal of our effort has been to investigate the potential of these distributed platforms in storing and querying the large volumes of data that NCI accumulates, thereby augmenting their current analytical capabilities.  - Based on its experience in building novel models for classifying research grants and projects, HPCIO has collaborated with DPCPSI/OD and other ICs to develop the Portfolio Learning Tool, a comprehensive classification workflow system that will allow users to select from multiple classification algorithms, feature spaces, and training regimes, to build and run their own classifiers.  HPCIO has developed an augmented support vector machine (SVM) that augments a training set by sampling from a corpus of unknowns and runs a large ensemble on various samples of this augmented space. The results obtained from this classifier suggest that, when coupled with an effective annotation strategy, such a classifier can be quite effective at categorizing a research portfolio. n/a","Informatics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science",9146134,ZIHCT000200,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant Review Process', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin Genes', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant lymphoid neoplasm', 'Management Information Systems', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Salivary Proteins', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Engineering', 'Study Section', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translational Research', 'Transmembrane Transport', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'design', 'distributed data', 'epidemiological model', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'longitudinal analysis', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'peer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relational database', 'repository', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool', 'wiki']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2015,1941638,0.030897352285940607
"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature 1) Electronic Textbook and PubMed Central Indexing Current processing of the electronic textbook material involves a number of steps designed to produce the most meaningful phrases in the text to be used as reference points. The first task is to identify grammatically reasonable phrases. We use a version of the Brill transformation based tagger, rewritten in C++, for part-of- speech tagging. This forms the basis for determining grammatically reasonable phrases. There is a significant post processing step that removes phrases that involve inappropriate references to context (e.g., different cells, final mutation). After finding grammatically reasonable phrases we attempt to eliminate those that are too common or generic to be useful (e.g., significant result, short time).  The next step is to compare a phrase with previously rated phrases that have been collected over the life of the project. The final stage is to estimate the importance of a phrase in the passage where it is found in a textbook. Such an estimate is based on the frequency of the phrase and the size of the passage compared with the frequency of the phrase throughout the book and the overall size of the book. In order to improve such an estimate we attempt to take account of the phrase or any phrase that represents the same concept. For this purpose we use the UMLS Metathesaurus and also stemming and combine these two approaches into a consistent picture of the concept as it occurs in the text.  The result of this processing is a scored list of phrase-book section pairs for each textbook. These are used to guide the response of general searching in the books. When a user types in a phrase that is on our curated list the first results given are the highly rated book sections for that phrase. We are now applying a similar indexing scheme to the text of articles in PMCentral. This allows us to give a list of highly rated phrases for each article as an enhanced reference point for searchers.    2) A significant fraction of queries in PubMed are multiterm queries and PubMed generally handles them as a Boolean conjunction of the terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simply collections of terms. We have examined whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that classes of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differ from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. The important insight here for indexing is that in some cases where the words of a phrase occur in text, but not as the phrase, the phrase may still be an appropriate concept to use in indexing the text.   3) We have studied how good phrases can be recognized by their characteristics, such as frequency, tendency to be repeated in documents where they occur, and other numerical properties. These features allow one to predict which phrases are of high quality. We have found such predictions to be useful in studying different kinds of terms that may appear in text and how an ontoloogy might be extracted from text.  4) We have found stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with regularization by early stopping to be a very efficient method for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for MeSH term assignment. We have discovered that the early stopping can be implemented as stopping after a constant number of iterations and the results are as good as stopping based on held out data and also as good as more conventional methods of training an SVM on large data sets. The SGD approach is much faster and allows one to readily train classifiers for all 27,000 MeSH terms. Results are superior to previously published methods. The approach could be the basis of indexing suggestions for PubMed records or for an automatic concept assignment system similar to MeSH. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,9160928,ZIALM091711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'phrases', 'response', 'stem']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2015,122708,0.03512828181550006
"MACE2K - Molecular And Clinical Extraction: A Natural Language Processing Tool for Personalized Medicine ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The velocity, variety, volume and veracity of data from relevant information sources make it extremely challenging for oncologists to collect and review pertinent data that can support routine personalized treatment for their patients. There is an urgent need to develop data wrangling approaches including Natural Language Processing and information retrieval methods to extract and curate personalized-therapy related publications and clinical trials. Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop new computational methods and software to retrieve targeted molecular and drug therapy information from multiple sources of big data including: clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts, open access articles, and conference proceedings.

"Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lifespans continue to increase, chronic disease survival rates are drastically improved, and treatments are being discovered for a variety of illnesses. This rapidly changing scenario requires patients to participate in their recovery, understand written information and directions thereby calling upon patients to have increasingly more complex health literacy. However, time availability of practitioners or other resources to explain the required information has not increased to match. As a result, finding efficient means to improving patient health literacy is an increasingly important topic in healthcare. Increased health literacy may promote healthy lifestyle behaviors and increase access to health services by the population. It has been argued that for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to be successful, more effort is needed to increase the health literacy of millions of Americans. Similarly, the Healthy People 2020 statement by the Department of Health and Human Services identified improving health literacy (HC/HIT-1) as an important national goal. The broad- long term objectives of this project are to contribute to increasing the health literacy of patients and health information consumers and provide caregivers an evidence-based tool for simplifying text. The most commonly used tool for estimating the difficulty of text is the readability formula. They are not sufficient, however, because there is no evidence to support a connection between their use and decreases in difficulty. This problem is addressed by using modern resources and techniques for discovering traits that make health-related text difficult and developing a tool to guide the simplification of text. . There are four specific aims of this project: 1) Identify differentiating features of easy versus difficult texts, 2) Design a simplification strategy using computer algorithms, 3) Measure the impact of simplification on perceived and actual text difficulty with online participants and a representative community sample, 4) Create free, online software that incorporates proven features algorithmically. Corpus analysis will be conducted to compare easy and difficult texts with each other and discover lexical, grammatical, semantic, and composition and discourse features typical for each. Then, simplification algorithms will be designed and developed relying on rule-based techniques to leverage available resources, e.g., vocabularies, or on machine learning approaches for discovering the best combinations of features for simplification. A representative writer will simplify text by relying on the suggestios provided by an online that tool that uses simplification algorithms. The effect of simplification wll be tested in comprehensive user studies to evaluate the effect on both actual and perceived difficulty. Features successfully shown to decrease text difficulty will be incorporated in an onlie software program designed to reduce text difficulty.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary trait for a healthy population. Providing understandable information is critical but few tools exist to help write understandable text. We aim to discover features indicative of difficult text, design translation algorithms and create a free, online software tool for rewriting health-related text with demonstrated impact on perceived and actual text difficulty            ",Evidence-based Strategy and Tool to Simplify Text for Patients and Consumers,8884888,R01LM011975,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arizona', 'Behavior', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health behavior', 'Health education', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2020', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Mullerian duct inhibiting substance', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Readability', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Underserved Population', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Universities', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'college', 'combat', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health literacy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'lexical', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'volunteer']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,376917,0.03933964340673515
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evidence-based medicine (EBM) looks to inform patient care with the totality of available relevant evidence. Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of EBM and are critical to modern healthcare, informing everything from national health policy to bedside decision-making. But conducting systematic reviews is extremely laborious (and hence expensive): producing a single review requires thousands of person-hours. Moreover, the exponential expansion of the biomedical literature base has imposed an unprecedented burden on reviewers, thus multiplying costs. Researchers can no longer keep up with the primary literature, and this hinders the practice of evidence-based care.      The long term aim of this work is to develop computational tools and methods that optimize the practice of EBM. The proposed work thus builds upon our previous successful efforts developing computational approaches that reduce the workload in EBM. More speciﬁcally, we aim to develop tools that semi-automate the laborious task of data extraction - identifying and extracting the information of interest (e.g., trial sample size, interventions and outcomes) from the free-texts of biomedical articles - via novel machine learning methods. Semi-automating this task will drastically reduce reviewer workload, thus enabling the practice of EBM in an age of information overload.      Previous efforts to automate data extraction from articles describing clinical trials have shown promise, but lack the accuracy and scope necessary for real-world use. These approaches have been impeded by the absence of a large corpus of annotated clinical trials, and by the difﬁculty of constructing models to automatically extract all of the variables necessary for synthesis. We describe methodological innovations to overcome these hurdles. First, to train our machine learning models we propose leveraging large existing databases that contain structured information about clinical trials, in lieu of the usual approach of collecting expensive manual annotations. Practically, this means we will be able to exploit a very large `pseudo-annotated' dataset that is an order of magnitude bigger than what has been used in previous efforts, thus substantially improving model performance. Our extensive preliminary work demonstrates the promise and feasibility of this approach. Second, we propose novel machine learning models appropriate for the tasks of article categorization and data extraction for EBM. These models will speciﬁcally be designed to perform extraction of multiple, correlated data elements of interest while simultaneously classifying articles into clinically salient categories useful for EBM.      We will rigorously evaluate the developed methods to assess their practical utility, speciﬁcally y comparing automated extraction accuracy to that achieved by trained systematic reviewers. And to make these methods useful to end-users (systematic reviewers), we will develop and evaluate open-source software and tools, including a web-based extraction tool that integrates our machine learning models to automatically extract information from uploaded articles (PDFs). We will conduct a user study to evaluate the utility and usability of this tool in practice.             Public Health Narrative  We propose to develop computational methods and tools that make the practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) more efﬁcient, speciﬁcally by semi-automating data extraction from the full-texts of articles describing clinical trials. Such tools would drastically reduce the workload currently involved in producing evidence syntheses, ultimately enabling evidence- based care in an era of information overload.",Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews,9028559,R01LM012086,"['Age', 'Area', 'Beds', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Elements', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Services', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'study characteristics', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trial design', 'usability']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2015,317900,0.035552763557899165
"Bio Text NLP ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Since our last renewal, the challenges for biomedical researchers of keeping up with the scientific literature have become even more acute. Last year marked the first time that Medline indexed more than a million journal articles; more than 210,000 of these had full text deposited in PubMedCentral, bringing the total number of full texts archived in PMC to over 3 million. The stunning pleiotropy of genes and their products, combined with the adoption of genome-scale technologies throughout biomedical research, has made obsolete the notion that reading within one's own specialty plus a few ""top"" journals is enough to keep track of all of the results relevan to one's research.

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our recent research introduced a state-of-the-art system called DNorm for disease normalization based on pairwise learning to rank. In 2013-2014, we performed an investigation with regard to the different performance of DNorm when applied to clinical narratives vs. biomedical publications. We used closure properties to compare the richness of the vocabulary in clinical narrative text to biomedical publications. We found that while the size of the overall vocabulary is similar between clinical narrative and biomedical publications, clinical narrative uses a richer terminology to describe disorders than publications, which we believe to be one of the primary causes of reduced performance in clinical narrative. Accordingly, we introduced several lexical enhancements  generalizable to other clinical NLP tasks  that improved the ability of DNorm to handle this variation. The clinical version of DNorm (DNorm-C) is now made openly available to the research community, along with our other open source tools.  One common challenge in biomedical named entity recognition (NER) and normalization is the identification and resolution of composite named entities, where a single span refers to more than one concept (e.g., BRCA1/2). Previous NER and normalization studies have either ignored composite mentions, used simple ad hoc rules, or only handled coordination ellipsis, making a robust approach for handling multitype composite mentions greatly needed. In 2014-2015, we proposed a hybrid method integrating a machine-learning model with a pattern identification strategy to identify the individual components of each composite mention. Our method, which we have named SimConcept, is the first to systematically handle many types of composite mentions. The technique achieves high performance in identifying and resolving composite mentions for three key biological entities: genes (90.42% in F-measure), diseases (86.47% in F-measure), and chemicals (86.05% in F-measure). Furthermore, our results show that using our SimConcept method can subsequently improve the performance of gene and disease concept recognition and normalization.  As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we continued to improve our previous curation-assisting tool  PubTator  and to collaborate with domain experts: human database curators in this case. With these efforts, our PubTator system is now being used in the production curation pipeline of two external databases on a daily basis:  1. HuGE Navigator: a CDC knowledgebase of human genome epidemiology  2. SwissProt: an annotated database of protein sequence and functional information.   In 2014-2015, we also investigated the feasibility of using crowdsourcing for respectively assisting gene-mutation curation and drug-indication cataloging, given the high cost of expert annotation. In both studies, we first translated the complex expert-annotation task into human intelligence tasks (HITs) suitable for the average workers. For instance, instead of asking people to find drug indications from free text (e.g. lengthy paragraphs), we simplified the task such that each HIT only involved a worker making a binary judgment of whether a highlighted disease, in context of a given drug label sentence, is an indication. Then we recruited annotators from an unknown network of workers through the technical environment of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Judgments from the crowds were then aggregated to become the final answer. For evaluation, we assessed the ability of our proposed method to achieve high-quality annotations in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner. In comparison with the expert annotations, we find that our crowdsourcing approach not only results in significant cost and time saving, but also leads to accuracy comparable to that of domain experts. Therefore, we conclude that our crowdsourcing-based approach provides a readily scalable and cost-effective model to manual curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,9160930,ZIALM091813,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Biological', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lexical', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2015,409028,0.039738058279212826
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences. Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8906938,R00LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2015,217378,0.07507399117176936
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support.

"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Protégé to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Protégé generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.  Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems.

"HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aim of this proposal is to implement a novel way of processing and accessing the vast detailed knowledge contained within collections of scientific publications on the regulation of transcription initiation in bacterial models. In princple, this model for processing and reading information and new knowledge is applicable to other biological domains, potentially benefiting any area of biomedical knowledge. It is certainly criticl to generate new strategies to cope with the ever-increasing amount of knowledge generated in genomics and in biomedical research at large. Improving the efficiency of the traditional high-quality manual curation of scientific publications will enable us also to expand the type of biological knowledge, beyond mechanisms and their elements in the genome, to start including their connections with larger regulated processes and eventually physiological properties of the cell. We will first implement the necessary technology to improve our curation by means of a computational system that has text mining capabilities for preprocessing the papers before a human expert curator identifies which sentences contain the information that is to be added to the database. Premarked options selected by the curators will accelerate their decisions. The accumulative precise mapping between sentences and curated knowledge will provide training sets for text mining technologies to improve their automatic extraction. The curator practices will become more efficient, enabling us to curate selected high-impact published reviews to place mechanisms into a rich context of their physiological processes and general biology. Another relevant component of our proposal is the improved modeling of regulated processes by means of new concepts in biology that capture larger collections of coregulated genes and their concatenated reactions. Starting from all interactions of a local regulator, coregulated regulators and their domain of action will be incorporated to construct the biobricks of complex decisions, as they are encoded in the genome. These are conceptual containers that capture the organization of knowledge to describe the genetic programming of cellular capabilities. These proposals will be formalized and proposed within an international consortium focused in enriching standard models or ontologies of gene regulation for use by the scientific community. Finally, a portal to navigate across all the sentences of a given corpus of a large number (more than 5,000) of related papers will be implemented. The different avenues of navigation will essentially use two technologies, one dealing with automatically generating simpler sentences from original sentences as input, and the other one with the classification of papers based on their theme or ontology. Their combination will enable a novel navigation reading system. If we achieve our aims, this project will give a proof-of-principle prototype with clearly innovative higher levels of large amounts of integrated knowledge. Future directions may adapt these concepts and methods to the biology of higher organisms, including humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Scientific knowledge reported within publications provides a wealth of knowledge that we barely capture in databases for genomics. Enhancing the effectiveness of the processing and representation of all this knowledge will change the way we encode our understanding of concatenated interactions that are organized into networks and processes governing cell behavior. Given the conservation in evolution of the nature of biological complexity, a better encoding of our understanding of a bacterial cell shall influence that of any other living organism.            ",HIGH THROUGHPUT LITERATURE CURATION OF GENETIC REGULATION IN BACTERIAL MODELS,8817212,R01GM110597,"['Area', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Model', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Indium', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Reading', 'Regulation', 'Regulon', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'coping', 'digital', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'microbial community', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'promoter', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'software development', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'usability']",NIGMS,CENTER FOR GENOMIC SCIENCES,R01,2015,406247,0.033320780705216484
"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8734439,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2014,489755,0.10778673763658511
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8669161,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2014,212994,0.025115528173234317
"Text Analytics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science The Text Analytics, Machine Learning, and Biomedical Data Science, which operates within the Collaborative Research Office in Computer and Information Science (CROCIS), Division of Computational Bioscience of CIT, is collaborating with NIH investigators to build a critical mass in text and numerical analytics that is envisioned to encompass a number of pertinent and related disciplines in biomedical research including semantic interoperability, knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, text and data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization.  The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, genomics, proteomics, systems biology, ""big data"" analysis, and portfolio analysis.  In 2013, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following.  - In collaboration with NIAID, CROCIS is developing a new algorithm capable of analyzing V(D)J recombination in thousands of immunoglobulin gene sequences produced by high throughput sequencing.  - CROCIS is working with Melissa Friesen of NCI to develop methodologies to improve exposure classification in occupational epidemiologic studies. Initial effort of this collaboration involves a tool that helps experts to classify free-text job descriptions into standard occupational codes. Machine-learning based classification methods will also be utilized to help with evaluating exposure-disease associations.   - In collaboration with NINDS, CROCIS has implemented and compared several methods to locate and characterize lysosomes in 3-D fluorescence images.  The goal is to be able to calculate the pH of each lysosome in the image, for which the ability to resolve their locations is an important step.  - In collaboration with NIA, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on large biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. Omnimorph, a graphic data analysis tool, is being developed for multidimensional data visualization. In this collaboration, we are also developing a model to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease using plasma proteomic biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).  - Machine-learning methods have been devised and implemented to identify and refine transcription start sites in the fruit fly genome found using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE).  This effort is in collaboration with Brian Oliver of NIDDK.  - CROCIS is collaborating with NIAID in developing an image analysis pipeline to quantify individual transcript molecules in macrophage cells to help understand the molecular mechanism of macrophage adaptation to various stimuli at the single-cell level.  - A freely available plasmid database that is interoperable with popular freeware is currently being developed for the NIDA Optogenetics and Transgenic Technology Core. The plasmid database offers a versatile yet simple platform for scientists to store and analyze their plasmid data. Motivated by the need for a more comprehensive approach to archiving plasmid data, the database platform is enriched with numerous components beyond the repository, serving as an informatics platform designed to enhance the efficiency and analytic capabilities of scientists.   - In collaboration with CSR, CROCIS is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process.   The effort so far has concentrated on exploratory analysis against the NIH portfolio to evaluate clustering methods and assess intrinsic measures of cluster quality.  Content-based application referral tools are being developed to help evaluate the merit of PIs study section requests, and to recommend the most suitable study section for an application if no requests are made.  In addition, CROCIS is analyzing text from quick feedback surveys on peer review.  This effort includes evaluating a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of analyzing free text from peer reviewers on their perception of the study section quality.  If successful, the pilot results will be used to as initial input for a full-scale implementation.  - CROCIS has been collaborating with the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP), part of the NIH Common Fund, to develop the Common Assay Reporting System (CARS). CARS is an integrated system for managing bioassay information and facilitating communication between all the high-throughput screening centers within the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN). Goals for this collaboration include: 1) Track project status and related issues at each of the screening centers within the MLPCN, and provide the means for information collection, sharing and retrieval among the centers and the program office at NIH. 2) Establish a standardized protocol to describe raw data from the experiments and report screening data to the scientific community.  - The human salivary protein catalog has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by CROCIS, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - CROCIS investigators worked with the Office of Extramural Research (OER) on applying machine-learning methods to identify important terms that peer reviewers use to describe innovative applications.  The goal of the effort was to develop a lexicon of terms that can help estimate the innovation level of a grant application based on peer review critiques from the applications NIH Summary Statement.  - Although the scientific impact of NCI consortia on the advancement of cancer epidemiology research is understood to be significant, accurate quantitative metrics of this impact are needed by program leadership. We are developing methods to track citations to clinical guidelines in the context of evidence-based medicine that could provide funding agencies and program directors insight into individual consortia's contributions in advancing medical knowledge. This work is being conducted in collaboration with Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP), NCI.  - Based on its experience in building novel models for classifying research grants and projects, CROCIS is collaborating with DPCPSI/OD and other ICs to develop the Portfolio Learning Tool, a comprehensive classification workflow system that will allow users to select from multiple classification algorithms, feature spaces, and training regimes, to build and run their own classifiers.  A particular prototype of this system is being tailored to assist NCI Intramural investigators in reporting their research to the Annual Report system.  CROCIS has been developing an augmented support vector machine (SVM) that augments a training set by sampling  from a corpus of unknowns and runs a large ensemble on various samples of this augmented space. The results obtained from this classifier suggest that, when coupled with an effective annotation strategy, such a classifier can be quite effective at categorizing a research portfolio.  - The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) is conducting a pilot investigation in collaboration with CROCIS to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning models for the classification of five BSSR-relevant research categories. n/a","Text Analytics, Machine Learning & Biomedical Data Science",8941588,ZIHCT000200,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Annual Reports', 'Applications Grants', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease Association', 'Drosophila genome', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extramural Activities', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant Review Process', 'Guidelines', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Immunoglobulin Genes', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Information Sciences', 'Investigation', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melissa', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Bank', 'Mouth Diseases', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasmids', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Salivary Proteins', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Stimulus', 'Study Section', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cluster computing', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'macrophage', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'peer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'research study', 'screening', 'social science research', 'text searching', 'tool']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2014,2410320,0.032818388905598
"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8722030,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,260727,0.014132128590704505
"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature 1) Electronic Textbook and PubMed Central Indexing Current processing of the electronic textbook material involves a number of steps designed to produce the most meaningful phrases in the text to be used as reference points. The first task is to identify grammatically reasonable phrases. We use a version of the Brill transformation based tagger, rewritten in C++, for part-of- speech tagging. This forms the basis for determining grammatically reasonable phrases. There is a significant post processing step that removes phrases that involve inappropriate references to context (e.g., different cells, final mutation). After finding grammatically reasonable phrases we attempt to eliminate those that are too common or generic to be useful (e.g., significant result, short time).  The next step is to compare a phrase with previously rated phrases that have been collected over the life of the project. The final stage is to estimate the importance of a phrase in the passage where it is found in a textbook. Such an estimate is based on the frequency of the phrase and the size of the passage compared with the frequency of the phrase throughout the book and the overall size of the book. In order to improve such an estimate we attempt to take account of the phrase or any phrase that represents the same concept. For this purpose we use the UMLS Metathesaurus and also stemming and combine these two approaches into a consistent picture of the concept as it occurs in the text.  The result of this processing is a scored list of phrase-book section pairs for each textbook. These are used to guide the response of general searching in the books. When a user types in a phrase that is on our curated list the first results given are the highly rated book sections for that phrase. We are now applying a similar indexing scheme to the text of articles in PMCentral. This allows us to give a list of highly rated phrases for each article as an enhanced reference point for searchers.    2) A significant fraction of queries in PubMed are multiterm queries and PubMed generally handles them as a Boolean conjunction of the terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simply collections of terms. We have examined whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that classes of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differ from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. The important insight here for indexing is that in some cases where the words of a phrase occur in text, but not as the phrase, the phrase may still be an appropriate concept to use in indexing the text.   3) Currently we are studying how good phrases can be recognized by their characteristics, such as frequency, tendency to be repeated in documents where they occur, and other numerical properties. These features allow one to predict which phrases are of high quality. We have found such predictions to be useful in studying different kinds of terms that may appear in text and how an ontoloogy might be extracted from text.  4) We have found stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with regularization by early stopping to be a very efficient method for training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for MeSH term assignment. We have discovered that the early stopping can be implemented as stopping after a constant number of iterations and the results are as good as stopping based on held out data and also as good as more conventional methods of training an SVM on large data sets. The SGD approach is much faster and allows one to readily train classifiers for all 27,000 MeSH terms. Results are superior to previously published methods. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,8943238,ZIALM091711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'phrases', 'response', 'stem']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2014,103988,0.03768796684478234
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our recent research introduced a machine learning method called DNorm for normalization based on pairwise learning to rank. In 2013-2014, we have continued our efforts in improving DNorm by increasing its scalability through a dimension reduction technique based on low-rank matrix approximation. When assessed on our recently developed NCBI disease corpus, the new algorithm demonstrates a significant reduction in the number of parameters to be learned while maintaining a high accuracy.   Besides disease named entity recognition (NER), we also improved the state of the art in the chemical NER problem. Through participation of the BioCreative IV CHEMDNER task, we introduced the tmChem system, a chemical named entity recognizer created by combining two independent machine-learning models in an ensemble. We used the challenge task corpus to develop and evaluate tmChem, achieving a micro-averaged f-measure of 0.8739 on the mention-level evaluation, which is the highest performance among all participating teams.   To improve the interoperability among various biomedical text-mining tools our group has created over the years (e.g. DNorm, tmChem, tmVar, etc), we recently adopted a newly proposed community-wide scheme called BioC for handling heterogeneity and variety in data formats. Specifically, we modified our tools and enabled them to read/write data in the proposed BioC format. The resulting BioC wrapped toolkit, is named as tmBioC. Through empirical studies, we demonstrated that our tools in tmBioC can be more efficiently integrated with each other as well as with external tools: Our experimental results show that using BioC reduces >60% in lines of code for text-mining tool integration.   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we focused on Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, which is a common task among model organism database (MOD) groups. It is also a very time-consuming and labor-intensive task, thus often considered as one of the bottlenecks in literature curation. There is a growing need for semi- or fully-automated GO curation techniques that will help database curators rapidly and accurately identify gene function information in full-length articles. Despite multiple attempts in the past, few studies have proven to be useful with regard to assisting real-world GO curation. The lack of sentence-level training data and opportunities for interaction between text mining developers and GO curators has limited the advances in algorithm development and corresponding use in practical circumstances. To this end, we organized a text-mining challenge task for literature-based GO annotation in BioCreative IV. More specifically, we developed two sub-tasks: a) to automatically locate text passages that contain GO-relevant information (a text retrieval task) and b) to automatically identify relevant GO terms for the genes in a given article (a concept recognition task). With the support from five MODs, we provided teams with nearly 4,000 unique text passages that served as the basis for each GO annotation in our task data. Such evidence text information has long been recognized as critical for text-mining algorithm development but was never made available due to the high cost of curation. In total, seven teams participated in the challenge task. From the team results, we find an overall improvement in performance for recognizing GO terms when comparing to similar task results in the past. Future work should focus on improving performance of GO concept recognition and incorporating practical benefits of text-mining tools into real-world GO annotation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8943240,ZIALM091813,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'cost', 'data format', 'gene function', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'model organisms databases', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2014,831900,0.06553718594105228
"NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they usually also contain personal identifiers that are considered PHI, which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all of the identifiers in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents that can be used in research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques to recognize patient-related individually identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and redacts them. In this way, patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application that is capable of de-identifying many kinds of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design uses a number of deterministic and probabilistic pattern recognition algorithms and various computational linguistic methods as well as large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the reports are formatted as HL7 messages, the application leverages the labeled patient-related information embedded in various HL7 segments to find such information in the free text narrative.  The application software includes an editor for visualization and markup called the Visual Tagging Tool (VTT) that we use to produce gold standards against which to test the tool. Although designed specifically for tagging identifiers that contain personally identifiable, protected health information, VTT has been made publicly available to the greater NLP community for expanded lexical tagging and text annotation.  Our research tool has been performing quite well on identifiers containing personally identifiable information found on dictated reports. Our current focus is on extending our work to further improve our results across a large spectrum of identifiers and newer report types. The resulting software tool will be used to de-identify the entire BTRIS repository of clinical narrative reports. n/a",NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,8943232,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Dictionary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'improved', 'lexical', 'patient privacy', 'repository', 'tool', 'visual information']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2014,385331,0.01129719945855807
"Developing and applying information extraction resources and technology to create     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Building on 8 years of highly productive work in technology development that included the creation of the Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text corpus (CRAFT), we hypothesize that text mining resources and methods are approaching the level of maturity required to productively process a significant proportion of the full text biomedical literature to create a well-represented formal knowledge base of molecular biology. We propose a detailed, integrated plan to achieve this long-standing goal. Success in this effort will make possible a transformative new way for the biomedical research community to identify access and integrate existing knowledge, breaking down disciplinary boundaries and other silos that have kept scientists from fully exploiting relevant prior results in their research.      Our successes in the prior funding period broadened the applicability of biomedical concept identification systems to a much wider set of tasks, demonstrating the ability to target multiple community-curated ontologies in text mining, and generate scientifically significant insights from the results. The proposed work would take advantage of the resources we produced to transcend several of the limitations of previous efforts. We propose innovative new approaches to formal knowledge representation and to characterizing relationships between textual elements and semantic content. We will design, implement and evaluate computational systems that have the potential to transform enormous text collections into semantically rich, logic-based, standards-compliant, formal representations of biomedical knowledge with clearly identified provenance. The resulting representations will express complex assertions about a very wide range of entities, processes, qualities, and, most importantly, their specific relationships with one another.              Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Hunter, Lawrence E.

"In silico identification of phyto-therapies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Plants have been acknowledged as forming the basis of medicines dating back to the most ancient civilizations. To complement synthetic drug discovery processes, there remains a significant opportunity for identifying potential new therapies from plant-based sources (""phyto-therapies""). Current approaches used for the discovery of potential phyto-therapies are laborious, time-consuming, and mostly manual. The increased availability of ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge in digital formats suggests that there may be the potential to leverage automated techniques to facilitate the phyto-therapy discovery process. The long-term goal of this initiative is thus to develop a semantically integrated framework that could be used to identify and validate potential phyto-therapies embedded within ethnobotanical and biomedical knowledge sources, and thus encourage the conservation of this knowledge and biodiversity. The overall project is built around three major aims, which are to: (1) develop a standards-driven gold standard that can be used for benchmarking automated phyto-therapy identification approaches; (2) develop an automated approach to identify potential phyto-therapies from digitized biodiversity literature (Biodiversity Heritage Library), biomedical literature citations (MEDLINE) or digital full-text (PubMed Central), genomic (GenBank), clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov), and chemical (PubChem) resources; and (3) leverage vector space modeling techniques to predict the relevance of potential phyto-therapies. The success of this endeavor will set the stage for the translation of a growing, but currently disjointed, evidence-base of medicinal plant knowledge into tools for the elucidation of potential phyto-therapies. Furthermore, through achieving these aims, this project will also establish a first-of- its-kind in silico platform that could be extended to identify additional therapeutics from a broad spectrum of biodiversity sources. The core aspects of this project will build on experience with developing computational techniques to bridge biodiversity and biomedical knowledge, including those that have been pioneered by the research team.      This project will bring together biomedical informatics, library science, and ethnobotany experience and expertise from two institutions: the University of Vermont and The New York Botanical Garden. The multi- institutional and multi-PI aspects of this project support the feasibility of the proposed project aims and will furthermore enable the load-balancing of essential tasks such that they may meet the proposed milestones set for each aim. To this end, the success of the proposed endeavor will be built on a foundation of experiences in gathering ethnobotanical knowledge, analyzing and linking biodiversity and biomedical knowledge sources, and developing approaches for systematically annotating corpora for subsequent purposes in support of natural language processing and data mining pursuits.                RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH  The identification of potential therapies is a significant area of research with direct public health implications. As such, the integration of knowledge from traditionally disjoint knowledge sources may offer a more holistic view of the ethnobotanical and biomedical research knowledge that can support the development of new disease treatment regimens.

"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.             Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion.

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8714053,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,307471,0.06019871567871804
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.            ",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8628132,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'FaceBase', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'malformation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,525880,0.04939897857262152
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Prot¿g¿ user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems. This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.","Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us",8474789,R01GM095476,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Evaluation', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor-Rearrangement Excision DNA Circles', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical information system', 'biomedical scientist', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'response', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2013,486484,0.10778673763658511
"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8484438,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'screening', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,202118,0.025115528173234317
"Text Analytics, Machine Learning & High Performance Computing The Text Analytics, Machine Learning, and High Performance Computing Program, which operates within the High Performance Computing and Informatics Office (HPCIO), Division of Computational Bioscience of CIT, is collaborating with NIH investigators to build a critical mass in text and numerical analytics that is envisioned to encompass a number of pertinent and related disciplines in biomedical research including semantic interoperability, knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, text and data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization.  The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, genomics, proteomics, systems biology, ""big data"" analysis, and portfolio analysis.  In 2013, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following.  - In collaboration with NIAID, HPCIO developing a new algorithm capable of analyzing V(D)J recombination in thousands of immunoglobulin gene sequences produced by high throughput sequencing.  - HPCIO is working with Melissa Friesen of NCI to develop methodologies to improve exposure classification in occupational epidemiologic studies. Initial effort of this collaboration involves a tool that helps experts to classify free-text job descriptions into standard occupational codes. Machine-learning based classification methods will also be utilized to help with evaluating exposure-disease associations.   - In collaboration with NINDS, HPCIO has implemented and compared several methods to locate and characterize lysosomes in 3-D fluorescence images.  The goal is to be able to calculate the pH of each lysosome in the image, for which the ability to resolve their locations is an important step.  - In collaboration with NIA, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on large biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. Omnimorph, a graphic data analysis tool, is being developed for multidimensional data visualization. In this collaboration, we are also developing a model to predict the progression of Alzheimer's disease using plasma proteomic biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).  - Machine-learning methods have been devised and implemented to identify and refine transcription start sites in the fruit fly genome found using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE).  This effort is in collaboration with Brian Oliver of NIDDK.  - HPCIO has developed a standardized installation of various distributions of Linux, with customized configurations, that complies with many of the NIH computer configuration policies. This ""Lab Linux"" configuration leverages the existing IT infrastructure at NIH to comply with the user account life-cycle policy, user account password policy, and Incident Response Team (IRT) scanning policy, thereby making it easy for laboratory staff to use and maintain the system. We are currently seeking partners in the Institutes to test this deployment.  - In collaboration with CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process.   The effort so far has concentrated on exploratory analysis against the NIH portfolio to evaluate clustering methods and assess intrinsic measures of cluster quality.  - HPCIO has been collaborating with the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP), part of the NIH Common Fund, to develop the Common Assay Reporting System (CARS). CARS is an integrated system for managing bioassay information and facilitating communication between all the high-throughput screening centers within the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN). Goals for this collaboration include: 1) Track project status and related issues at each of the screening centers within the MLPCN, and provide the means for information collection, sharing and retrieval among the centers and the program office at NIH. 2) Establish a standardized protocol to describe raw data from the experiments and report screening data to the scientific community.  - The human salivary protein catalog has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - We are working with the Office of Extramural Research (OER) on applying machine-learning methods to identify important terms that peer reviewers use to describe innovative applications.  The goal of the effort is to develop a lexicon of terms that can help estimate the innovation level of a grant application based on peer review critiques from the applications NIH Summary Statement.  - Although the scientific impact of NCI consortia on the advancement of cancer epidemiology research is understood to be significant, accurate quantitative metrics of this impact are needed by program leadership. We are developing methods to track citations to clinical guidelines in the context of evidence-based medicine that could provide funding agencies and program directors insight into individual consortia's contributions in advancing medical knowledge. This work is being conducted in collaboration with Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP), NCI.  - HPCIO is working with NINDS and the Office of Extramural Research (OER) to determine peer-review sentiment of grant applications based on the NIH Summary Statement.  The sentiment analysis results can provide decision support information to NIH program directors considering applications for selective pay.  - Based on its experience in building novel models for classifying research grants and projects, HPCIO is collaborating with DPCPSI/OD and NCI to develop a comprehensive classification workflow system that will allow users to select from multiple classification algorithms, feature spaces, and training regimes, to build and run their own classifiers.  A particular prototype of this system is being tailored to assist NCI Intramural investigators in reporting their research to the Annual Report system.  - The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) is conducting a pilot investigation in collaboration with HPCIO to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning models for the classification of five BSSR-relevant research categories.   - In response to input from various collaborative groups, HPCIO is developing a portfolio visualization resource, known as PViz, that integrates visualization of categorical data with results of clustering algorithms, to allow analysts to gain new insight into their data.  Users may either construct a portfolio from IMPAC II data or import their own custom portfolio of categorical data.    - In collaboration with various groups including the Division of Planning, Coordination, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI/OD), HPCIO has been developing an augmented support vector machine (SVM) that augments a training set by sampling  from a corpus of unknowns and runs a large ensemble on various samples of this augmented space. The results obtained from this classifier suggest that, when coupled with an effective annotation strategy, such a classifier can be quite effective at categorizing a research portfolio. n/a","Text Analytics, Machine Learning & High Performance Computing",8746900,ZIHCT000200,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Annual Reports', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Critiques', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease Association', 'Drosophila genome', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant Review Process', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immunoglobulin Genes', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Linguistics', 'Linux', 'Location', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melissa', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Mouth Diseases', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Salivary Proteins', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cluster computing', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'peer', 'programs', 'prototype', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'social science research', 'text searching', 'tool']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2013,2419860,0.02775128141746655
"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates. Rigorous efficacy testing is needed to confirm that HIPS surrogates effectively reduce risk of exposing patient privacy by concealing the small amount of residual PHI all known de-identification leave behind.",Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools,8532984,R01LM011366,"['Address', 'Age', 'Applied Research', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Disclosure', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Simulate', 'Son', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'efficacy testing', 'male', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'prevent', 'programs', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NLM,KAISER FOUNDATION HEALTH PLAN OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,247288,0.014132128590704505
"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature 1) Electronic Textbook and PubMed Central Indexing Current processing of the electronic textbook material involves a number of steps designed to produce the most meaningful phrases in the text to be used as reference points. The first task is to identify grammatically reasonable phrases. We use a version of the Brill transformation based tagger, rewritten in C++, for part-of- speech tagging. This forms the basis for determining grammatically reasonable phrases. There is a significant post processing step that removes phrases that involve inappropriate references to context (e.g., different cells, final mutation). After finding grammatically reasonable phrases we attempt to eliminate those that are too common or generic to be useful (e.g., significant result, short time).  The next step is to compare a phrase with previously rated phrases that have been collected over the life of the project. The final stage is to estimate the importance of a phrase in the passage where it is found in a textbook. Such an estimate is based on the frequency of the phrase and the size of the passage compared with the frequency of the phrase throughout the book and the overall size of the book. In order to improve such an estimate we attempt to take account of the phrase or any phrase that represents the same concept. For this purpose we use the UMLS Metathesaurus and also stemming and combine these two approaches into a consistent picture of the concept as it occurs in the text.  The result of this processing is a scored list of phrase-book section pairs for each textbook. These are used to guide the response of general searching in the books. When a user types in a phrase that is on our curated list the first results given are the highly rated book sections for that phrase. We are now applying a similar indexing scheme to the text of articles in PMCentral. This allows us to give a list of highly rated phrases for each article as an enhanced reference point for searchers.    2) A significant fraction of queries in PubMed are multiterm queries and PubMed generally handles them as a Boolean conjunction of the terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simply collections of terms. We have examined whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that classes of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differ from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. The important insight here for indexing is that in some cases where the words of a phrase occur in text, but not as the phrase, the phrase may still be an appropriate concept to use in indexing the text.   3) Currently we are studying how good phrases can be recognized by their characteristics, such as frequency, tendency to be repeated in documents where they occur, and other numerical properties. These features allow one to predict which phrases are of high quality. We have found such predictions to be useful in studying different kinds of terms that may appear in text and how an ontoloogy might be extracted from text. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,8746749,ZIALM091711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Records', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'phrases', 'response', 'stem']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2013,184917,0.03725663547438291

"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our own research in the past has mostly focused on identifying genes and species in PubMed citations. In 2012-2013, we have continued our efforts in improving disease name detection in free text. Despite the central role of diseases in biomedical research, there have been much fewer attempts to automatically determine which diseases are mentioned in a text - the task of disease name normalization - compared with other normalization tasks (e.g. gene normalization) in biomedical text mining research. To this end, we developed the first machine-learning approach for disease name normalization (DNorm), based on our previously developed NCBI Disease corpus. Our technique is based on pairwise learning to rank, which has not previously been applied to the normalization task but has proven successful in very large optimization problems for information retrieval. When comparing our method to traditional approaches based on lexical normalization and matching, DNorm achieved 0.782 micro-averaged F-measure and 0.809 macro-averaged F-measure, an increase over the highest performing baseline method of 0.121 and 0.098, respectively. Our DNorm system was also applied to the 2013 ShARe/CLEF eHealth Shared Task, a worldwide challenge task of recognizing disease names in 4 different types of clinical notes (e.g. discharge summary). We achieved the highest performance in the disease normalization task among all 16 international participating teams.   Besides disease name recognition, we also improved the state of the art in finding mutations in free text. Text-mining mutation information from the literature becomes a critical part of the bioinformatics approach for the analysis and interpretation of sequence variations in complex diseases in the post-genomic era. It has also been used for assisting the creation of disease-related mutation databases. Most of existing approaches are rule-based and focus on limited types of sequence variations, such as protein point mutations. Thus, extending their extraction scope requires significant manual efforts in examining new instances and developing corresponding rules. As such, new automatic approaches are greatly needed for extracting different kinds of mutations with high accuracy. Hence, we developed tmVar, a text-mining approach based on conditional random field (CRF) for extracting a wide range of sequence variants described at protein, DNA and RNA levels according to a standard nomenclature developed by the Human Genome Variation Society. By doing so, we cover several important types of mutations that were not considered in traditional methods. Using a novel CRF label model and feature set, tmVar achieves higher performance than a state-of-the-art method on both our corpus (91.4 versus 78.1% in F-measure) and their own gold standard (93.9 versus 89.4% in F-measure).   As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we developed PubTator and assessed its use in assisting manual biocuration through participation in BioCreative 2012, an international workshop that brings together the text mining and biology communities to drive the development of text mining systems that can be integrated into the biocuration workflow and the knowledge discovery process.   Our PubTator system is a Web-based tool for assisting manual literature curation: a highly expensive endeavor of extracting knowledge from biomedical literature into structured databases. Our PubTator system is different from the few existing tools by featuring a PubMed-like interface, which many biocurators find familiar, and being equipped with multiple challenge-winning text mining algorithms to ensure the quality of its automatically computed results. Through a formal evaluation with two external user groups, PubTator was shown to be capable of improving both the efficiency and accuracy of manual curation. PubTator is currently being used in assisting real-life database curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8746751,ZIALM091813,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human Genome', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nomenclature', 'Online Systems', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Role', 'Societies', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'database structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'lexical', 'novel', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2013,821852,0.06965261208267609
"NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they usually also contain personal identifiers that are considered PHI, which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all of the identifiers in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents that can be used in research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques to recognize patient-related individually identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and redacts them. In this way, patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application that is capable of de-identifying many kinds of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design uses a number of deterministic and probabilistic pattern recognition algorithms and various computational linguistic methods as well as large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the reports are formatted as HL7 message, the application leverages the labeled patient-related information embedded in various HL7 segments to find such information in the free text narrative. The application software includes an editor for visualization and markup called the Visual Tagging Tool (VTT) that we use to produce gold standards against which to test the tool. Although designed specifically for tagging identifiers that contain personally identifiable, protected health information, VTT has been made publicly available to the greater NLP community for expanded lexical tagging and text annotation.  We are now studying the performance of our approach on a large corpus of tagged clinical documents. The preliminary results of this study suggest that computational de-identification methods may attain an accuracy at or better than the level of 99.9% sensitivity and 99% specificity across a large spectrum of identifiers containing personally identifiable information. n/a",NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,8746743,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Dictionary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Visual', 'design', 'lexical', 'patient privacy', 'tool', 'visual information']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2013,379288,0.014256976741457856
"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8535824,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,291730,0.06019871567871804

"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The construction of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process  natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities  of biomedical investigators to work building large ontologies.  We developed and evaluated the Collaborative Prot¿g¿ system in the first phase of our research project. This software system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an international community of scientists who develop ontologies in a cooperative, distributed manner. In this competing renewal proposal, we describe novel data-driven methods and tools that promise to make collaborative ontology design both more streamlined and more principled. Our goal is to create a more empirical basis for ontology engineering, and to develop methods whereby the ontology-engineering enterprise both can profit from data regarding the underlying processes and those processes in turn can generate increasing amounts of data to inform future ontology-engineering activities.  Our research plan entails three specific aims. First, we will enable ontology developers to apply ontology-design patterns (ODPs) to their ontologies, and we will measure the way in which these patterns alter the ontology-engineering process. Second, we will analyze the vast amounts of log data that we collect from users of Collaborative Prot¿g¿ to understand the patterns of ontology development. We will use these patterns to recommend to developers areas of ontologies that may need their attention, facilitating the process of reaching consensus and making collaborative ontology engineering more efficient. Finally, we will use the extensive data collected by our group and others to understand how scientists reuse terms from various ontologies and we will use these emerging patterns to facilitate term reuse. Each of these analyses not only will increase our understanding of collaboration in scientific modeling, but also will lead to new technology within our Collaborative Prot¿g¿ suite that will improve the ontology-development process and make collaboration among biomedical scientists more efficient.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Collaborative Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to cooperate in developing ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Collaborative Prot�g� supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics to build ontologies to solve problems in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision support. The proposed research will develop data-driven methods to identify patterns in design, development, and use of ontologies, and will apply these methods to help us to build new technology that both facilitates the ontology-development process and makes ontology design more principled.            ",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8504843,R01GM086587,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'International', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Parasites', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Software Engineering', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Thesauri', 'Time', 'Traditional Medicine', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical resource', 'biomedical scientist', 'craniofacial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'malformation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,527736,0.04939897857262152
"Protege: An Ontology-Development Platform for Biomedical Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in  biomedicine.  Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data.  The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Prot¿g¿ system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous internationa community of scientists-supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Prot¿g¿ users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 195,000 users as of this writing. To date, however, the use of ontologies in biomedicine has been limited by the complexity of the ontology-development tools, which often make ontologies inaccessible to many biomedical scientists.  In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly lower the barrier of entry for ontology development, expanding Prot¿g¿ to provide intuitive and user-friendly ontology-acquisition methods throughout the ontology lifecycle.  Our plan entails five specific aims.  First, we will develop methods that enable initial specification of ontology terms in an informal manner, using lists and diagrams.  Scientists will be able to start modeling their domain without having to think in terms of formal ontological distinctions. Second, we will provide intuitive, easy-to-use tools for ontology specification that will aid developers as they start to formalize their models.  Third, we will track the requirements that an ontology must address and develop novel  methods  for  evaluating  ontology  coverage  based  on  these  requirements.  Fourth, for ontologies that inherently have complex internal structure that cannot be represented fully using only simple ontology constructs, we will develop methods that will create templates covering regular structures in the ontology. Scientists will then be able to fill out forms based o these templates, with Prot¿g¿ generating the corresponding logical structure in the background.  Fifth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Prot¿g¿ user community, as it expands to include the biomedical scientists who will now be able to build the ontologies to support their data-driven research and discoveries.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prot�g� is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence  Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.  Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8471822,R00LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,224100,0.025115528173234317

"Scalable and Robust Clinical Text De-Identification Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploiting the full potential of information rich and rapidly growing repositories of patient clinical text is hampered by the absence of scalable and robust de-identification tools. Clinical text contains protected health information (PHI), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) restricts research use of patient information containing PHI to specific, limited, IRB-approved projects. As a result, vast repositories of clinical text remain under-used by internal researchers, and are even less available for external transmission to outside collaborators or for centralized processing by state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) technologies. De-identification, which is the removal of PHI from clinical text, is challenging. Despite their availability for over a decade, commercially available automated systems are expensive, require local tailoring, and have not gained widespread market penetration. Manual methods are costly and do not scale, yet continue to be used despite the small amount of residual PHI they leave behind. Open source de-identification tools based on state-of-the-art machine learning technologies can perform at or above the level of manual approaches but also suffer from the residual PHI problem. Current de-identification approaches, then, also severely limit the use and mobility of clinical text while exposing patients to privacy risks. These approaches redact PHI, blacking it out or replacing it with symbols (e.g., ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. **PT_NAME<AA>, a **AGE<60s> yo male with his son Doug ...""). Traditional approaches leave residual PHI (""Doug"" in this example) to be easily noticed by readers of the text, as it remains plainly visible among the prominent redactions. We developed and pilot tested an alternative approach we believe addresses the residual PHI problem. Our approach uses the strategy of concealing, rather than trying to eliminate, residual PHI. We call it the ""Hiding In Plain Sight"" (HIPS) approach. HIPS replaces all known PHI with ""surrogate"" PHI- fictional names, ages, etc.-that look real but do not refer to any actual patient. A HIPS version of the above text is: ""Here for cardiac eval is Mr. Jones, a 64 yo male with his son Doug ..."" where the name ""Jones"" and age ""64"" are fictional surrogates, but the name ""Doug"" is residual PHI. To a reader, the surrogates and the residual PHI are indistinguishable. This prevents the reader from detecting the latter, avoiding disclosure. Our preliminary studies suggest that HIPS can reduce the risk of disclosure of residual PHI by a factor of 10. This yields overall performance that far surpasses the performance attainable by manual methods, and is unlikely to be matched, we believe, by additional incremental improvements in PHI tagging models (i.e., efforts to reduce residual PHI). Our pilot studies indicate IRBs would welcome the HIPS approach if it were shown to be effective through rigorous evaluation. To expand usage of clinical text and enhance patient privacy, we propose to formalize rules of effective surrogate generation (Aim 1), extend related de-identification confidence scoring methods (Aim 2), and conduct rigorous efficacy testing of HIPS in diverse institutional settings (Aim 3).                  All known automated de-identification methods leave behind a small amount of residual protected health information (PHI), which presents a risk of disclosing patient privacy and creates barriers to more widespread internal use and external sharing of information-rich clinical text for broad research purpose. This project advances and evaluates the efficacy of a novel method, called the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) approach, which conceals residual PHI by replacing all other instance of PHI found in a document with realistic appearing but fictitious surrogates.

The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, genomics, proteomics, systems biology, ""big data"" analysis, and portfolio analysis.  In 2012, collaborative efforts in support of these goals included the following.  - The human salivary protein catalog has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - In collaboration with NCI, HPCIO is investigating document classifiers trained using machine-learning methods.  One aspect of this collaboration involves the development of a system to match ClinicalTrials.gov protocols with their funding source in IMPAC II.  The need for such a system is motivated by the fact that the NIH project number is specified in only 20% to 25% of all NIH-sponsored protocols.   An intended outcome of this matching system is improved classifier performance by augmenting grant document text with matching protocol text.    - In response to input from various collaborative groups, HPCIO is developing a portfolio visualization resource, dubbed PViz, that integrates visualization of categorical data with results of clustering algorithms, to allow analysts to gain new insight into their data.  Users may either construct a portfolio from IMPAC II data or import their own custom portfolio of categorical data.    - In collaboration with the Division of Planning, Coordination, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI/OD), we have trained a ""one-sided"" classifier on a set of Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) exemplars.  The results of this investigation suggest that, when coupled with an effective annotation strategy, such a classifier can be quite effective at retrospectively identifying CER grants.  - HPCIO has demonstrated the utility of its integrated portfolio clustering and visualization resource on NIAID's Anti-Microbial Resistance portfolio.  The current focus of the collaboration with NIAID is to investigate various machine-learning methods (including unsupervised, semi-supervised, and fully supervised algorithms) to map projects to NIAID HIV/AIDS priorities, objectives, and initiatives.  - HPCIO has been collaborating with the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP), part of the NIH Common Fund, to develop the Common Assay Reporting System (CARS). CARS is an integrated system for managing bioassay information and facilitating communication bettween all the high-throughput screening centers within the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN). Goals for this collaboration include: 1) Track project status and related issues at eaach of the screening centers within the MLPCN, and provide the means for information collection, sharing and retrieval among the centers and the program office at NIH. 2) Establish a standardized protocol to describe raw data from the experiments and report screening data to the scientific community.  - A novel statistical test has been developed to identify differential expressed RNA from RNAseq count data.  This work will provide a better idea of the biological differences between cell types.  - HPCIO is working with Melissa Friesen of NCI to develop methodologies to improve exposure classification in occupational epidemiologic studies. Initial effort of this collaboration involves a tool that helps experts to classify free-text job descriptions into standard occupational codes. Machine-learning based classification methods will also be utilized to help with evaluating exposure-disease associations.   - In collaboration with NINDS, HPCIO has implemented and compared several methods to locate and characterize lysosomes in 3-D fluorescence images.  The goal is to be able to calculate the pH of each lysosome in the image, for which the ability to resolve their locations is an important step.  - Machine-learning methods have been devised and implemented to identify and refine transcription start sites in the fruit fly genome found using cap analysis gene expression (CAGE).  This effort is in collaboration with Brian Oliver of NIDDK.  - We are applying machine-learning methods to identify important terms that peer reviewers use to describe innovative applications.  The goal of the effort is to develop a lexicon of terms that can help estimate the innovation level of a grant application based on peer review critiques from the applications NIH Summary Statement.  - HPCIO is working with NINDS and the Office of Extramural Research (OER) to determine peer-review sentiment of grant applications based on the NIH Summary Statement.  The sentiment analysis results can provide decision support information to NIH program directors considering applications for selective pay.  - In collaboration with NIA, we are applying machine learning and visualization techniques on mass biological datasets to discover novel patterns of functional gene or protein interactions as related to aging. Omnimorph, a graphic data analysis tool, is being developed for multidimensional data visualization.   - Although the scientific impact of NCI consortia on the advancement of cancer epidemiology research is understood to be significant, accurate quantitative metrics of this impact are needed by program leadership. We are developing methods to track citations to clinical guidelines in the context of evidence-based medicine that could provide funding agencies and program directors insight into individual consortias contributions in advancing medical knowledge. This work is being conducted in collaboration with Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program (EGRP), NCI.  - In collaboration with George Chacko of CSR, HPCIO is applying text analytics to provide CSR leadership with evidence-based decision support in evaluation of the grant review process.   The effort so far has concentrated on exploratory analysis against the NIH portfolio to evaluate clustering methods and assess intrinsic measures of cluster quality.  - Based on its experience in building novel models for classifying research grants and projects, HPCIO is collaborating with DPCPSI/OD and NCI to develop a comprehensive classification workflow system that will allow users to select from multiple classification algorithms, feature spaces, and training regimes, to build and run their own classifiers.  - The Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) is conducting a pilot investigation in collaboration with HPCIO to evaluate the efficacy of machine learning models for the classification of five BSSR-relevant research categories.    - NIA and the Alzheimer's Association have developed a Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to categorize Alaheimer's Disease Research.  HPCIO is in collaboration with NIA to develop classifiers for the six categories, 45 topics, and 145 themes. n/a","Text Analytics, Knowledge Engineering, & High Performance Computing",8565613,ZIHCT000200,"['3-Dimensional', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Applications Grants', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Critiques', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Association', 'Drosophila genome', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Investigation', 'Job Description', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Melissa', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Mouth Diseases', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Saliva', 'Salivary Proteins', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Side', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'peer', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'social science research', 'text searching', 'tool']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIH,2012,2726852,0.03335428625938972
"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature 1) Electronic Textbook and PubMed Central Indexing Current processing of the electronic textbook material involves a number of steps designed to produce the most meaningful phrases in the text to be used as reference points. The first task is to identify grammatically reasonable phrases. We use a version of the Brill transformation based tagger, rewritten in C++, for part-of- speech tagging. This forms the basis for determining grammatically reasonable phrases. There is a significant post processing step that removes phrases that involve inappropriate references to context (e.g., different cells, final mutation). After finding grammatically reasonable phrases we attempt to eliminate those that are too common or generic to be useful (e.g., significant result, short time).  The next step is to compare a phrase with previously rated phrases that have been collected over the life of the project. The final stage is to estimate the importance of a phrase in the passage where it is found in a textbook. Such an estimate is based on the frequency of the phrase and the size of the passage compared with the frequency of the phrase throughout the book and the overall size of the book. In order to improve such an estimate we attempt to take account of the phrase or any phrase that represents the same concept. For this purpose we use the UMLS Metathesaurus and also stemming and combine these two approaches into a consistent picture of the concept as it occurs in the text.  The result of this processing is a scored list of phrase-book section pairs for each textbook. These are used to guide the response of general searching in the books. When a user types in a phrase that is on our curated list the first results given are the highly rated book sections for that phrase. We are now applying a similar indexing scheme to the text of articles in PMCentral. This allows us to give a list of highly rated phrases for each article as an enhanced reference point for searchers.    2) A significant fraction of queries in PubMed are multiterm queries and PubMed generally handles them as a Boolean conjunction of the terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simply collections of terms. We have examined whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that classes of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differ from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. The important insight here for indexing is that in some cases where the words of a phrase occur in text, but not as the phrase, the phrase may still be an appropriate concept to use in indexing the text.   3) Currently we are studying how good phrases can be recognized by their characteristics, such as frequency, tendency to be repeated in documents where they occur, and other numerical properties. These features allow one to predict which phrases are of high quality. We have found such predictions to be useful in studying different kinds of terms that may appear in text and how an ontoloogy might be extracted from text. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,8558117,ZIALM091711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Records', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'phrases', 'response', 'stem']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2012,260305,0.03725663547438291
"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible. This project will extend and improve an automatic system, Textpresso, that finds relevant sentences within millions of sentences that likely contain crucial information. Textpresso also extracts some types of information automatically, making it possible to have organized databases of important information.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies. An innovative aspect of this proposal is the creation and application of novel, insight-based extrinsic evaluation techniques for such systems.          n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base,8309419,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Budgets', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Linguistics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Phenotype', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2012,596909,0.036855316932187736
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. Hence, it is important to be able to recognize various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc. Indeed, our previous PubMed log analysis revealed that people search certain biomedical concepts more often than others and that there exist strong associations between different concepts. For example, a disease name often co-occurs with gene/proteins and drug names. Our own research in the past has mostly focused on identifying genes and species in PubMed citations. In 2011-2012, while continuing our efforts in improving gene name recognition, we also turned our attention to disease name detection. Like genes, disease names are also irregular and ambiguous, making them difficult to be identified through simple dictionary look-up methods and an interesting task for the text-mining community. However, due to the lack of adequate training data, there has not been much work focused on disease name identification. To this end, we created a large-scale disease corpus consisting of 6,900 disease names in 793 PubMed abstracts. Developed by a team of 12 annotators (two people per annotation), our data corpus contains rich annotations for every disease occurrence in PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, disease names are categorized into four distinct groups: Specific Disease, Disease Class, Composite Mention and Disease Modifier. When used as the gold standard data for training state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms, significantly higher performance was found on our data than an existing one with limited annotations. Such characteristics make our disease name corpus a valuable resource for mining disease-related information from biomedical text.  Following named entity recognition, we also continued our research from previous years for automatically identifying relationships between various biological entities as an effort to build an end-to-end system that includes both entity recognition and relationship extraction. This year, our research emphasized on extracting pharmacogenomics (PGx) information from free text. Specifically, we developed a systematic approach to automatically identify PGx relationships between genes, drugs and diseases from trial records in ClinicalTrials.gov. In our evaluation, we found that our extracted relationships overlap significantly with the curated factual knowledge through the literature in a PGx database and that most relationships appear on average 5 years earlier in clinical trials than in their corresponding publications, suggesting that clinical trials may be valuable for both validating known and capturing new PGx related information in a more timely manner. Furthermore, two human reviewers judged a portion of computer-generated relationships and found an overall accuracy of 74% for our text-mining approach. This work has practical implications in enriching our existing knowledge on PGx gene-drug-disease relationships as well as suggesting crosslinks between ClinicalTrials.gov and other PGx knowledge bases.  As mentioned earlier, one promising application area for text mining research is to assist manual literature curation, a highly time-consuming and labor-intensive process. In this regard, we conducted two separate investigations, one aiming to understand the needs of the curation community and the other directly improve links between literature and biological data.   Together with colleagues outside of the NIH, we organized the BioCreative 2012 workshop on Interactive Text Mining in the Biocuration Workflow, an international event for bringing together the biocuration and text mining communities towards the development and evaluation of interactive text mining tools and systems to improve utility and usability in the biocuration workflow. Specifically, we chaired the Workshop Track II entitled Biocuration Workflows and Text Mining where we invited submissions of written descriptions of curation workflows from expert curated databases. We received seven qualified contributions, primarily from model organism databases such as FlyBase. Based on these descriptions, we identified commonalities and differences across the workflows, the common ontologies and controlled vocabularies used and the current and desired uses of text mining for biocuration. Compared to a similar study in 2009, our 2012 results show that many more databases are now using text mining in parts of their curation workflows. In addition, the Track II participants identified text-mining aids for finding gene names and symbols (gene indexing), prioritization of documents for curation (document triage), and ontology concept assignment as those most desired by the biocurators.  Our second curation-oriented text mining research focused on directly improving links between literature and biological data. As we all know that in todays biomedical search, high-throughput experiments and bioinformatics techniques are creating an exploding volume of data that are becoming overwhelming to keep track of for biologists and researchers who need to access, analyze and process existing data. Much of the available data are being deposited in specialized databases, such as the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for microarrays or the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for protein structures and coordinates. Data sets are also being described by their authors in publications archived in literature databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed Central. Currently, the curation of links between biological databases and the literature mainly relies on manual labor, which makes it a time-consuming and daunting task. Herein, we analyzed the current state of link curation between GEO, PDB and MEDLINE. We found that the link curation is heterogeneous depending on the sources and databases involved, and that overlap between sources is low, less than 50% for PDB and GEO. Furthermore, we showed that text-mining tools can automatically provide valuable evidence to help curators broaden the scope of articles and database entries that they review. As a result, we made recommendations to improve the coverage of curated links, as well as the consistency of information available from different databases while maintaining high-quality curation. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,8558092,ZIALM000002,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological databases', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Names', 'Ontology', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer generated', 'crosslink', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model organisms databases', 'protein structure', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2012,976145,0.06194478908239694
"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume. The goal of this project is to harvest large amounts of that information automatically, making it available to humans in summarized form and to computers in computer-readable form.",Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral,8318224,R01LM009254,"['Biological', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Research', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Work', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'information organization', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'scale up', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2012,572436,0.08089098746539564
"NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they usually also contain personal identifiers that are considered protected health information (PHI), which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all of the identifiers in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents that can be used in research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques to recognize patient-related individually identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and redacts them. In this way, patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application that is capable of de-identifying many kinds of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design uses a number of deterministic and probabilistic pattern recognition algorithms and various computational linguistic methods as well as large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the reports are formatted as HL7 message, the application leverages the labeled patient-related information embedded in various HL7 segments to find such information in the free text narrative. The application software includes an editor for visualization and markup called the Visual Tagging Tool (VTT) that we use to produce gold standards against which to test the tool. Although designed specifically for tagging identifiers that contain personally identifiable, protected health information, VTT has been made publicly available to the greater NLP community for expanded lexical tagging and text annotation.  We are now studying the performance of our approach on a large corpus of tagged clinical documents. The preliminary results of this study suggest that computational de-identification methods may attain an accuracy at or better than the level of 99.9% sensitivity and 99% specificity across a large spectrum of identifiers containing personally identifiable information. n/a",NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,8558114,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Dictionary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Visual', 'design', 'lexical', 'patient privacy', 'tool', 'visual information']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2012,349273,0.015108022532186512
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research  Project Summary (Abstract):  Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.  Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning. The goal of this project is to develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology and apply it to vaccine literature mining and analysis of vaccine-induced immune mechanisms.",Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research,8311060,R01AI081062,"['Algorithms', 'Attenuated Live Virus Vaccine', 'Automated Annotation', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Brucella', 'Brucella Vaccine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Ensure', 'Escherichia coli', 'Escherichia coli Vaccines', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Informatics', 'Information Networks', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Smallpox Vaccine', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Subunit Vaccines', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'abstracting', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'data integration', 'editorial', 'gene function', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'microorganism', 'novel', 'novel vaccines', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation', 'web interface']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,264994,0.03152998004209019
"Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research plan: The use of clinical knowledge systems such as UpToDate that provide reliable information at the point of care has been shown to improve patient safety and decision-making. With similar content to UpToDate, Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert (AME) is an online knowledge system that primarily contains over 5000 (and increasing) specialist-vetted answers to FAQs for point of care use. However, because of the overabundance of clinical resources and guidelines, adding new answers manually to AME and ensuring that it is consistent with evidence is time consuming. This problem is also faced with other systems such as UpToDate. This career grant proposes to investigate the feasibility of using a novel text mining based informatics approach to semi-automate the management of a clinical knowledge system, using AME as the test bed. Although the methods will be applicable to any clinical knowledge system and any topic, they will be evaluated using two important test topics from cardiology (which has the biggest focus in AME) - atrial fibrillation (a topic exhaustively covered in AME) and congestive heart failure (a topic less covered, but is an increasingly complex vast field with knowledge from huge literature). While the existing content of AME is private, the methods and the code we develop to assist in generating the content will be released open-source as part of the Open Health Natural Language Processing (OHNLP) consortium in UIMA framework. Career plan: As most communication of information in clinical practice and biomedical research occurs through the medium of text, the development of methods to render this text computer-interpretable is a prerequisite to the use of this information to improve quality of care and support scientific discovery. The PI's long-term career goal is to become a leader in biomedical informatics (informatics applied to biomedical data), with focus on textual data such as scientific papers and clinical notes. He has BS in Computer Science, PhD in Biomedical Informatics and over a dozen of peer-reviewed publications in biomedical text mining. His career goal is to advance diverse methods and applications of text mining across biomedical informatics (BMI). He will focus on: a) discovering information needs and gaps that can be filled, b) adapting and extending existing text mining algorithms, and c) validating the utility of the applications in the biomedical environment. Rationale: Making the transition from a mentored researcher to an independent researcher requires three main facets of career growth: a) developing a working familiarity with clinical information systems and medical terminologies; b) understanding the information needs of clinicians; and c) training in clinical research. The proposal will translate the PI's knowledgeof the text mining methods to practical experience in an operation clinical environment. Courses listed in the ""Career Development/Training Activities"" will educate him more about the environment and train him on clinical research. He will continue sharpening his informatics expertise by attending scientific conferences.              Project Narrative Medical errors are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It has been observed that point of care access to relevant clinical knowledge support decision making and decreases medical errors, thereby improving patient safety and healthcare costs. The proposed research aims to empower physicians specialized in the area (specialists) in quickly gathering evidence from literature or finding citations supporting or qualifying their expert opinion. It will also generate the answers and suggest updates to the existing answers for their perusal.",Improving the Efficiency and Efficacy in Authoring Essential Clinical FAQs,8442618,K99LM011389,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Beds', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calculi', 'Cardiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Familiarity', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Paper', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'empowered', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'medical information system', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'patient safety', 'point of care', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'usability']",NLM,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2012,96552,0.07507399117176936
"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8326650,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2012,317212,0.06019871567871804

In FY12, NLM enhanced applications programming interfaces (APIs) to its UMLS and drug vocabulary resources, released new mappings from SNOMED CT to ICD-10-CM and from ICD-9-CM to SNOMED CT, and expanded documentation and training resources for EHR developers and users. n/a",National Biomedical Information Services,8558151,ZIHLM200888,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'African American', 'Amendment', 'American', 'American Indian and Alaska Native', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biotechnology', 'Books', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Health', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaiian population', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-10-CM', 'ICD-9-CM', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Information Centers', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Services', 'Information Specialists', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Journals', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'MEDLINE', 'Maps', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular Biology', 'Names', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Native Americans', 'Native-Born', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nomenclature', 'Package Insert', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personal Health Records', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Poison Control Centers', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Rural', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Summary Reports', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Terminology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Toxicology Data Network', 'Toxics Release Inventory', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical information system', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'dosage', 'drug market', 'drug standard', 'exhibitions', 'genome wide association study', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'health literacy', 'high school', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inner city', 'instrument', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'mammalian genome', 'metathesaurus', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'systems research', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIH,2012,2346125,0.04872727149013261
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,8242742,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Systems Development', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,392767,0.038688742968528485

"Exploring Natural Language Processing, Image Processing, Machine Learning, and Us    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most biomedical text mining systems target only text information and do not provide intelligent access to other important data such as Figures. More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biomedical articles nearly always incorporate images that are the crucial content of biomedical knowledge discovery. Biomedical scientists need to access images to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. Evaluation has shown that textual statements reported in the literature are frequently noisy (i.e., contain ""false facts""). Capturing images that are essentially experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit biomedical information systems, databases, and biomedical scientists. We are developing a biomedical literature figure search engine BioFigureSearch. We develop innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning and user interfacing. The deliverables will be novel biomedical natural language figure processing (bNLfP) algorithms and iBioFigureSearch allowing biomedical scientists to access figure data effectively, and open-source tools that will enhance biomedical information retrieval, summarization, and question answering. The bNLfP algorithms we will be developing can be applied or integrated into other biomedical text-mining systems.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries. It is anticipated that the algorithms, models, and tools developed will significantly enhance biomedical scientists' access to figures reported in literature, and thereby expedite biomedical knowledge discovery.          This project proposes innovative algorithms and models in natural language processing, image processing, machine learning, and user interfacing, to return figures in response to biomedical queries.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Translation of biomedical research into practice depends in part on the production of quality systematic reviews that synthesize available evidence. Unfortunately, about 20% of reviews are never completed. Of those that reach fruition, the average time to completion may be 2.4 years, with a reported maximum of 9 years. A major bottleneck occurs when teammates screen studies. In the first step, they independently identify provisionally eligible studies by reading the same set of perhaps thousands of titles and abstracts. To date, researchers have used supervised machine learning (ML) methods in an attempt to automate identification of eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, finding nonrandomized (NR) studies for inclusion in systematic reviews has yet to be addressed. This is an important problem because RCTs may be unlikely or even unethical for some research questions. Hypotheses. It is broadly hypothesized that (a) methods based on natural language processing and ML can be used to automatically identify topically relevant studies with a mix of NR designs eligible for inclusion in systematic reviews; and (b) machine performance can consistently reach current human standards with respect to identifying eligible studies. Aims. This research has three aims: (1) Compare the language that biomedical researchers use to describe their NR study designs with existing relevant vocabularies. Develop complementary terminologies for overlooked NR study designs to improve coverage of important vocabularies. Develop and validate a standalone terminology to support librarians who add free-text terms to expert searches. (2) Develop and compare procedures based on natural language processing and supervised ML methods to identify provisionally eligible NR studies that are topically relevant from a set of citations, including titles, abstracts, and metadata. Use terms for NR study designs to improve classification. (3) Generalize procedures developed under Aims 1 and 2 to select topically relevant studies with a mix of designs for provisional inclusion in several types of systematic reviews. Use contextual information in segments of full texts tagged for location to enrich feature vectors. Methods. Reference standards will be built from studies in published Cochrane reviews. Features will be extracted from citations and regions of full texts. Additionally, feature vectors will be enriched with terms for designs that researchers use in combination with terms extracted from major vocabularies. Model performance will be compared with respect to several measures, including mean recall and precision, for 10-fold cross-validations and validations on held-out test sets. Significance. The proposed research is significant because it will help support translation of biomedical research to improve human health. Moreover, developing procedures to identify NR studies is essential for the expeditious translation of a very large body of research.           Translation of biomedical research helps to improve public health by delivering the best available evidence to clinicians. This process depends in part on the production of systematic reviews of research. Computerized procedures will be developed to reduce the labor associated with screening nonrandomized studies for inclusion in reviews.",Screening Nonrandomized Studies for Inclusion in Systematic Reviews of Evidence,8190163,K99LM010943,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Health', 'Human', 'Language', 'Librarians', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'improved', 'research to practice', 'systematic review', 'vector']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2011,89802,0.02525713962232972
"PubMed Query Log Analysis and Use in Access Enhancement 1) Biomedical literature search is the main entry point for an ever-increasing range of information. PubMed/MEDLINE is the most widely used service for this purpose. However, finding citations relevant to a users information need is not always easy in PubMed. Improving our understanding of the growing population of PubMed users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by PubMed. One resource for understanding and characterizing patrons of search engines is the transaction logs. Our previous investigation of user query logs has led us to develop and deploy a useful application in assisting user query formulation in PubMed, namely Related Queries (RQ). Inspired by its success, we have continued using log analysis to identify research problems which are closely related to PubMed operations.   2) Another application of query log analysis starts with a disease name or some other significant term and asks how often a document containing this term is clicked on in response to a query containing this term. This click through rate is used as a feature in machine learning to decide whether a document has the disease as a central focus. n/a",PubMed Query Log Analysis and Use in Access Enhancement,8344966,ZIALM200812,"['Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Goals', 'Information Services', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Names', 'Population', 'PubMed', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Services', 'improved', 'meetings', 'operation', 'response', 'success', 'text searching']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2011,59961,0.03586095702293715
"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,8075593,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,274386,0.03607545401106996
"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature 1) Electronic Textbook and PubMed Central Indexing Current processing of the electronic textbook material involves a number of steps designed to produce the most meaningful phrases in the text to be used as reference points. The first task is to identify grammatically reasonable phrases. We use a version of the Brill transformation based tagger, rewritten in C++, for part-of- speech tagging. This forms the basis for determining grammatically reasonable phrases. There is a significant post processing step that removes phrases that involve inappropriate references to context (e.g., different cells, final mutation). After finding grammatically reasonable phrases we attempt to eliminate those that are too common or generic to be useful (e.g., significant result, short time).  The next step is to compare a phrase with previously rated phrases that have been collected over the life of the project. The final stage is to estimate the importance of a phrase in the passage where it is found in a textbook. Such an estimate is based on the frequency of the phrase and the size of the passage compared with the frequency of the phrase throughout the book and the overall size of the book. In order to improve such an estimate we attempt to take account of the phrase or any phrase that represents the same concept. For this purpose we use the UMLS Metathesaurus and also stemming and combine these two approaches into a consistent picture of the concept as it occurs in the text.  The result of this processing is a scored list of phrase-book section pairs for each textbook. These are used to guide the response of general searching in the books. When a user types in a phrase that is on our curated list the first results given are the highly rated book sections for that phrase. We are now applying a similar indexing scheme to the text of articles in PMCentral. This allows us to give a list of highly rated phrases for each article as an enhanced reference point for searchers.    2) A significant fraction of queries in PubMed are multiterm queries and PubMed generally handles them as a Boolean conjunction of the terms. However, analysis of queries in PubMed indicates that many such queries are meaningful phrases, rather than simply collections of terms. We have examined whether or not it makes a difference, in terms of retrieval quality, if such queries are interpreted as a phrase or as a conjunction of query terms. And, if it does, what is the optimal way of searching with such queries. To address the question, we developed an automated retrieval evaluation method, based on machine learning techniques, that enables us to evaluate and compare various retrieval outcomes. We show that classes of records that contain all the search terms, but not the phrase, qualitatively differ from the class of records containing the phrase. We also show that the difference is systematic, depending on the proximity of query terms to each other within the record. Based on these results, one can establish the best retrieval order for the records. Our findings are consistent with studies in proximity searching. The important insight here for indexing is that in some cases where the words of a phrase occur in text, but not as the phrase, the phrase may still be an appropriate concept to use in indexing the text.   3) Currently we are studying how good phrases can be recognized by their characteristics, such as frequency, tendency to be repeated in documents where they occur, and other numerical properties. These features allow one to predict which phrases are of high quality. We have found such predictions to be useful in studying different kinds of terms that may appear in text and how an ontoloogy might be extracted from text. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,8344960,ZIALM091711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Books', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Electronics', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Property', 'PubMed', 'Records', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'UMLS Metathesaurus', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'phrases', 'response', 'stem']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2011,239845,0.03725663547438291
"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Biomedical researchers need to read or skim many thousands of scientific articles each year, more than is humanly possible.

"Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services Over the last decade, the online search for biological information has progressed rapidly and has become an integral part of any scientific discovery process. Today, it is virtually impossible to conduct R&D in biomedicine without relying on the kind of Web resources developed and maintained by the NCBI. Indeed, each day millions of users search for biological information via NCBIs online Entrez system. However, finding data relevant to a users information need is not always easy in Entrez. Improving our understanding of the growing population of Entrez users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by NCBI. One resource for understanding and characterizing patrons of search engines is the transaction logs. Our previous investigation of PubMed query logs has led us to develop and deploy several useful applications in assisting user searches and retrieval such as the query formulation in PubMed, namely Related Queries and Query Autocomplete. Inspired by its success, we have continued using log analysis to identify research problems which are closely related to NCBI operations.    Among all Entrez databases, PubMed is the most used one and often serves as an entry point for people to access related data in other Entrez databases.  In a recent survey, we compared and contrasted PubMed with other similar literature search tools developed by other researchers. Based on our investigation, we found that there are areas where PubMed may learn from others for self-improvement with respect to better retrieval and user search experience. For instance, several tools differ from PubMed in that they allow relevance search, an important feature that can be helpful for some PubMed searches. With respect to user interface, other tools have attempted to visualize search results using novel schemes such as clusters, word clouds or networks. Though these methods are not formally validated in large-scale user studies, the concept of better visualization of search results might still be useful for consideration towards improving PubMeds current list-based presentation.   In 2011, we have also studied query logs beyond PubMed. One specific project involves the analysis of user logs of NCBIs Global Search where user queries are searched against all Entrez databases and results are presented without indicating the relevancy of different databases to the user queries. Hence our task is to predict which Entrez database(s) is mostly likely to contain the relevant information to the users based on their input queries. In our current approach we first collect a data corpus from logs where each data point contains a user query followed by a user click to a specific database. Next, we apply machine-learning algorithms to learn the characteristics in user queries that distinguish users intention for seeking different biological data. Based on the learned features, we classify new input queries and direct users to results in relevant database(s) for their search needs.   Another use of query logs lies in our work for PubMed Health: a newly launched NCBI service offering up-to-date information on diseases, conditions, drugs, treatment options, and healthy living for both health consumers and healthcare professionals. Based on our log analysis of actual usage on disease and drug topics in PubMed Health, we discovered that approximately 80% of the usage falls on 20% of the database content. That is, the user access pattern satisfies the Pareto principle (aka the 80-20 rule), which can have many implications for further improving our Web service. For instance, the principle suggests that we prioritize our resources on those heavily accessed content. In addition, query logs were used when we deployed our research on building links for enriching user access between related drug and disease pages as portlets in PubMed Health. Specifically, we developed text-mining methods for automatically identifying drugs and its closely related diseases (e.g. Lipitor and heart disease). In particular, we took advantage of the co-occurrence information of drug and disease mentions in user queries to help determine their strength in relatedness and popularity in user needs. As a result, we computed several thousand pairs of drug and diseases that are not only closely related but also frequently requested by our users. n/a",Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services,8344934,ZIALM000001,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Heart Diseases', 'Imagery', 'Information Services', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Work', 'atorvastatin', 'base', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'meetings', 'novel', 'operation', 'research and development', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'web services']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2011,499678,0.012810747999878136
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research.  However, they usually also contain personal identifiers that are considered protected health information (PHI), which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all of the identifiers in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents that can be used in research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques to recognize patient-related individually identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and redacts them. In this way, patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application that is capable of de-identifying many kinds of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design uses a number of deterministic and probabilistic pattern recognition algorithms and various computational linguistic methods as well as large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the reports are formatted as HL7 message, the application leverages the labeled patient-related information embedded in various HL7 segments to find such information in the free text narrative. The application software includes an editor for visualization and markup called the Visual Tagging Tool (VTT) that we use to produce gold standards against which to test the tool. Although designed specifically for tagging identifiers that contain personally identifiable, protected health information, VTT has been made publicly available to the greater NLP community for expanded lexical tagging and text annotation.  We are now studying the performance of our approach on a large corpus of tagged clinical documents. The preliminary results of this study suggest that computational de-identification methods may attain an accuracy at or better than the level of 99.9% sensitivity and 99% specificity across a large spectrum of identifiers containing personally identifiable information. n/a",NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,8344957,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Dictionary', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Linguistics', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Visual', 'design', 'lexical', 'patient privacy', 'tool', 'visual information']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2011,333200,0.015108022532186512
"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress. Stress and anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 19.1 million people in the USA, costing $42 billion in health costs per year (source: Anxiety Disorders Association of America).          n/a",BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l,8055527,R01GM083871,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Digital Libraries', 'Discipline', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Maintenance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Ontology', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'PubMed', 'Published Comment', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'software development', 'statistics', 'text searching', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2011,248610,0.059594299370999845
"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,8138486,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,266112,0.02876750363302456

"Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       A great challenge in the biomedical informatics domain is to develop computational methods that combine existing knowledge and experimental data to derive new knowledge regarding biological systems and disease mechanisms. Most knowledge regarding genes and proteins in biomedical literature is stored in the form of free text that is not suitable for computation, and the manual processes of encoding this body of knowledge into computable form cannot keep up with the rate of knowledge accumulation. The main thrust of the proposed research is to design novel statistical text-mining algorithms to acquire and represent knowledge regarding genes and proteins from free-text literature, and further to combine this acquired knowledge with experimental data to derive new knowledge. We will organize the proposed research to the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Develop ontology-guided semantic modeling algorithms for extracting biological concepts from free text, in which we will design hierarchical probabilistic topic models that are capable of representing biological concepts as a hierarchy and develop novel learning algorithms to infer biological concepts from free-text documents. Specific Aim 2. Integrate semantic modeling with BioNLP to extract textual evidence supporting protein-function annotations. We will develop information extraction algorithms that will combine the results of hierarchical semantic analysis and BioNLP to identify the text regions that will most likely provide evidence regarding the function of genes/proteins and map the extracted information to a controlled vocabulary. Specific Aim 3. Develop a framework to unify the procedures of knowledge reasoning and data mining for knowledge discovery. In this aim, we will reason using existing knowledge (represented in the form of an ontology) to reveal functional modules among the genes from the experimental data. We will then further develop algorithms that will reveal relationships between these gene modules by mining system-scaled experimental data. The overall framework will integrate functional reasoning and data mining in an iterative manner to refine the knowledge progressively and to derive rules such as: when genes involved in biological process X are perturbed, genes involved in biological process Y will respond. We will test the framework on the data from yeast-system biology studies and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to gain insights into the cellular systems and disease mechanisms of cancer cells.           In recent decades, biomedical sciences have achieved significant advances; most of the knowledge resulting from research is stored in the form of biomedical literature in the form free-text. This project develop computational approaches to extract knowledge from biomedical literature, represent the knowledge in computable form, and combined the knowledge with experiment data to gain insights into biological systems and disease mechanisms",Ontology-Driven Methods for Knowledge Acquisition and Knowledge Discovery,8202896,R01LM011155,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Tweens', 'Yeasts', 'biological systems', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer cell', 'data mining', 'design', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'novel', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'text searching']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,312599,0.06019871567871804
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching long-term vision of our research is to create novel technologies for processing clinical free text. Such technologies will enable sophisticated and efficient indexing, retrieval and data mining over the ever increasing amounts of electronic clinical data. Processing free text poses a number of challenges to which the fields of Artificial intelligence, natural language processing and computer science in general have made advances. Methods for processing free text are informed by linguistic theory combined with the power of statistical inferencing. A key component to the next step, natural language understanding, is discovering events and their relations on a timeline. Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles.        The goal of our current proposal is to discover temporal relations from clinical free text through achieving four specific aims:        Specific Aim 1: Develop (1) a temporal relation annotation schema and guidelines for clinical free text based on TimeML, which will require extensions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet annotation guidelines to the clinical domain, (2) an annotated corpus following the temporal relations schema with additions to Treebank, PropBank and VerbNet, (3) a descriptive study comparing temporal relations in the clinical and general domains.        Specific Aim 2: Extend and evaluate existing methods and/or develop new algorithms for temporal relation discovery in the clinical domain. Component-level evaluation        Specific Aim 3: Integrate best method and/or a variety of methods for temporal relation discovery into the open source Mayo Clinic IE pipeline and release as open source annotators in the pipeline. Functional testing. Dissemination activities.        Specific Aim 4: System-level evaluation. Test the functionality of the enhanced Mayo Clinic IE pipeline on translational research use cases, e.g. the progression of colon cancer as documented in clinical notes and pathology reports, the progression of brain tumor as documented in radiology reports.        The methods we will use for the temporal relation discovery are based on machine learning, e.g., Support Vector Machine technology. Such methods require the annotation of a reference standard from which the computations are derived. The best methods will be released as part of the Mayo Clinic Information Extraction System for the larger community to use and contribute to. We will test the methods against biomedical queries.           Relevance (max 2-3 sentences) Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments.

"Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data This projects studies statistical learning machines as applied to biomedical and clinical prediction, probabilitiy assignment, regresssion, and ranking problems. The algorithms involved include Random Forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and variations of the boosting algorithm. These are all recently developed techniques orginally constructed by the machine learning community, and which are only now starting to see applications in biomedical problems. These methods were not designed through familiar parametric statistical reasoning, but using the more advanced methods of nonparametric density estimation, are known to be provably Bayes risk consistent. Hence, as the data set grows the methods do optimally classify cases and subjects, for example. As routinely applied to data collected by clinicians or biomedical researchers, these new techniques require modifications and enhancements appropriate to data collected from these alternate sources. In particular, we address the problem of (1) greatly unbalanced data sets, where the researcher typically has only a handful of positive cases and a great many negative cases, (2) the issue of accurate estimates of prediction error rates, where the researcher typically has a relatively small data set upon which to do both model fitting and testing, and (3) the interpretation of the means by which the prediction engine operates and the development of practical prognostic factors.      These three problems are essential questions facing the use of modern prediction engines, but have been only lightly studied by the machine learning community. On the other hand, the rigorous methods of the mathematical statistics community have demonstrated the unusual versatility and flexibility of these methods. We have applied these statistical learning machine schemes to a wide variety of biological datasets, such as a two million snp data sets on childhood-onset schizophrenia.      At the invitaion of Cambridge University Press we wrote a complete and detailed book on machine learning methods for the biomedical research community.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective. This will make biologists, clinicians and medical researchers better able to track advances in the biomedical literature that are relevant to their work.          n/a",ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS,7851323,R01GM081293,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biology', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Eukaryota', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Output', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'knowledge base', 'man', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,278345,0.03607545401106996
"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Textpresso information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Collective Intelligence, Knowledge Infrastructure, & High Performance Computing The Collective Intelligence, Knowledge Infrastructure, and High Performance Program, which  operates within the High Performance Computing and Informatics Office (HPCIO), Division of Computational Bioscience of CIT, is collaborating with NIH investigators to build a critical mass in collective intelligence that is envisioned to encompass a number of pertinent and related disciplines in biomedical research including semantic interoperability, knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, text and data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization.  The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, proteomics research, genomics, systems biology, and portfolio analysis.  In 2009, collaborations in support of these goals included the following.  - The human salivary protein catalog has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - HPCIO has developed context-sensitive text-mining methodology for identifying High-Risk, High-Reward (HRHR) research based from NIH Summary Statements.  The method, which uses natural language processing to parse text and classify documents, has been successful in retrospective analysis of the most recent five-years summaries.  This work is being conducted in collaboration with Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), NIH Office of the Director (OD).   - HPCIO is developing a corpus of annotated NIH medical records for use in developing methods of document de-identification.  The goal is to create a gold standard that de-identification algorithms for use at NIH can be measured against.  This work, in collaboration with the Clinical Center, will enhance the availability of medical records stored within the Biomedical Translational Research Information System.    - HPCIO is working with the caBIG Clinical Trial Management System Workspace (in collaboration with NCI) to develop a Protocol Lifecycle Tracking (PLT) tool.  By providing real-time protocol status information on all relevant trials to clinicians and researchers, bottlenecks and latencies in protocol management can be identified and corrected by those responsible for conduct of a trail and the overall success of a clinical trial program.   - As a component of the Molecular Libraries Roadmap imitative, the Common Assay Reporting System (CARS) allows investigators and program directors to track the status of assay projects related information at each screening center within the Molecular Libraries Program Center Network (MLPCN). The system also provides a means for collecting, sharing and retrieving of bioassay information among the centers and program office at NIH.    - HPCIO is collaborating with NCI to develop deep knowledge bases representing NCIs scientific portfolio.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7929664,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,277200,0.02876750363302456
"NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Clinical text documents contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that is invaluable for clinical research. Unfortunately, they remain a largely untapped resource since disseminating such data as-is would jeopardize the privacy of patients and reveal protected health information.  Computational de-identification is a means to overcome this problem. It involves processing clinical text documents using natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques, recognizing patient-related individually identifiable information (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and redacting only those identifiers. In this way, patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  Without computational tools, de-identification places a heavy burden on clinicians shoulders, but it is a necessary step for protecting patient privacy as mandated by both the Privacy Rule of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Privacy Act of 1974. After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) is developing new software that is capable of de-identifying many kinds of clinical text documents with high accuracy.  The software design uses a number of deterministic and probabilistic pattern recognition algorithms and various computational linguistic methods. We are using many large datasets for names, addresses, and organizations, all of which have the potential to identify patients, in order to find and remove such content from the text.  The application accepts text documents in plain text or in HL7 format. If documents are provided in an HL7 format, the application makes use of patient related information embedded in various HL7 segments and fields in order to find and remove that information, including typographical errors and misspellings, from the corpus of the text with high accuracy.  The application software includes an editor for visualization and markup called the Visual Tagging Tool (VTT). Although designed specifically for tagging identifiers that contain personally identifiable protected health information, VTT will be made publicly available to the greater NLP community for expanded lexical tagging and text annotation.  We are beginning a series of studies to assess the success of de-identifying on a large corpus of tagged clinical documents. The preliminary results of this study suggest that computational de-identification methods may attain an accuracy at or better than the level of 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity across a large spectrum of identifiers containing personally identifiable information. n/a",NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,8158053,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Process', 'Social Security Number', 'Text']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2010,317141,0.022119854345613317
"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts. The result of this work is Protege, a workbench that allows users to edit and apply controlled terminologies, ontologies, and knowledge bases to a wide range of information-management problems. To date, more than 50,000 people have registered as users of the system. Many diverse projects in biomedicine-supported by nearly every institute and center at NIH-have become critically dependent on this software and the knowledge-engineering principles that it supports. This P41 competing renewal application seeks to continue support for Protege, as a biomedical informatics resource that will benefit the system's entire user community.      We propose technology research and development to expand the capabilities of the Protege system to meet the current and anticipated needs of the user community. We will re-engineer Protege with a service-oriented architecture that can adapt to the requirements of new ontology languages, large ontology repositories, and cutting-edge ontology-management-services, such as reasoning, alignment, and evolution. We will create support for collaborative ontology development, in the context of both large, centralized projects and open, decentralized efforts. We also will develop advanced support for using ontologies in application software development and as integral parts of software systems.      As a biomedical informatics resource, we will expand our collaborative research projects with other Prot¿g¿ users. We will provide service to the Protege user community through enhanced technical support, user documentation, tutorials, and workshops.

"Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature As a document retrieval system, PubMed aims at providing efficient access to millions of scientific documents. For this purpose, it relies on matching keywords and semantic representations of PubMed documents to user queries. One type of semantic representation used in MEDLINE citations is known as Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) indexing terms, which are assigned by professional human indexers at the National Library of Medicine. Alternatively, author keywords, provided by authors when submitting an article, capture the essence of the topic of a document from the authors perspective. Last but not least, readers have their own opinions about what words are of importance to an article, which may or may not agree with either MeSH terms or author keywords of the same article.  PubMed relies on human indexers to assign the appropriate MeSH indexing terms to PubMed articles  a very time and labor-intensive process. As a result, these terms are not immediately available for new articles. In fact, our analysis shows that on average it takes over 90 days for a PubMed citation to be manually annotated with MeSH terms. In response, we have developed a machine learning algorithm for automatically predicting MeSH terms with a set of novel features. When compared to other state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved significantly better performance. We are currently exploring its potential for assisting the manual MeSH curation process in practice.   As MeSH terms require human curation, author keywords can be obtained freely from journal articles when they are available. We conducted a first study on author keywords in biomedical articles where we described the growth of author keywords in biomedical journal articles and presented a comparative study of author keywords and MeSH indexing terms. A similarity metric from our past study was used to automatically assess the relatedness between pairs of author keywords and MeSH indexing terms. Furthermore, a set of 300 pairs was manually reviewed to evaluate the metric and characterize the relationships between the term types. Results show that author keywords are increasingly available in biomedical articles and that over 60% of author keywords can be linked to a closely related indexing term. Results of this work have implications in both MEDLINE document indexing and MeSH terminology development.   Finally by comparison, we found neither MeSH terms nor author keywords overlap significantly with the important words from the users point of view, which motivated us to learn what characteristics make document words important from a collective user perspective. Specifically, we applied machine learning to identify document keywords which would likely be used frequently in user queries. Each word was represented by a set of features that included different types of information, such as semantic type, part of speech tag, TF-IDF weight and location in the abstract. We examined both traditional features such as TF-IDF, as well as novel ones such as named entity, which have not been explored before in this context. We identified the most important features and evaluated our model using months of real-world PubMed log data. Our results suggest that, in addition to carrying high TF-IDF weight, important words from the users perspective tend to be biomedical entities, to exist in article titles, and to occur repeatedly in article abstracts. This study enabled us to automatically predict words likely to appear in user queries that lead to document clicks. The relative importance of predicted words can also play a role in ranking documents by relevance. n/a",Automatic Analysis and Annotation of Document Keywords in Biomedical Literature,8149607,ZIALM091711,['Literature'],NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2010,391740,0.043835083960465024
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7774343,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'conflict resolution', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,525262,0.038688742968528485
"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7945368,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design', 'empowered', 'gene function', 'graphical user interface', 'information organization', 'instrument', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'sound', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,428079,0.050933060573656
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7928868,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2010,605009,0.06776773073088131

It was significantly expanded to respond to new clinical trial registration and results reporting requirements established by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (PL 110-85). In FY10, nearly 16,000 trials were registered. Since NLM implemented the results database required by law in September 2008, summary results of more than 3200 clinical trials have been added. Summaries of adverse events that occurred during the trial became mandatory in September 2009. Toxicology and Environmental Health:  Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) is a primary reference for toxicologists, poison control centers, public health administrators, physicians and other environmental health professionals, and includes databases such as TOXLINE, GENE-TOX, the Toxic Release Inventory, and the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB). In FY10, nanomaterials were added to HSDB. Drug Information Resources: NLMs drug information resources include DailyMed and Pillbox. DailyMed provides medication content and labeling information from medical package inserts for more than 10,000 marketed drugs. Pillbox enables rapid identification of unknown solid-dosage medications based on physical characteristics and high-resolution images. Both are linked to RxNorm standard drug names. Disaster Preparedness and Response:  NLMs Disaster Information Management Research Center facilitates access to disaster information, promotes effective use of libraries and disaster information specialists for disaster management, and supports initiatives to ensure uninterrupted access to critical health information resources when disasters occur. A collaboration with the Bethesda Hospital Emergency Preparedness Partnership provides backup communication systems and tools for patient tracking, information access, and responder training. In FY10, specialized resources for earthquakes and oil spills were developed, including the Haiti Earthquake People Locator, an interactive re-unification tool. Molecular Biology, Bioinformatics, and Human Genome Resources: NCBI information resources include more than 40 integrated molecular biology databases and bioinformatics software tools such as GenBank, Entrez, BLAST, RefSeq, UniGene, LocusLink, Genomes, and the NCBI software toolkit. NCBI also produces the retrieval systems for PubMed, PubMed Central, and the Books database. Continuing areas of emphasis in FY10 included addressing the impact of enormous quantities of data emanating from high throughput sequencing, microarray, and small molecule screening techniques; organizing data from large-scale clinical studies involving genotyping; and enhancing database interfaces to facilitate search and discovery across multiple resources.  Outreach: Promoting Public Awareness and Access  Consumer health websites and the NIH MedlinePlus Magazine, in English and Spanish, transmit the latest useful research findings in lay language. In FY10, distribution of the magazine increased to more than 600,000, with additional access via online versions. Special population websites address specific minority health concerns in various racial and ethnic groups. NLM  outreach programs enhance awareness of its information services, with emphasis on. underserved populations, including African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities, as well as health professionals serving minority populations and practicing in rural and inner city communities. In FY10, dozens of community-based projects were funded. Health Services Research  NICHSR promotes access to public health and health services research through such information systems as: HSRProj, a database of more than 8000 health services research projects from more than 110 funding organizations; HSRR, a  database of research datasets, instruments and software relevant to health services research; and HSTAT, a full-text database of high quality evidence reports, guidelines, technology assessments, consensus statements, and treatment protocols. Structured search queries are developed to aid in searching PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and HSRProj for information on health services research, comparative effectiveness, health disparities, and HealthyPeople 2010 objectives. Advanced Information Systems, Data Standards and Research Tools  In FY10, LHC and NCBI continued to conduct research in biomedical informatics and computational biology, tested the effectiveness of medical informatics interventions, and developed new scientific computing tools. To cite a few examples, intramural researchers developed tools that support standards-based personal health records; extended the use of digital pen technology for community-based research in Africa; applied natural language processing methods to extract information from biomedical literature; improved standardized reporting of genetic variations and clinical interpretation of genetic test results; and designed improved methods for integrated search and discovery across multiple databases.  Health Data Standards: As the central coordinating body for clinical terminology standards within DHHS, NLM supports nationwide implementation of an interoperable health information technology infrastructure. NLM develops or licenses key clinical terminologies and problem lists designated as standards for U.S. health information exchange. The Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, with more than 9.9 million concept names from more than 125 vocabularies, is a distribution mechanism for standard code sets and vocabularies used in health data systems. NLM also produces RxNorm, a standard clinical drug vocabulary; supports the LOINC nomenclature for laboratory tests and patient observations; and promotes international adoption of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology. In FY10, NLM produced a common lab test subset and added the VAs drug classes to RxNorm. n/a",National Biomedical Information Services,8158475,ZIHLM200888,['Information Services'],NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIH,2010,2436250,0.05222411234589808
"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online. Those algorithms and tools will enhance bioscience information retrieval, information extraction, summarization, and question answering.          n/a",Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database,7534822,R21RR024933,"['Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dictionary', 'Documentation', 'Flowcharts', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Index Medicus', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Systems', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man', 'Ontology', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Western Blotting', 'abstracting', 'base', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'tool']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R21,2009,179517,0.04045207577021108
"Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is a demonstrated community need for an annotated corpus consisting of the full texts of biomedical journal articles. There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated. Due to their central roles in training and testing language processing systems, the quality of the design and operational creation of annotated corpora place fundamental limits on what can be accomplished with such systems.

"Collective Intelligence, Knowledge Infrastructure, & High Performance Computing The Collective Intelligence, Knowledge Infrastructure, and High Performance Program, which  operates within the High Performance Computing and Informatics Office (HPCIO), Division of Computational Bioscience of CIT, is collaborating with NIH investigators to build a critical mass in collective intelligence that is envisioned to encompass a number of pertinent and related disciplines in biomedical research including semantic interoperability, knowledge engineering, computational linguistics, text and data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization.  The program is intended to foster advances in critical domains at NIH including biomedical and clinical informatics, translational research, proteomics research, genomics, systems biology, and portfolio analysis.  In 2009, collaborations in support of these goals included the following.  - The human salivary protein catalog has been made available online on a community-based Web portal developed by HPCIO, in collaboration with NIDCR, to enable scientists to add their own research data, share results, and discover new knowledge. This is a major step towards the discovery and use of saliva biomarkers to diagnose oral and systemic diseases.   - HPCIO has developed context-sensitive text-mining methodology for identifying High-Risk, High-Reward (HRHR) research based from NIH Summary Statements.  The method, which uses natural language processing to parse text and classify documents, has been successful in retrospective analysis of the most recent five-years summaries.  This work is being conducted in collaboration with Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives (DPCPSI), NIH Office of the Director (OD).   - HPCIO is developing a corpus of annotated NIH medical records for use in developing methods of document de-identification.  The goal is to create a gold standard that de-identification algorithms for use at NIH can be measured against.  This work, in collaboration with the Clinical Center, will enhance the availability of medical records stored within the Biomedical Translational Research Information System.    - HPCIO is working with the caBIG Clinical Trial Management System Workspace (in collaboration with NCI) to develop a Protocol Lifecycle Tracking (PLT) tool.  By providing real-time protocol status information on all relevant trials to clinicians and researchers, bottlenecks and latencies in protocol management can be identified and corrected by those responsible for conduct of a trail and the overall success of a clinical trial program.   - As a component of the Molecular Libraries Roadmap imitative, the Common Assay Reporting System (CARS) allows investigators and program directors to track the status of assay projects related information at each screening center within the Molecular Libraries Program Center Network (MLPCN). The system also provides a means for collecting, sharing and retrieving of bioassay information among the centers and program office at NIH.    - HPCIO is initiating a pilot endeavor with NCI to develop deep knowledge bases representing NCIs scientific portfolio.  The pilot will explore several different representation paradigms (which store not only scientific concepts but the relationships between concepts as well) to evaluate their effectiveness at various tasks including document categorization, clustering, and visualization.

"Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data This projects studies statistical learning machines as applied to biomedical and clinical prediction, probabilitiy assignment, regresssion, and ranking problems. The algorithms involved include Random Forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and variations of the boosting algorithm. These are all recently developed techniques orginally constructed by the machine learning community, and which are only now starting to see applications in biomedical problems. These methods were not designed through familiar parametric statistical reasoning, but using the more advanced methods of nonparametric density estimation, are known to be provably Bayes risk consistent. Hence, as the data set grows the methods do optimally classify cases and subjects, for example. As routinely applied to data collected by clinicians or biomedical researchers, these new techniques require modifications and enhancements appropriate to data collected from these alternate sources. In particular, we address the problem of (1) greatly unbalanced data sets, where the researcher typically has only a handful of positive cases and a great many negative cases, (2) the issue of accurate estimates of prediction error rates, where the researcher typically has a relatively small data set upon which to do both model fitting and testing, and (3) the interpretation of the means by which the prediction engine operates and the development of practical prognostic factors. These three problems are essential questions facing the use of modern prediction engines, but have been only lightly studied by the machine learning community. On the other hand, the rigorous methods of the mathematical statistics community have demonstrated the unusual versatility and flexibility of these methods. We have applied these statistical learning machine schemes to a wide variety of biological datasets, such as a 1,000K SNP data set on childhood-onset schizophrenia.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Textpresso: information retrieval and extraction system for biological literature    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We developed an information retrieval and extraction system that processes the full text of biological papers. The system, called Textpresso, separates text into sentences, labels words and phrases according to an ontology (an organized lexicon), and allows queries to be performed on a database of labeled sentences. The current ontology comprises approximately one hundred categories of terms, such as ""gene"", ""regulation"", ""human disease"", ""brain area"" etc., and also contains main Gene Ontology (GO) categories. Extraction of particular biological facts, such as gene-gene interactions, or the curation of GO cellular components, can be accelerated significantly by ontologies, with Textpresso automatically performing nearly as well as expert curators to identify sentences. Search engine for four literatures, C. elegans, Drosophila, Arabidopsis and Neuroscience have been established by us, and nine systems for other literatures have been developed by other groups around the world. The system will be further developed in many aspects. In collaboration with the respective model organism databases, we will set up literature search engine for zebrafish, rat and Dictyostelium and consider systems for important diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's and AIDS. We will improve the quality of searchable full text by carrying super- and subscripts as well as special character information, and recognizing subsections of a paper. Website and system enhancement will include synonym searches, better website customization features (""myTextpresso""), browsing and searching a paper taxonomy, implementation of batch queries and notification of search result changes due to corpus changes. We will offer webservices for Textpresso and maintain a public subversion system for the software. Named entity recognition algorithms will be implemented to find new terms for the ontology from full text. We will work on the problem of high specificity of terms in the lexica, which reduces recall, and enable searches for GO annotations. Strategies for (semi-) automated literature curation include installing a paper triage system and first pass curation to identify where in a paper which relevant data types can be found. Automated curation tasks include producing connections between a paper and a biological entity such as gene. We will develop learning algorithms that discover new categories and lexica in text. We will improve our curation strategy of developing specialized curation categories that are used to retrieve specific data, and develop corresponding curator interfaces to automate the processing pipeline from full text to database. We will research and implement new, more semantically oriented ways of searching by combining latent semantic indexing with new similarity measures. Machine learning algorithms for classifying sentences and extracting information will be implemented using hidden Markov models. A new approach of finding categories and lexica using graph theory will be investigated.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics.

"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities. We are now well into the era of broad use of semantic representation technology to support biomedical research, and at the cusp of the use of biomedical natural language processing software to create the enormous number of necessary formal representations automatically from biomedical texts. The results of the work during the last funding period have not only contributed    innovative and significant new methods, but have helped us identify a set of specific research issues we claim are now the rate-limiting factors in building an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. The aims of this competitive renewal are to address those factors, making it possible to scale our impressive results on intentionally narrow applications to much   larger (and more significant) tasks, specifically: (1) to create an enriched, relationally decomposed set of conceptual frames, hewing closely to multiple, community curated ontologies; (2) develop language  processing tools capable of recognizing and populating instances of those conceptual frames, and (3) develop systems for integrating and using diverse knowledge from multiple sources to generate scientific insights, focusing on the analysis of sets of dozens to hundreds of genes produced by diverse high-throughput methodologies.

"Biomedical Language Processing Writ Large:  Scaling to all of PubMedCentral    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Recent developments in text mining research, and in scientific publication, have brought us to the moment when the long-standing potential of natural language processing technology to benefit biomedical researchers may finally be realized. Technological advances, recent results in computational linguistics, maturation of biomedical ontology, and the advent of resources such as PubMedCentral have set the stage for an attempt at an integrated computational analysis of a large proportion of the full text biomedical literature. Such an analysis has the potential to dramatically extend the way that biomedical researchers can effectively use the scientific literature, particularly in the analysis of genome-scale datasets, broadly accelerating and increasing the efficiency of scientific discovery. We hypothesize that it is now possible to extract a wide variety of ontologically-grounded entities and relationships by processing the entire PubMedCentral document collection accurately and with good coverage, to use this extracted information to produce new genres of scientifically valuable tools and analysis techniques, and to demonstrate its utility in the analysis of genome-scale data. The challenges that we plan to overcome range from fundamental linguistic issues (e.g. cross- document coreference resolution) to high-performance computing (e.g. scaling up integrated processing to include millions of complex documents), to fielding practical systems that can exploit enormous knowledge-bases to accelerate the analysis of very large molecular data sets.              Project narrative Enormous amounts of biomedical information are now available in the PubMedCentral database, but computers cannot work with it because it is in the form of human-language text and humans can't read it all due to its large volume.

"Ontology-based Information Network to Support Vaccine Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since the introduction of Edward Jenner's smallpox vaccine in 1796, vaccines have proven invaluable for their ability to stimulate the immune system and to confer protection against pathogenic organisms. Progress in modern vaccine research has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in the number of vaccine-related papers in the published literature. It has become increasingly challenging to identify and annotate vaccine data from this large and diverse literature which no one scientist or team can fully master. Although vaccine databases exist that emphasize commercialized vaccines, no public central repository is available to store research data concerning commercial vaccines, vaccines in clinical trials, or vaccine candidates in early stages of development, in a fashion that render such data available for advanced analyses. To fill this need, we have developed VIOLIN (http://www.violinet.org), a web-based database system for annotation, storage, and analysis of published vaccine data. An ontology represents consensus-based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations, with associated definitions which are logically formulated in such a way as to promote automated reasoning. A bottleneck of vaccine research and further VIOLIN development is the lack of a vaccine ontology, which in turn makes a significant obstacle for vaccine data standardization, retrieval, integration, and advanced analysis and prediction. Our goal is to develop the community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO) and apply it to efficient vaccine literature mining and analysis of protective immune mechanisms. We will focus on two model pathogens: Escherichia coli and Brucella species. This project contains three specific aims: (1) develop a community-based Vaccine Ontology (VO), and apply it to establish a vaccine knowledgebase and to promote vaccine data integration and query through Semantic Web. The VO development will be achieved through collaboration with vaccine researchers, the Infectious Disease Ontology (IDO) Initiative, and the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO); (2) develop a VO-based natural language processing (NLP) system and apply it for more efficient retrieval of Brucella and E. coli vaccine information, automated annotation of journal articles with VO terms, and VO improvement. This task will be achieved by collaboration with the National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics (NCIBI). (3) analyze and predict vaccine targets and protective immune networks attributable to the interactions between host and vaccine. This will be achieved mainly by VO-based literature mining and a novel genome- and literature-based statistical methodology. This project will be implemented by a strong collaborative team and supported from a large user community. The Vaccine Ontology and its applications to literature mining and for studying protective immunity against Brucella spp. and E. coli will lay a strong foundation for further advanced informatics research on vaccines against infectious diseases in the post-genomics and information era.            Narrative: Vaccines stimulate the immune system and confer protection against pathogenic microorganisms. A bottleneck of vaccine research is the lack of an ontology (consensus- based controlled vocabularies of terms and relations) to ensure consistency of literature curation and support automated reasoning.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software. Narrative This project will help biomedical scientists manage, understand and communicate the complex information they must learn from scientific papers in multiple biomedical disciplines. As a demonstration of this work, we will build a comprehensive summary of research underlying brain circuits involved in stress.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7693803,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,280000,0.02876750363302456
"Onto-BioThesaurus: ontological representation of gene/protein names for biomedica    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The long-term goal of our research is to develop resources and tools for knowledge retrieval management in the biomedical domain. As the pace of biomedical research accelerates, researchers become more and more dependent on computers to manage the explosive amount of biomedical information being published. The high quality of many databases is guaranteed by database curators who extract and synthesize information stored in literature or other databases. It is important to accurately recognize biomedical entity names in text and map the identified names to corresponding records in biomedical databases. Usually, a biomedical database provides a list of names either entered by curators or extracted from other databases. Those names could be used to retrieve records from databases or map names to database records by NLP systems. However, there are several characteristics associated with biomedical entity names, namely: synonymy (i.e., different names refer to the same database entry), ambiguity (i.e., one name is associated with different entries), and novelty (i.e., names or entities are not present in databases or knowledge bases) which make the task of retrieving database records using names and the task of associating names in text to database records very daunting. Additionally, biomedical entities can appear in text as short forms (SFs) abbreviated from their long forms (LFs). The prevalent use of SFs representing biomedical entities is another challenge faced by end users and NLP applications because of the high ambiguity of SFs.       Recently, ontology-based knowledge management is becoming increasingly popular since ontologies provide formal, machine-processable, and human-interpretable representations of the biomedical entities and their relations. We hypothesize that biomedical ontologies can be used to reduce the difficulty associated with retrieving records using names or mapping names in text to database records. Specific aims and the corresponding hypotheses are: i) develop onto-BioThesaurus by enriching BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies (Hypothesis: aligning gene/protein names to gene/protein-related ontologies can reduce the complexity associated with gene/protein names); ii) harvest synonyms for gene/protein classes and entities from online resources and text (Hypothesis: harvesting synonyms especially gene/protein SFs is critical since SFs are frequently used to represent gene/protein entities); iii) build a web user interface for gene/protein names and entries search and query through ontology-enabled onto-BioThesaurus (Hypothesis: enhancing BioThesaurus with gene/protein-related ontologies would enable us to build heuristic rules to enable machine reasoning); and iv) evaluate and distribute research methods/outcome (Hypothesis: evaluating and distributing research methods/outcome are critical to advance both basic and applied biomedical science.            The proposed research is critical for biomedical knowledge retrieval and management. It serves as one of the foundation for storing, retrieving, and extracting knowledge and information in the biomedical domain.

Among the NLMs intramural programs that contribute to its national biomedical information services are the following examples:  PubMed/MEDLINE:  PubMed, which incorporates MEDLINE, is NLMs premier bibliographic database with over 19 million references to biomedical journal articles.  MEDLINE articles are indexed by experts using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) controlled vocabulary, updated annually.  In FY2009, more than 700,000 new indexed citations were added.  PubMed Central:  The PubMed Central  archive of over 1.8 million full-text journal articles is central to the  NIH effort to make accessible the published results of research it supports.  In FY09,  NLM enhanced the NIH Manuscript Submission system (NIHMS) by which authors can submit articles to PubMed Central in compliance with the NIH Public Access Policy.  NLM has also made PMC software available to archiving organizations in the UK and Canada.   MedlinePlus and MedlinePlus en espaol:  MedlinePlus and the Spanish language MedlinePlus en espaol provide access to consumer health information on more than 800 diseases and conditions.  Recent enhancements included improved search capabilities, addition of summary information, and expansion to include information in more than 40 languages.   Clinical Trials:  ClinicalTrials.gov contains information on more than 79,000 clinical research studies in more than 169 countries, with hundreds added each week. It was significantly expanded to respond to new clinical trial registration and results reporting requirements established by the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (PL 110-85).  In FY09, some 32,000 trials were registered, raising the total to 79,000.  Since NLM implemented the results database required by the law in September 2008, summary results of more than 880 clinical trials have been added.  In September 2009, the previously optional adverse events module of the results database became mandatory. Toxicology and Environmental Health:  The Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) is a primary reference for toxicologists, poison control centers, public health administrators, physicians and other environmental health professionals, and includes databases such as Hazardous Substances Data Bank, TOXLINE, GENE-TOX, and the Toxic Release Inventory.    Influenza Virus Resource: The Influenza Virus Resource contains influenza virus sequences and enables researchers to compare different virus strains, identify genetic factors that determine the virulence of virus strains, and look for new therapeutic, diagnostic and vaccine targets.

Some areas of emphasis in FY09  augmenting the Short Read Archive of more than 400GB  of raw sequence data derived from massively parallel sequencing technologies; augmenting dbGAP with more than 20 GWAS studies and developing a new access system using the high-efficiency FASP protocol; and continuing the discovery initiative to alleviate difficulties in finding relevant information in diverse resources and develop interface improvements such as Releated Reviews and Patient Drug Information.   Outreach: Promoting Public Awareness and Access  Consumer health websites and the NIH MedlinePlus Magazine transmit the latest useful research findings in lay language. In FY09, NLM increased  distribution of the magazine to 600,000, launched a  Spanish language edition, Salud!, and introduced online versions the magazines.  Special population websites address specific minority health concerns in various racial and ethnic groups. NLM   outreach programs enhance awareness of its information services. Special attention is given to minority groups and other underserved populations, including African American, Hispanic, and Native American communities, as well as health professionals serving minority populations and practicing in rural and inner city communities. In FY 2009, dozens of community-based projects were funded across the country.  Health Services Research  NICHSR improves access to health services research through information systems such as: HSRProj, a database covering over 5000 ongoing or recently completed health services research projects; HSRR (Health Services and Sciences Research Resources), a  database of research datasets, instruments and software relevant to health services research, behavioral and social sciences, and public health; and HSTAT (Health Services/Technology Assessment Text), a full-text database including evidence reports, guidelines technology assessments, consensus statements, and treatment protocols.  Advanced Information Systems, Data Standards and Research Tools  In FY 2009, LHC and NCBI continued to conduct research in biomedical informatics and computational biology information systems, tested the effectiveness of medical informatics interventions, and developed new scientific computing tools. To cite a few examples, intramural researchers developed tools that support standards-based personal health records; applied natural language processing methods to extract information from biomedical literature; improved automatic detection of gene and protein names in scientific text; and provided software tools that enabled rapid expansion of the PubChem database. NLM made substantial contributions toward standardized reporting of genetic variations and clinical interpretation of genetic test results by augmenting RefSeqGene and dbSNP; expanding the LOINC ; and launching the Newborn Screening Coding and Terminology Guide to enable more effective use of newborn screening test results.   Health Data Standards: As the central coordinating body for clinical terminology standards within DHHS, NLM supports nationwide implementation of an interoperable health information technology infrastructure. NLM develops or licenses key clinical terminologies and problem lists designated as standards for U.S. health information exchange. The Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, with more than 7.7 million concept names from more than 100 vocabularies, is a distribution mechanism for standard code sets and vocabularies used in health data systems. NLM also produces RxNorm, a standard clinical drug vocabulary; supports the LOINC nomenclature for laboratory tests and patient observations; and promotes international adoption of the SNOMED CT clinical terminology. In FY09, NLM released the first version of the CORE Problem List Subset of SNOMED CT and launched the Newborn Screening Codes and Terminology Guide, which provides a standard framework for reporting the results of newborn screening tests. n/a",National Biomedical Information Services,7970410,ZIHLM200888,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'African American', 'Amendment', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biotechnology', 'Blast Cell', 'Canada', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethnic group', 'Family', 'Fellow of American College of Physicians', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genbank', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hazardous Substances', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology', 'Healthcare', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitals', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Influenza', 'Information Centers', 'Information Dissemination', 'Information Management', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval Systems', 'Information Services', 'Information Specialists', 'Information Systems', 'Information Technology', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Laws', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'MEDLINE', 'Manuscripts', 'MeSH Thesaurus', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Names', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Personal Health Records', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Poison Control Centers', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Rural', 'SNOMED Clinical Terms', 'Science', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Terminology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Toxicology Data Network', 'Toxics Release Inventory', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Underserved Population', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Update', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical information system', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'genome wide association study', 'health disparity', 'health information technology', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'influenza virus resource', 'influenzavirus', 'inner city', 'instrument', 'journal article', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'metathesaurus', 'minority health', 'named group', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'racial and ethnic', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'scientific computing', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIH,2009,250355446,0.0511582312823318
"A Resource for Biomedical Ontologies and Knowledge Bases    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       For more than two decades, our laboratory has been studying technology to develop, manage, and use formal descriptions of biomedical concepts.

"Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge Today, ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators, especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require the command of a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of experiments. In fact, ontologies are proliferating in all areas of biomedical research, offering both challenges and opportunities. One of the principal challenges of this field stems from the fact that ontologies are developed in isolation, rendering it impossible to move, for instance, from genes to organisms, to diseases, to drugs. The National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) represents a fundamental endeavor in the collection, coordination and distribution of biomedical ontologies and offers an unparalleled opportunity to combine these biomedical ontologies into a single search space where genetic, anatomic, molecular and pharmacological information can be seamlessly explored and exploited as a holistic representation of biomedical knowledge. Unfortunately, ontology integration using standard means of manual curation is a labor intensive task, unable to scale up and keep up with the current growth rate of biomedical ontologies. We have developed a systematic framework for automated ontology engineering based on information theory, and we have successfully applied it to the analysis and engineering of Gene Ontology (GO), the development gene and protein databases, and the identification of peripheral biomarkers of disease progression and drug response. This project brings together a unique group of competences, ranging from ontology engineering, statistical signal processing, bioinformatics, cancer research, and clinical pharmacogenomics, to develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine and integrate biomedical ontologies and implement it as part of the NCBO architecture Ontologies are critical instruments for biomedical investigators especially in those areas, such as cancer research, that require a vast amount of information and a systemic approach to the design and interpretation of their experiments. In collaboration with the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO), this project will develop a principled method, grounded on the mathematics of information theory, to automatically combine biomedical ontologies. As a result, this project will integrate biomedical knowledge along dimensions that are today isolated and, in so doing, it will empower investigators with a new holistic understanding of disease, it will fast track the clinical  translation of biological discoveries, and it will change the approach to discovery, especially for those diseases that, like cancer, require a systemic view of their biological mechanisms.",Automated Integration of Biomedical Knowledge,7558468,R01HG004836,"['Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineered Gene', 'Engineering', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Information Theory', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Proliferating', 'Protein Databases', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'empowered', 'graphical user interface', 'insight', 'instrument', 'open source', 'programs', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'stem']",NHGRI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2009,428078,0.050933060573656
"Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of ontologies that define entities and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage the burgeoning data that are pervasive in biology and medicine. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high-throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. To date, these groups of ontology developers have been limited by the lack of methods and tools that facilitate distributed, collaborative engineering of large-scale ontologies and vocabularies. In this proposal, we outline three specific aims. First, we will explore basic computational methods that are essential for collaborative ontology engineering. We will investigate methods for representing diverse collaborative workflows, information about changes and concept history, trust, and provenance, and for recording decision making and design rationale. Empirical analysis of existing ontology-development projects will inform our construction of models for collaborative development workflows that will guide the processes of authoring, reviewing, and curating biomedical ontologies. Second, we will use the results from our first specific aim to build cProtigi, a set of robust, customizable, interactive tools to support distributed users in their collaborative work to build and edit terminologies and ontologies. Third, we will evaluate our work in the context of real-world, large-scale ontology-engineering projects, including the autism ontology of the National Database for Autism Research; the 11th revision of the WHO's International Classification of Diseases; the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations, under development by a wide range of NIH-supported researchers; and BiomedGT, under development by NCI. It is no longer feasible to imagine that investigators can create biomedical ontologies working independently. The collaborative methods that we will study and the tools that we will build will lead to expanded opportunities to support the diverse data- and knowledge-intensive activities that pervade BISTI, the CTSAs, the NCBCs, and myriad biomedical initiatives that require robust, scaleable ontologies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The knowledge-based nature of modern medicine requires the use of ontologies and terminologies to process and integrate data. Ontology development itself becomes a collaborative process, with members of the larger research community contributing to and commenting on emerging ontologies. We plan to extend the Protigi ontology editor-the most widely used ontology editor today, with almost 100,000 registered users-to support collaborative development of ontologies and to evaluate the new tools by deploying them at the World Health Organization for the development of ICD-11 and in other settings.             n/a",Collaborative Development of Biomedical Ontologies and Terminologies,7565504,R01GM086587,"['Adopted', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maintenance', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'NCI Thesaurus', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outsourcing', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Published Comment', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forging', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,529858,0.038688742968528485
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7684604,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'natural language', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2009,639134,0.06776773073088131
"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics. The efficient knowledge acquisition and management will enhance biomedical research regarding the mechanisms of diseases and drug discovery.          n/a",Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation,8133305,R01LM009153,[' '],NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,109860,0.000619523051893056
"Towards the Building of a Comprehensive Searchable Biological Experiment Database    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The rapid growth of the biomedical literature and the expansion in disciplinary biomedical research, heralded by high-throughput genome sciences and technologies, have overwhelmed scientists who attempt to assimilate information necessary for their research. The widespread adoption of title/abstract word searches, such as highly desirable the National Library of Medicine's PubMed system, has provided the first major advance in the way bioscientists find relevant publications since the origin of Index Medicus in 1879 (Hunter and Cohen 2006). The importance of developing valid information retrieval systems for bioscientists has led to the development of information systems worldwide (e.g., Arrowsmith (Smalheiser and Swanson 1998), BioText (Hearst 2003), GeneWays (Friedman et al. 2001; Rzhetsky et al. 2004), iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia 2005), and BioMedQA (Lee et al. 2006a), and annotated databases (e.g., SWISSPROT, OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2005) and BIND (Alfarano et al. 2005)).      However, most of information systems target only text information and fail to provide access to other important data such as images (e.g., figures). More than any other documentation, figures usually represent the ""evidence"" of discovery in the biomedical literature. Full-text biological articles nearly always incorporate figures/images that are the crucial content of the biomedical literature. Our examination of biological articles in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) revealed the occurrence of 5.2 images per article on average (Yu and Lee 2006a). Biologists need to access image data to validate research facts and to formulate or to test novel research hypotheses. It has been evaluated that textual statements reported in literature frequently are noisy (i.e., containing ""false facts"") (Krauthammer et al. 2002). Capturing images that are experimental ""evidence"" to support the textual ""fact"" will benefit bioscience information systems, databases, and bioscientists.      Unfortunately, this wealth of information remains virtually inaccessible without automatic systems to organize these images. We propose the development of advanced natural language processing (NLP) tools to semantically organize images. We hypothesize that text that associated with images semantically entails the image content and natural language processing techniques can be developed to accurately associate the text to their images. Furthermore, we hypothesize that images can be semantically organized by categories specified by standard biological ontology, and that natural language processing approaches can accurately assign the ontological categories to images.      Our specific aims are:      Aim 1: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for identifying textual statements that correspond to images in full-text articles. We will develop different approaches for two types of the associations. We will first propose rule-based and statistical approaches to identify the associated text that appears in the full-text articles. We will then develop hybrid approaches to link sentences in abstracts to images in the body of the articles.      Aim 2: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic classification of experimental results into categories (e.g., Western-Blot, PCR verification, etc) specified in the experimental protocol Protocol-Online.      We will explore the use of dictionary-based, rule-based, image classification, and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      Aim 3: To develop and evaluate NLP techniques for automatic assignment of Gene Ontology categories to experiments, which will provide a knowledge-based organization of experiments according to biological properties (e.g., catalytic activity). We will develop statistical and machine-learning approaches for accomplishing this aim.      We found that most of the images that appear in full-text biological articles are figure images (Yu and Lee 2006a) and we therefore focus on figure images only in this proposal. The deliverable of Specific Aim 1 will be an effective user-interface BioEx from which bioscientists can access images directly from sentences in the abstracts. BioEx has the promise of improvement over the traditional single-document-per-article format that has dominated bioscience publications since the first scientific article appeared in 1665 (Gross 2002). The deliverables of Specific Aim 2 and 3 will be open-source algorithms and tools that accurately map images to categories specified by the Gene Ontology and the Protocol Online.

There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated. Due to their central roles in training and testing language processing systems, the quality of the design and operational creation of annotated corpora place fundamental limits on what can be accomplished with such systems. Although there has been valuable work done on annotating abstracts, there are important differences between abstracts and full-text articles from a text mining perspective, and annotation of full-text journal articles has been negligible. Workers in both the biological (especially model organism database curation) community and the text mining community have independently pointed out the importance of processing the full text of scientific publications if the biomedical world is to be able to fully utilize text mining. We propose to build a large, fully annotated corpus consisting of full texts of biomedical journal articles. Additionally, previous biomedical corpus annotation efforts have often utilized ad hoc ontologies that have limited their utility outside of the groups that created them. We will ensure community acceptability by annotating with respect to community-consensus ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the UMLS. Since the task involves expensive human labor, efficiency is a key issue in creating corpora. For this reason, we propose to build a team that includes the builder of the largest semantically annotated corpus to date, one of the pioneers of the model organism databases, and an already-assembled cadre of experienced linguistic and domain-expert annotators.             n/a",Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining,7495148,G08LM009639,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Rate', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'text searching', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,G08,2008,132030,0.0830031795411583
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7498449,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2008,153203,0.039335907505390656
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7429768,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,534463,0.008792883479618705
"Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data This projects studies statistical learning machines as applied to biomedical and clinical prediction, probabilitiy assignment, regresssion, and ranking problems. The algorithms involved include Random Forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and variations of the boosting algorithm. These are all recently developed techniques orginally constructed by the machine learning community, and which are only now starting to see applications in biomedical problems. These methods were not designed through familiar parametric statistical reasoning, but using the more advanced methods of nonparametric density estimation, are known to be provably Bayes risk consistent. Hence, as the data set grows the methods do optimally classify cases and subjects, for example. As routinely applied to data collected by clinicians or biomedical researchers, these new techniques require modifications and enhancements appropriate to data collected from these alternate sources. In particular, we address the problem of (1) greatly unbalanced data sets, where the researcher typically has only a handful of positive cases and a great many negative cases, (2) the issue of accurate estimates of prediction error rates, where the researcher typically has a relatively small data set upon which to do both model fitting and testing, and (3) the interpretation of the means by which the prediction engine operates and the development of practical prognostic factors. These three problems are essential questions facing the use of modern prediction engines, but have been only lightly studied by the machine learning community. On the other hand, the rigorous methods of the mathematical statistics community have demonstrated the unusual versatility and flexibility of these methods. We have applied these statistical learning machine schemes to a wide variety of biological datasets, such as a 1,000K SNP data set on childhood-onset schizophrenia.

"ADAPTIVE PERSONALIZED INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR BIOLOGISTS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose development of an adaptive, personalizable, information management tool, which can be configured and trained by an individual biologist to most effectively exploit the particular knowledge bases and document collections that are most useful for him or her. The proposed tool represents a novel approach for monitoring scientific progress in biology, which has become a formidable task. We will exploit recent advances in machine learning and database systems to develop a useful approximation to a personalized biological knowledge base f.i.i.e., single information resource that would include all the knowledge sources on which a biologist relies. More specifically, we propose a scheme for loosely integrating both structured information and unstructured text, and then querying the integrated information using easily-formulated similarity queries. The system will also learn from every episode in which a biologist seeks information. The research team on this project includes a computer scientist and two biologists. The proposed work will make systems for monitoring scientific progress in biology more effective.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics.

"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology. Therefore, we propose to test the following hypothesis: Creation of large, high-quality, biomedical corpora from multiple genres will lead to significant improvements in the performance of biomedical text mining systems and the creation of new approaches to text mining tasks. Specific aims include constructing several large corpora covering a range of genres and incorporating a rich knowledge representation; identifying factors that affect differential performance on full text versus abstracts; and developing new methods for language processing, especially of full text. Because improvements in the ability to automatically extract information from many textual genres will assist scientists and clinicians in the crucial task of keeping up with the burgeoning biomedical literature, the potential public health impact is quite large.          n/a",Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts,7488396,R01LM009254,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Arts', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Range', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'concept', 'improved', 'information organization', 'interest', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'novel strategies', 'prototype', 'size', 'technology development', 'text searching', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,268713,0.07166718927875625
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-base    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       In the three years since the original proposal was submitted, the claims we made about the impending readiness of knowledge-based approaches and natural language processing to address pressing problems of information overload in molecular biology have been resoundingly confirmed, and such methods have become increasingly accepted within the computational bioscience and systems biology communities.

"BioScholar: a Biomedical Knowledge Engineering framework based on the published l    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Studying the primary research literature is a universal, primary activity for biomedical scientists. It underlies scientists' understanding of their subject and strengthens their capability to plan, execute, and interpret experiments. This proposal is concerned with the maintenance and continued development of software that supports scientists in their scholarly work. Our goal is to develop a knowledge engineering platform (called `BioScholar') to permit a single graduate student or postdoctoral worker to design, build, curate, and maintain a Knowledge Base (KB) for the literature of interest to a specific laboratory. This continues a previous software development project that was funded by the National Library of Medicine (LM 07061). We will continue to maintain the software using modern software engineering tools and approaches, whilst making it fully interoperable with a widely used ontology engineering platform (Protege /OWL). We will also develop the systems' existing capabilities to assist scientists with management of bibliographic data (citation information and full-text PDF articles). We will further develop tools to allow researchers to annotate PDF files with highlights, simple comments and with structured data. We will then use this annotation framework to drive the process of constructing knowledge bases using Protege/OWL (a widely used ontology editor). We will then incorporate Information Extraction (IE) techniques from modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) to improve the efficiency of this curation process. The NLP methods we use are based on the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model which is considered state-of-the-art amongst NLP researchers. Finally, the most research-oriented component of this proposal is the development of a new methodology for knowledge representation and reasoning in biomedicine based on experimental design, involving experimental controls, independent and dependent variables, statistical significance and correlation between variables. This representation will be (a) understandable to experimental scientists, (b) lightweight, (c) versatile, and (d) capable of supporting inference between experiments. During the course of this project, we will build a KB for the world-leading neuroendocrinology laboratory of Prof. Alan Watts at University Southern California. Prof. Watts' work is concerned with the study of catecholaminergic control of the stress response, drawing on research from a large number of different fields (anatomy, physiology, molecular biology, etc.). After developing this KB, we will test its validity using subjective methods (questionnaires and interviews), and objective experiments (`mock exams' to see if students' performance with test questions based on comprehension of the primary literature). We will release all findings and tools to the biomedical community as research papers and open-source software.

"Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       With the completion of the Human Genome Project, there is a need to translate genome-era discoveries into clinical utility. One difficulty in making bench-to-bedside translations with gene-expression and proteomic data is our current inability to relate these findings with each other and with clinical measurements. A translational researcher studying a particular biological process using microarrays or proteomics will want to gather as many relevant publicly-available data sets as possible, to compare findings. Translational investigators wanting to relate clinical or chemical data with multiple genomic or proteomic measurements will want to find and join related data sets. Unfortunately, finding and joining relevant data sets is particularly challenging today, as the useful annotations of this data are still represented only by unstructured free-text, limiting its secondary use. A question we have sought to answer is whether prior investments in biomedical ontologies can provide leverage in determining the context of genomic data in an automated manner, thereby enabling integration of gene expression and proteomic data and the secondary use of genomic data in multiple fields of research beyond those for which the data sets were originally targeted. The three specific aims to address this question are to (1) develop tools that comprehensively map contextual annotations to the largest biomedical ontology, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), built and supported by the National Library of Medicine, validate, and disseminate the mappings, (2) execute a four-pronged strategy to evaluate experiment-concept mappings, and (3) apply experiment-context mappings to find and integrate data within and across microarray and proteomics repositories. To keep these tools relevant to biomedical investigators, we have included three Driving Biological Projects (DBPs), in the domains of breast cancer, organ transplantation, and T-cell biology. To accomplish these DBPs, our tools and mappings will be used to find and join experimental data within and across microarray and proteomic repositories. Having DBPs to address will focus our development on a set of scalable tools that can access and analyze experimental data covering a large variety of diseases. Through our advisory committee of world-renowned NIH-funded investigators, we will ensure that our findings will have broad applicability and are useful to a wide variety of biomedical researchers.          n/a",Integrating Microarray and Proteomic Data by Ontology-based Annotation,7467204,R01LM009719,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Human Genome Project', 'Improve Access', 'International', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Text', 'Time', 'Today', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Writing', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'biomedical informatics', 'concept', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'repository', 'research study', 'text searching', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,280000,0.02876750363302456
"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7502636,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2008,640921,0.06776773073088131
"Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       There is a demonstrated community need for an annotated corpus consisting of the full texts of biomedical journal articles. There are many reasons to believe that the rate-limiting factor impeding progress in biomedical language processing today is the lack of availability of the right kind of expertly annotated data. An annotated corpus is a collection of texts with information about the meaning or structure associated with particular textual elements. Annotated corpora are a critical component of biomedical natural language processing research in two ways. First, most contemporary approaches to language processing rely at least in part on machine learning or statistical models. Such systems must be ""trained"" on sets of examples with known outputs, so annotated corpora provide the training data vital to the construction of modern NLP systems. Second, annotated corpora provide the gold standard by which various approaches to particular text mining tasks are evaluated. Due to their central roles in training and testing language processing systems, the quality of the design and operational creation of annotated corpora place fundamental limits on what can be accomplished with such systems. Although there has been valuable work done on annotating abstracts, there are important differences between abstracts and full-text articles from a text mining perspective, and annotation of full-text journal articles has been negligible. Workers in both the biological (especially model organism database curation) community and the text mining community have independently pointed out the importance of processing the full text of scientific publications if the biomedical world is to be able to fully utilize text mining. We propose to build a large, fully annotated corpus consisting of full texts of biomedical journal articles. Additionally, previous biomedical corpus annotation efforts have often utilized ad hoc ontologies that have limited their utility outside of the groups that created them. We will ensure community acceptability by annotating with respect to community-consensus ontologies such as the Gene Ontology and the UMLS. Since the task involves expensive human labor, efficiency is a key issue in creating corpora. For this reason, we propose to build a team that includes the builder of the largest semantically annotated corpus to date, one of the pioneers of the model organism databases, and an already-assembled cadre of experienced linguistic and domain-expert annotators.             n/a",Construction of a Full Text Corpus for Biomedical Text Mining,7301251,G08LM009639,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body of uterus', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'MEDLINE', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Rate', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Today', 'Training', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'text searching', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,G08,2007,130432,0.0830031795411583
"Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an invaluable resource for the biomedical community.   One of the intended uses of the UMLS Metathesaurus is to support the translation of terms from a source terminology into terms in a target terminology. It is evident from the research literature on the UMLS that users generally need to perform more broader types of ""translations"" that involve finding terms with closest meaning to source term (mapping), finding terms that are related to source term and can serve as proxy for various functions (e.g. information retrieval, knowledge discovery) or finding target terms that satisfy some structural or semantic constraint (e.g. information theoretic distance). The methods for finding such ""translations"" or connections between terms in Meta (other than the case of one-to-one synonymy) are not at all clear. Previous attempts to exploit such connections have depended on either manual selection of relevant connections, or problem-specific algorithms that use expert knowledge about the relative suitability of various inter-concept relationships. We believe that machine learning techniques offer automated, generalizable approaches that are appropriate for use with the UMLS, given the large set of potential connections and the need for a problem-independent approach. We hypothesize that learning strategies that exploit the relational features, scale free properties and probabilistic dependencies of connections in the UMLS will identify meaningful inter-term relationships and that a combined approach will perform better across different problem domains when compared to any of the approaches in isolation. We will evaluate the proposed learning algorithms with training connections from a variety of problem domains in biomedicine. We will disseminate the successful algorithms via the UMLS Knowledge Source API toolkit for mining and visualizing the connections. We believe that the UMLS provides a unique fertile ground to develop novel semantic relational mining methods and advance our understanding of mining large biomedical concept graphs.             n/a",Semantic and Machine Learning Methods for Mining Connections in the UMLS,7299922,R21LM009638,"['Algorithms', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Social Network', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical resource', 'concept', 'interest', 'metathesaurus', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'novel', 'success']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2007,181125,0.039335907505390656
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges adsing from the proliferation of high- throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent iadvances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB. n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7473405,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evaluation', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Information Resources Management', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Metric System', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plug-in', 'Proteins', 'Purpose', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'SwissProt', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'concept', 'data integration', 'gene function', 'heuristics', 'instrumentation', 'knowledge base', 'success', 'technology development', 'tool']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,234058,-0.0012357301267371965
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7257857,R01LM008635,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Improve Access', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Side', 'Source', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical application', 'concept', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'medical specialties', 'model organisms databases', 'open source', 'research and development', 'tool']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2007,529014,0.008792883479618705
"Statistical Learning for Biomedical Data This projects studies statistical learning machines as applied to biomedical and clinical prediction, probabilitiy assignment, regresssion, and ranking problems. The algorithms involved include Random Forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and variations of the boosting algorithm. These are all recently developed techniques orginally constructed by the machine learning community, and which are only now starting to see applications in biomedical problems. As the methods were not designed through statistical reasoning or routinely applied to data collected by clinicians or biomedical researchers, these new techniques require modifications and enhancements appropriate to data collected from these alternate sources. In particular, we address the problem of (1) greatly unbalanced data sets, where the researcher typically has only a handful of positive cases and a great many negative cases, (2) the issue of accurate estimates of prediction error rates, where the researcher typically has a relatively small data set upon which to do both model fitting and testing, and (3) the interpretation of the means by which the prediction engine operates and the development of practical prognostic factors. These three problems are essential questions facing the use of modern prediction engines, but have been only lightly studied by the machine learning community.

"New Machine Learning Methods for Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In the past few years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase of the amount of data available to biomedical research. An example is the recent advances of high-throughput biotechnologies, making it possible to access genome-wide gene expressions. To address biomedical issues at molecular levels, extraction of the relevant information from massive data of complex structures is essential. This calls for advanced mechanisms for statistical prediction and inference, especially in genomic discovery and prediction, where statistical uncertainty involved in a discovery process is high. The proposed approach focuses on the development of mixture model-based and large margin approaches in semisupervised and unsupervised learning, motivated from biomedical studies in gene discovery and prediction. In particular, we propose to investigate how to improve accuracy and efficiency of mixture model-based and large margin learning systems in generalization. In addition, we will develop innovative methods taking the structure of sparseness and the grouping effect into account to battle the curse of dimensionality, and blend them with the new learning tools. A number of technical issues will be investigated, including: a) developing model selection criteria and performing automatic feature selection, especially when the number of features greatly exceeds that of samples; b) developing large margin approaches for multi-class learning, with most effort towards sparse as well as structured learning; c) implementing efficient computation for real-time applications, and d) analyzing two biological datasets for i) gene function discovery and prediction for E. coli, and ii) new class discovery and prediction for BOEC samples; e) developing public-domain software.

"Automatic Literature-based Protein Annotation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Knowledge of protein function serves as a corner stone for biomedical research, which is fundamental for understanding biologic systems, the mechanism of disease and ultimately the human health. Decades of biomedical research has accumulated a great wealth of such knowledge available in the form of biomedical literatures. An important task of biomedical informatics is to acquire and represent the knowledge from free text of literatures and transform it to languages that are understandable by computational agents, so that the knowledge can be stored, retrieved and used for knowledge discovery. Currently, all protein annotations are assigned manually which, unfortunately, is extremely labor-intense and cannot keep up the pace of the growth of information. Indeed, with the completion of genome sequences of several model organisms, manual annotation of proteins has already become a major bottleneck between large number of proteins and exploding amount information in biomedical literatures. In this application, we propose to develop methods to facilitate automatic annotation of protein functions based on the functional information buried in the biomedical literature. The proposed methods adapt and extend the state of art probabilistic semantic analysis, information retrieval and machine learning methodologies, which serve as principled approaches to modeling uncertainties in natural language text. The project will develop algorithmic building blocks for a future automatic annotation system such that, when given a brief description of a protein (e.g., a protein name and symbol), it will be capable of retrieving relevant literature articles about the protein, extracting biological concepts from the articles and mapping the concept to a controlled vocabulary. We envision that achieving these goals will result in advances with broader impact which not only facilitate automatic protein annotation but also for biomedical literature indexing-one of the important area of biomedical informatics.

"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology.

"Text Mining Point Mutations for Genetic Diagnosis Array Text mining applications seek to alleviate the problems with identifying, searching, and extracting relevant information from large sets of literature. The goal of this proposal is to create a text mining application to extract protein point mutations from biomedical literature. The developed application will be used to extract point mutations from literature discussing human genetic disorders, and the retrieved database of point mutations used to design a DMA microarray chip for prenatal genetic diagnosis. First, the text mining application will be developed using machine learning and statistical natural language processing techniques. Second, the point mutation mining application will be applied to a large set of literature related to genetic disorders, and the retrieved point mutations deposited in an electronic database. This collection of point mutations will be examined to find polymorphisms in genes that are markers for genetic disorders. These polymorphic positions in the human genome will be gathered and used to design a DMA microarray chip that can genotype tens of thousands of single nucelotide polymorphisms.

"Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We hypothesize that there are significant synergies between the applications of biomedical ontologies and of biomedical language processing (BLP) which can be used to improve the quality and scope of both activities. A growing body of work suggests such synergies might exist, but there has yet to be a systematic exploration of their potential. We propose to carry out a focused effort to explore both the potential for, and obstacles to, the mutual application of biomedical ontologies and biomedical language processing. To provide immediate biological relevance to our work, we propose to focus on the topics of autoimmune and pulmonary disease. We group our proposed explorations into three specific aims: (1) Create novel tools and approaches for the application and maintenance of biomedical ontologies, based on an assessment of the processes and tools used for the ontological annotation of textual corpora in the biomedical language processing community. Particularly, we will focus on the creation of new methods for effective search through large ontologies, compositional approaches to annotation, effective capture of the evidence underlying annotations, and the use of automated suggestions for manual confirmation. (2) Evaluate the utility of BLP tools and techniques when applied to terms and definitions of biomedical ontologies, both to enrich and interconnect orthogonal ontologies, and to provide quality assurance and quality control mechanisms. Particularly, we propose to develop and evaluate methods for connecting terms within and across ontologies, for assessing completeness of an ontology against the literature, and for implementing automatically executable measures of ontology quality. (3) Compare the differences between annotations produced by manual procedures and those produced by automated BLP methods for completeness and correctness. Based on the resulting data, produce guidelines for the optimal interplay between manual and automatic procedures for producing broad, accurate and useful knowledge-bases. Because ontologies are the central organizing tool of the model organism databases, improvements in their quality and in the ease and efficiency of their use will have a major effect on the model organism databases, speed the translational process generally, and create a potentially large public health impact.          n/a",Ontologies and Biomedical Language Processing,7364235,R01GM083649,"['Address', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automated Annotation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Body of uterus', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Genes', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Immunology', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Ontology', 'Peer Review', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Production', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Representations, Knowledge (Computer)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Speed', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gene function', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'language processing', 'model organisms databases', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2007,631600,0.06776773073088131
"A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource DESCRIPTION:    The long-term aim of this project is to advance clinical care and biomedical research by establishing a natural language processing (NLP) resource for the biomedical community. A major bottleneck for development of automated tools for clinical applications and biomedical research is that most of the data and knowledge occur in the form of text, resulting in a lack of coded data. This NLP resource will make possible a host of automated applications by enabling high throughput access to coded biomedical knowledge and data. The foundation of this resource will be the MedLEE NLP system, which has been used operationally for almost a decade in healthcare settings for a broad range of applications that have proven to be valuable for clinical care. The NLP resource will also include BioMedLEE (a derivative of MedLEE), which encodes genotypic-phenotypic (GP) relations in the scientific literature. It currently focuses on GP relations associated with cancer and infectious diseases, and is being used to organize the extracted information to facilitate research, curation, and ontological development within model organism databases. This proposal will enable us to 1) disseminate our NLP resource to the community, 2) conduct technological research and development (R&D) to facilitate expansion and adaptation of the resource to new applications and specialties, 3) conduct R&D of tools that facilitate use of the extracted data and knowledge after coding, and 4) promote the resource, and provide service to users in the form of technical support, documentation, and tutorials. MedLEE and BioMedLEE are extendable systems that encompass the clinical and scientific communities. The dissemination of a proven NLP system that is applicable to the entire biomedical community provides an exceptional opportunity for multiple developers and researchers to work to unleash the true potential of NLP technology, increasing development of applications that aim to enhance scientific research and improve all levels of health. n/a",A Biomedical Natural Language Processing Resource,7075417,R01LM008635,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated medical record system', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'health science research', 'high throughput technology', 'human data']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,544814,0.008792883479618705
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,7123058,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2006,611872,-0.0007952169577382581
"Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two previous stages of this project, both funded by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences and carried out successfully, we developed GeneWays, a completely automated system that efficiently distills information about molecular interactions from an astronomical number of full-text biomedical articles. The next logical stage of the project is to carry this system from the computational laboratory into a practical, useful, and even indispensable tool that researchers can use to solve complex problems currently posed in experimental medicine and biology. The central hypothesis of our work on GeneWays has been that our computational tools will generate biological predictions of a quality sufficiently high that the biomedical community will invest in serious experimental validation. Specifically, we propose the following. 1. We will improve significantly the precision and recall of the GeneWays system. 2. We will develop and implement a probabilistic belief-network formalism?a belief-graph relative of the Bayesian network formalism that allows us to place and update beliefs on both the vertices and the edges of the graph for probabilistic reasoning over the large collection of facts in the GeneWays database. We will develop and implement a coordinated collection of methods for computing and updating beliefs on individual nodes and edges of the belief graph. 3. We will develop and implement a mathematical framework for incorporating pathway information into a genetic- linkage analysis formalism in such a way that each piece of pathway knowledge includes a specified degree of confidence. 4. We will process an enormous collection of texts, such as open-access biomedical journals, PubMed abstracts, and the GeneWays corpus, and thus will build a comprehensive GeneHighWays database. We will make the GeneHighWays database easily and freely accessible to academic researchers through a web interface. We will evaluate the new version of the GeneWays system and the GeneHighWays database for the quality of data, performance of the mathematical methods, and quality of the interface.           n/a",Computer System for Functional Analysis of Genomic Data,7148274,R01GM061372,"['Internet', 'artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biological signal transduction', 'biomedical automation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'high throughput technology', 'intermolecular interaction', 'method development', 'molecular biology information system', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2006,303688,0.010358876498887414
"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.  Furthermore, by applying coreference resolution algorithms to the text, we will improve precision and recall of knowledge extraction for populating the database n/a",Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature,7069599,R01LM006649,"['Internet', 'abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein sequence', 'publications', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,398762,0.06864087614138634
"Beyond Abstracts:  Issues in Mining Full Texts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Biomedical language processing, the application of computational techniques to human-generated texts in biomedicine, is an increasingly important enabling technology for basic and applied biomedical research. The exponential growth of the peer-reviewed literature and the breakdown of disciplinary boundaries associated with high-throughput techniques have increased the importance of automated tools for keeping scientists abreast of all of the published material relevant to their work. However, despite decades of research, the performance of state-of-the-art tools for basic language processing tasks like information extraction and document retrieval remain below the level necessary for adequate utility and widespread adoption of this technology. The development, performance and evaluation of text mining systems depend crucially on the availability of appropriate corpora: collections of representative documents that have been annotated with human judgments relevant to a language-processing task. Corpora play two roles in the development of this technology: first, they act as ""gold standards"" by which alternative automated methods can be fairly compared, and second, they provide data for the training of statistical and machine learning systems that create empirical models of patterns in language use. The conventional view is that corpora are neutral, random samples of the domain of interest. Our preliminary work suggests that the restrictions in size, quality, genre, and representational schema of the small number of existing corpora are themselves a critical limiting factor for near-term breakthroughs in biomedical text processing technology. Therefore, we propose to test the following hypothesis: Creation of large, high-quality, biomedical corpora from multiple genres will lead to significant improvements in the performance of biomedical text mining systems and the creation of new approaches to text mining tasks. Specific aims include constructing several large corpora covering a range of genres and incorporating a rich knowledge representation; identifying factors that affect differential performance on full text versus abstracts; and developing new methods for language processing, especially of full text.

"Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is for mentored training in the molecular biosciences of an established computer scientist. The training plan includes basic and advanced course work in modern biology, interactions with biological research groups, attendance at seminars and conferences, and laboratory training. Mentoring on the culture and practices of biomedical research will be provided by the sponsor. The training institution has a longstanding tradition of interdisciplinary research and specific expertise in cutting edge proteomics methods. The candidate will be fully committed to a combination of training and research. The research plan is based on the critical need to organize and summarize the knowledge in the vast biomedical literature. Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,7033080,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2006,133459,0.06869727540470871

"Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent decades, biomedical researchers are facing a new challenge that grows exponentially.

These new methods provide enormous opportunities for rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine because they allow scientists to study living beings in a global scale with greater speed. However, analyzing the data generated by these new methods can be a daunting task and often requires the development of specialized data extraction and conversion computer programs. Because only a few scientists are well trained both in life sciences and computer science, there exists a bottleneck between the great research opportunities these volume data can provide us, and the actual advances scientists can achieve from using them.   In this project, we propose to develop an auto-programming tool for biomedical scientists to help them handle the large amount of data in their research. This tool will observe the visual extraction and conversion of sample data by users via a graphical user interlace, i.e., through the point, click and drag operations familiar to most computer users. After that, it will be able to automatically generate computer programs that can carry out the same data extraction and conversion tasks for its users, on any new data. That is to say, by seeing a few examples of a user's data extraction and conversion needs, this tool can automatically turn that into computer solutions. Using this tool will be easy and will not require any sophisticated computer science training because it does the programming job for its users automatically.   This tool can have the broadest applicability in all biomedical research areas where textual format data are generated and processed with computational technologies. Therefore, this tool will provide great enabling power to biomedical scientists to help them make rapid advances in biomedical research and medicine.   n/a",Visual Data Extraction and Conversion Programming Tool,6929696,R33GM066400,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'biomedical resource', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'information retrieval']",NIGMS,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2005,206378,0.03763286282462057
"Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with information being published within their own fields, let alone biology as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are therefore becoming inadequate.      Here we propose to continue to develop our Medstract Project to apply recent advances in the computational analysis of text to organize and structure the biological literature. The Medstract project will reduce the time required for biomedical researchers to find information of interest and should facilitate the development of new research insights.  This project is the result of a unique collaboration between a computational linguistics lab at Brandeis University and a molecular biology lab at Tufts University School of Medicine. Previously we have developed an extensive set of tools for analyzing and processing biomedical text. We have used these tools to develop databases of biomedical acronyms, inhibitors, regulators, and interactors from Medline abstracts and have made these available on the web. These resources are currently used by hundreds of investigators every day. In addition we have generated and made available gold standard markup files for several biological terms and relations for use as testing standards by other groups developing knowledge extraction engines for the biomedical domain.      Here we propose to extend and enhance our current Medstract databases as well to generate new databases using the tools that we have developed. New databases will include protein modifications, domains and motifs, and tissue and cellular localization information. In addition, we will use the bio-relation databases as the foundation for constructing a system allowing point-to-point regulatory pathway identification. We will enhance the robustness of these databases by utilizing algorithms that we have developed for rerendering the semantic ontologies for the biomedical lexicon.  Furthermore, by applying coreference resolution algorithms to the text, we will improve precision and recall of knowledge extraction for populating the database n/a",Automated Knowledge Extraction for Biomedical Literature,6896406,R01LM006649,"['Internet', 'abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'informatics', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'information systems', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein sequence', 'publications', 'semantics', 'syntax', 'vocabulary development for information system']",NLM,BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,403171,0.06864087614138634
"Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Electronic medical record systems (EMR) contain a wealth of clinical data that is invaluable for biomedical research, but because there are no satisfactory methods to build coherent specialized knowledge bases, which represent the information in free text medical records, data mining and clinical discovery are held back. Medical Reporting Solutions, Inc. has developed advanced technology, which we propose to extend, refine, and test for constructing specialized semantic knowledge bases. These knowledge bases will encode the clinical information in medical reports, and enable automated natural language processing systems for extracting clinical knowledge.      Our research and development uses methods in corpus linguistics and sentential logic to represent the knowledge in free-text medical reports in an efficient, codeable manner. We have created tools to map sentences in a medical domain to unique codeable propositions. Our method for creating knowledge ontologies makes it easy for biomedical researchers to get semantic information at the appropriate level of detail. The knowledge base and mapping tables allow us to analyze medical reports in near real-time. One knowledge base, under development, is derived from hundreds of thousands of reports in the radiology domain, and we intend to analyze other medical domains using the methods we have pioneered.      Our phase one project plan includes further improving our knowledge editing tools, substantially enlarging our semantic knowledge base to cover over 60-70% of the radiology domain, and extensively test our knowledge representation schema against actual radiology reports. We plan to make the knowledge base freely accessible to the biomedical research community, while providing commercial services to codify free text reports found in EMRs. n/a",Extracting Semantic Knowledge from Clinical Data Sources,6988908,R43LM008974,"['automated medical record system', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'informatics', 'information retrieval']",NLM,"LOGICAL SEMANTICS, INC.",R43,2005,100000,0.030187275816846475
"Biomedical Ontology and Tools for Database Curation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a new tool for text data mining-a biomedical language ontology and integrated natural-language-processing methods. Our long-term goal is to provide resources for biomedical knowledge discovery from text. Our immediate goal is to provide a knowledge discovery tool for the curation of organism databases such as the Genome Database (SGD). The proposed research not only serves the research needs of the SGD community, it also helps the broader biomedical community exploit the strengths of the comparative approach to biological research. The hypothesis of this proposal is that knowledge discovery from biomedical text requires a knowledge base that integrates both genomic and linguistic information. This hypothesis is based on two observations: (a) the language of biomedicine, like all natural language, is complex in structure and morphology (the basic units of meaning) and poses problems of synonymy (several terms having the same meaning), polysemy (a term having more than one meaning), hypernymy (one term being more general than another), hyponymy (one term being more specific than another), denotation (what a term refers to in contrast to what it means), and denotation and description (different ways of referring to the same thing); and (b) important biomedical knowledge sources, such as the Gene Ontology (GO), are expressed in natural language. The specific aims of the proposed project are to: 1. Extend an existing biomedical language ontology to include genomic and linguistic data from SGD; 2. Use this ontology to discover, in full-text articles made available by SGD, information about the molecular function of yeast gene products that can be inferred from direct experimental assays; 3. Evaluate the effectiveness of the new tool and methods by comparing its results to those of the SGD curators for gene products that have GO functional annotations with evidence code IDA (Inferred from Direct Assay). n/a",Biomedical Ontology and Tools for Database Curation,6885487,R43HG003600,"['computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fungal genetics', 'information retrieval', 'information system analysis', 'molecular biology information system', 'yeasts']",NHGRI,"CONVERSPEECH, LLC",R43,2005,99250,0.06344939824561079
"Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal is for mentored training in the molecular biosciences of an established computer scientist. The training plan includes basic and advanced course work in modern biology, interactions with biological research groups, attendance at seminars and conferences, and laboratory training. Mentoring on the culture and practices of biomedical research will be provided by the sponsor. The training institution has a longstanding tradition of interdisciplinary research and specific expertise in cutting edge proteomics methods. The candidate will be fully committed to a combination of training and research. The research plan is based on the critical need to organize and summarize the knowledge in the vast biomedical literature. Curated databases are expensive to create and maintain; do not estimate confidence of assertions; and do not allow for divergence of opinions. Information extraction (IE) methods can be used to partially overcome these limitations by automatically extracting certain types of information from biomedical text.       In most genres of scientific publication, the most important results in a paper are illustrated in non-textual forms, such as images and graphs. The broad thesis underlying our proposed research is that one can provide better access to the information in online scientific publications by extracting information jointly from figure images and their accompanying captions. With the exception of certain previous work by the Murphy group, previous biomedical IE systems have not attempted to extract information from image data, only text.      This proposal addresses these issues in the specific context of fluorescence microscope images depicting the subcellular localization of proteins. This goal is consonant with a major focus of current biomedical research: the identification of expressed genes and the description of the proteins they encode. Motivated by recent large-scale projects which major focus of current biomedical research is the identification of expressed genes and the description (or annotation) of the proteins they encode, the Murphy group has developed automated systems for recognizing subcellular structures in 2D and 3D images. Automated image analysis techniques have also been applied to images harvested from online biomedical journal articles. This system will be extended to create a robust, comprehensive toolset for extracting, verifying and querying biologically relevant information from the text and images found in online journals. Based on this toolkit, a set of tools will be developed for aiding researchers to identify and locate information found in online journals. Upon completion of the proposed training, the candidate will be well placed to take a leadership position in machine learning applications to the range of experimental methods used in biomedical research.               n/a",Understanding Figures & Captions for Location Proteomics,6865478,K25DA017357,"['bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'fluorescence microscopy', 'gene expression', 'image processing', 'online computer', 'protein localization', 'proteomics', 'publications', 'training']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,K25,2005,162750,0.06869727540470871
"Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Since the introduction of the Mycin system more than 25 years ago, it has widely been hypothesized that extensive, well-represented computer knowledge-bases will facilitate a wide variety of scientific and clinical tasks. Driven by growing knowledge-management challenges arising from the proliferation of high throughput instrumentation, recently created knowledge-bases in areas related to genomics and related aspects of contemporary biology, such as the Gene Ontology, EcoCyc and PharmGKB, have begun to become integrated into the laboratory practices of a growing number of molecular biologists. However, these successful molecular biology knowledge-bases (MBKBs) have two drawbacks which impede their more general application: each has been narrowed to a particular special purpose, either in its domain of applicability or in the scope of knowledge represented, and each of these knowledge-bases was constructed largely on the basis of enormous human effort. Given the current state of molecular biology data and recent advances in database integration and information extraction technology, we proposed to test the following hypothesis: Current computational technology and existing human-curated knowledge resources are sufficient to build an extensive, high-quality computational knowledge-base of molecular biology. To test this hypothesis we propose to first create tools which can (a) automatically link incommensurate knowledge sources using semantic linking, and (b) use natural language processing techniques to extract new information from NCBrs GeneRIFs and from the GO definitions fields; and second, to evaluate the results of these methods by carefully quantifying the degree to which the induced linkages and extracted assertions are complete, consistent and correct. Although we propose to construct a broad and rich knowledge-base in order to develop and test the adequacy of largely automated methods to leverage existing human-curated collections, we do not propose to build a comprehensive MBKB.            n/a",Technology Development for a MolBio Knowledge-Base,6822280,R01LM008111,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information retrieval', 'molecular biology information system', 'technology /technique development']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2004,577307,-0.0007952169577382581

"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.                                                                                                                                                           ""Data mining"" is a recently-coined term for using computers to explore           large databases, with a goal of discovering new relationships but                usually with no specific target defined at the outset. In addition to            accuracy, simplicity, coherence, and cost, a program that purports to            discover new relationships must be able to assess novelty. We propose to         measure the extent to which proposed relationships are novel by                  comparing them against existing knowledge in the domain of discourse,            and to look for unusual rules (and other relations) that would be very           interesting if true.                                                                                                                                              The computer program we are primarily building on, RL, is a knowledge-           based learning program that learns classification rules from a                   collection of data. RL has been demonstrated to be flexible enough to            allow guidance from prior knowledge, and powerful enough to learn                publishable information for scientists working in several different              domains.

"AUTOMATED KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION FOR BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE It is becoming increasingly difficult for biologists to keep pace with           information being published within their own fields, let alone biology           as a whole. The ability to rapidly access specific and current                   biomedical information as well as to quickly gain an overview of current         knowledge in a given field is becoming more difficult while at the same          time more important. Traditional methods of keeping up with advances are         therefore becoming inadequate.                                                                                                                                    This project will involve a unique collaboration between a computational         linguist at Brandeis University and two biologists at Tufts University           School of Medicine. We propose to make use of recent advances in the             computational analysis of text to organize and summarize the biological          literature. Building on our previous language technology research at             Brandeis, we propose to integrate the domain knowledge of the National           Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with                Brandeis' semantic lexicon, CoreLex, toward the development of                   normalized structured representations of the semantic content of                 abstracts in the Medline database. These data structures, called lexical         webs, accelerate the availability of information in a richly hyperlinked         index that facilitates rapid navigation and information access.                  Automated analysis of biological abstracts will be combined with                 information derived from sequence databases to provide an up-to-date and         comprehensive database of information regarding known genes and                  proteins. The results of this analysis will be used to construct a web           accessible database organized on a gene-by-gene basis.                                                                                                            Other unique aspects of this database will be the visualization of               motifs and features extracted from Medline abstracts through the                 generation of annotated structure-function maps of proteins and genes,           and the construction of gene-specific semantic indexes to the relevant           biological literature.

"DATA MINING AND MODEL BUILDING IN MEDICAL INFORMATICS Our long-term goal is to assist biomedical scientists by extracting and          codifying new knowledge from large biomedical databases routinely by             computer. As large collections of data become more readily accessibly,           the opportunities for discovering new information increase. We propose           here to work toward this goal by extending our prior research on machine         learning in two important directions: (1) codification of disparate              pieces of knowledge into a coherent model (model building), and (2)              discovery of new information in medical databases (data mining).                                                                                                  Machine learning programs find classification rules (or decision trees           or networks) that separate members of a target class from other                  individuals. They have emphasized predictive accuracy, with some                 attention to tradeoffs between accuracy and cost of errors or between            accuracy and simplicity. We propose a framework in which these, and              other, tradeoffs are explicit and the criteria by which tradeoffs are            made are available for modification. We also include semantic                    considerations among the criteria to control the internal coherence of           models.

"COMMUNITY DEPOSIT AND REVIEW OF BIOCHEMICAL DATABASES DESCRIPTION:  Computing with biochemical reactions is increasingly important     in studying genomes, assessing toxicity, and developing therapeutics.  There     are several important information sources, but their data are rudimentary        and often inaccurate.  Incorporation of biochemical information into             databases is extremely slow compared to that of sequence and structural          information, and will lag further as large-scale surveys of gene expression      and other reactions accelerate over the next few years.

"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,9949779,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,545793,0.02265647164245495
"Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine Mining useful knowledge from the biomedical literature holds potentials for helping literature searching, automating biological data curation and many other scientific tasks. We have therefore focused on recognizing various types of biological entities in free text, such as gene/proteins, disease/conditions, and drug/chemicals, etc, and their relationships.   Manually annotated data is key to developing text-mining and information-extraction algorithms. However, human annotation requires considerable time, effort and expertise. Given the rapid growth of biomedical literature, it is paramount to build tools that facilitate speed and maintain expert quality. While existing text annotation tools may provide user-friendly interfaces to domain experts, limited support is available for figure display, project management, and multi-user team annotation. In response, we developed TeamTat (https://www.teamtat.org), a web-based annotation tool (local setup available), equipped to manage team annotation projects engagingly and efficiently. TeamTat is a novel tool for managing multi-user, multi-label document annotation, reflecting the entire production life cycle.   To facilitate research in the development of pre-training language representations in the biomedicine domain, we previously introduced the Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation (BLUE) benchmark, upon which we recently studied a multi-task learning (MTL) model, as it has achieved remarkable success in natural language processing applications. Our empirical results demonstrate that the MTL fine-tuned models outperform state-of-the-art transformer models (eg, BERT and its variants) by 2.0% and 1.3% in biomedical and clinical domains, respectively. We make the datasets, pre-trained models, and codes publicly available.   In 2019, we employed high-performance machine learning-based NER tools for concept recognition and trained our concept embeddings, BioConceptVec, via four different machine learning models on 30 million PubMed abstracts. BioConceptVec covers over 400,000 biomedical concepts mentioned in the literature and is of the largest among the publicly available biomedical concept embeddings to date.  Our own research and work from others have shown that text-mining tools have rapidly matured: although not perfect, they now frequently provide outstanding results. In a recent community article, we describe 10 straightforward writing tipsand a web tool, PubReCheckguiding authors to help address the most common cases that remain difficult for text-mining tools. We anticipate these guides will help authors work be found more readily and used more widely, ultimately increasing the impact of their work and the overall benefit to both authors and readers.   Separately, we have applied cutting-edge deep learning techniques to finding similar sentences in electric medical records, in a community task called Semantic Textual Similarity (BioCreative/OHNLP STS) challenge. The official results demonstrated our best submission was the ensemble of eight models. Our submissions achieved a Person correlation coefficient of 0.8328  the highest performance among all submission teams.   As shown above, deep learning, a class of machine learning algorithms, has showed impressive results in several of our recent studies this year. In addition to applying it to natural language processing, we have also seen its success in our medical image analysis such as processing chest X-rays, CT images, and various kinds of retinal images for autonomous disease diagonosis and prognosis.   As one of the most ubiquitous diagnostic imaging tests in medical practice, chest radiography requires timely reporting of potential findings and diagnosis of diseases in the images. Automated, fast, and reliable detection of diseases based on chest radiography is a critical step in radiology workflow. In this work, we developed and evaluated various deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for differentiating between normal and abnormal frontal chest radiographs, in order to help alert radiologists and clinicians of potential abnormal findings as a means of work list triaging and reporting prioritization. A CNN-based model achieved an AUC of 0.98240.0043 (with an accuracy of 94.640.45%, a sensitivity of 96.500.36% and a specificity of 92.860.48%) for normal versus abnormal chest radiograph classification. The remarkable performance in diagnostic accuracy observed in this study shows that deep CNNs can accurately and effectively differentiate normal and abnormal chest radiographs, thereby providing potential benefits to radiology workflow and patient care.  Another such project relates to Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries and, by 2040, will affect approximately 300 million people worldwide. Accurate AMD severity detection and progression prediction to sight-threatening late disease stage is thus of significant importance for personalizing monitoring and preventative interventions. As a joint effort between National Library of Medicine and National Eye Institute, we developed deep learning models for detecting reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) using fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images or, alternatively, color fundus photographs (CFP) in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We demonstrated that the fully automated deep learning model was superior to existing clinical standards and has the potential for improved patient care. n/a",Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction in Biomedicine,10261222,ZIALM091813,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Chemicals', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evaluation', 'Fundus', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Information Retrieval', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'National Eye Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'PubMed', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'convolutional neural network', 'data curation', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'improved', 'interest', 'language training', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-task learning', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'radiologist', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'success', 'text searching', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,1664656,0.055442335998076006
"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting).

"Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question The Repository for Informed Decision Making, Clinical Question Answering and Consumer Health Question Answering projects are addressing the above objectives by developing knowledge-based and machine learning approaches to extraction and structuring of information in biomedical literature and other types of text (such as clinical notes and registered clinical trials) for the following types of information: 1) the diseases and conditions; 2) the numbers, co-morbidities, and socio-demographic characteristics of study subjects/participants, such as species, gender, smoking status and alcohol consumption; 3) the therapeutic and diagnostic interventions; 4) the study and publication types; 5) the end-points and the outcomes of the studies; 6) drug interactions and 7) adverse drug reactions.  In FY2020, we have developed a number of new approaches to facilitate understanding information requests sent to NLM customer services and long queries submitted to MedlinePlus search engine. Information requests sent to customer services are often several paragraphs long and provide the background and context that the customers believe will help understand their needs. For example, customers often describe several generations of their families affected by a disease and ask if their children will have it. The long MedlinePlus queries consist of one or two sentences and are often formed as questions. Both of these request forms are usually ungrammatical and rife with misspellings, abbreviations and informal language. We have developed a spellchecker for consumer language that is performing adequately on the misspellings important to understanding of the needs. After correcting spelling, our system employs three modules: a knowledge-based and a supervised machine learning method to understand the main points of the request, such as the disease or a drug of interest and the type of information about it. The systems extract the main points, which we found are sufficient to automatically search MedlinePlus and find authoritative and relevant pages for 65% of the requests. The third approach is to find similar questions that already have authoritative answers, e.g., provided by NIH institutes. In FY2020, the prototype consumer health question answering system https://chiqa.nlm.nih.gov/ was used to create data collection for automatic summarization of answers find in individual documents.  Our clinical question answering system is based on the framework for asking well-formed questions developed by the evidence-based medicine experts. Their analysis showed that presenting a clinical information need as four-part question frame: patient characteristics/problem; planned intervention; comparison; and desired outcome, helps formulate search engine queries that lead to relevant results. We developed methods for automatic extraction of question frames from information requests, automatic query formulation and automatic extraction of answers from retrieval results. The LHC CQA1.0 system extracts the bottom-line advice from biomedical publications and aligns the question frames and the answers to find the best answer. The CQA 1.0 system is currently used to provide bottom-line for retrieved images in the LHC Open-i system and to provide summaries of the biomedical articles in the LHC Open Summarizer.   In FY2020, our systems were used to study how to quickly address information needs of professionals, policymakers and the public. We organized two community-wide evaluations, for which our systems served as baselines. One evaluation,  TREC-COVID focuses on finding documents containing answers about Covid-19, and the second evaluation takes it further to answer questions asked by various stakeholders. n/a",Natural language processing for precision medicine and clinical and consumer health question,10269687,ZIALM010009,"['Abbreviations', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'COVID-19', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'MedlinePlus', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publications', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Review Literature', 'Role', 'Services', 'Smoking Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'repository', 'search engine', 'sociodemographics', 'spelling', 'study characteristics', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,799199,0.03929469848118271
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10052028,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2020,358691,0.041128286434248484
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10057158,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'structured data', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2020,795873,0.03509175563039909
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution. Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data.",Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science,9955351,R01LM008111,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Hybrids', 'Information Distribution', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical ontology', 'cohort', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'design and construction', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'light weight', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'online resource', 'ontology development', 'rare genetic disorder', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,517554,0.013775878293942357

"Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP Project Summary  Natural language processing (NLP) technology is now widespread (e.g. Google Translate) and has several important applications in biomedical research. We propose a new target for NLP: extraction of scientific questions stated in publications. A system that automatically captures and organizes scientific questions from across the biomedical literature could have a wide range of significant impacts, as attested to in our diverse collection of support letters from researchers, journal editors, educators and scientific foundations. Prior work focused on making binary (or probabilistic) assessments of whether a text is hedged or uncertain, with the goal of downgrading such statements in information extraction tasks—not computationally capturing what the uncertainty is about. In contrast, we propose an ambitious plan to identify, represent, integrate and reason about the content of scientific questions, and to demonstrate how this approach can be used to address two important new use cases in biomedical research: contextualizing experimental results and enhancing literature awareness. Contextualizing results is the task of linking elements of genome-scale results to open questions across all of biomedical research. Literature awareness is the ability to understand important characteristics of large, dynamic collections of research publications as a whole. We propose to produce rich computational representations of the dynamic evolution of research questions, and to prototype textual and visual interfaces to help students and researchers explore and develop a detailed understanding of key open scientific questions in any area of biomedical research. Project Narrative The scientific literature is full of statements of important unsolved questions. By using artificial intelligence systems to identify and categorize these questions, the proposed work would help other researchers discover when their findings might address an important question in another scientific area. This work would also make it easier for students, journal editors, conference organizers and others understand where science is headed by tracking the evolution of scientific questions.",Scientific Questions: A New Target for Biomedical NLP,10069773,R01LM013400,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Biomedical Research', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Expert Systems', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Work', 'design', 'dynamical evolution', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'graduate student', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'journal article', 'news', 'novel', 'pharmacovigilance', 'prototype', 'symposium', 'text searching', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2020,462393,0.045078483470848425
"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents Narrative clinical reports contain a rich set of clinical knowledge that could be invaluable for clinical research. However, they may also contain personally identifiable information (PII) that make those clinical reports classified as PHI, which is associated with use restrictions and risks to privacy. Computational de-identification seeks to remove all instances of PII in such narrative text in order to produce de-identified documents, which would no longer be classified as PHI and can be used in clinical research with fewer constraints and with almost no risk to privacy. Computational de-identification uses artificial intelligence methods including pattern recognition and computational linguistic techniques to recognize words and other alphanumeric tokens denoting PII (e.g., names, addresses, and telephone and social security numbers) in the text, and replace them with labels such as NAME and ADDRESS. In this way, both patient privacy is protected and clinical knowledge is preserved.  After exploring existing de-identification tools, the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) began developing a new software application called NLM Scrubber, which is capable of de-identifying many types of clinical reports with high accuracy. The software design is based on both deterministic and probabilistic artificial intelligence methods utilizing large dictionaries of personal names, addresses, and organizations. The application accepts narrative reports in plain text or in HL7 format. When the input reports are formatted as HL7 messages, the application software leverages patient information embedded in HL7 segments to find such information in the text portion of the HL7 message.  NLM Scrubber has been downloaded by a number of organizations for testing and use, including IBM, Google, Fred Hutch Cancer Research Center, Harvard Medical School, Florida International University, University of Bristol, University College Dublin, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. National Cancer Institute (NCI) along with the state cancer registries working with NCI have also been voiced their interests in using NLM Scrubber to de-identify narrative pathology reports in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.  Our current focus is making NLM-Scrubber answer various needs of clinical scientists and clinical data managers without a deep understanding of the underlying technology. In this term, we started moving our codebase from Perl to a C++/Python-based system, which will provide us more flexibility, higher performance and scalability for future functionalities.  While NLM-Scrubber can be used for de-identifying all clinical reports repository-wide, it can also be used in various modes tailored to the user and their context, including on-demand cohort-specific de-identification and de-identification with patient and provider identifiers. NLM-Scrubber enables clinical scientists, the users of de-identified data, to be part of the process and shape the de-identification output based on their needs. n/a",NLM Scrubber: NLM's Software Application to De-identify Clinical Text Documents,10268072,ZIALM010002,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Dictionary', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Methods', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Names', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Output', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personally Identifiable Information', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Social Security Number', 'Software Design', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'base', 'cohort', 'college', 'data de-identification', 'flexibility', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'repository', 'tool']",NLM,NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE,ZIA,2020,845090,0.022724612083373737
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domainagnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10057127,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2020,609068,-0.00614008408062421
"Unifying Templates, Ontologies and Tools to Achieve Effective Annotation of Bioassay Protocols Project Summary Biological assays are the foundation for developing chemical probes and drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolutionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that scientists specify their assays through text descriptions written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized annotations readable by computers. This lack of standardized and machine-readable assay descriptions is a major impediment to manage, find, aggregate, compare, re-use, and learn from the ever-growing corpus of assays (e.g., >1.2 million in PubChem). Thus, there is a critical need for better annotation and curation tools for drug discovery assays. However, the process to go from a simple text protocol to highly detailed machine-readable semantic annotations is not trivial. Multiple tools and technologies are required: ontologies or the structured controlled vocabularies; templates that map specific vocabularies to properties that are to be captured; and software tools to actually apply these ontologies to a given text. Currently, each of these exists in isolation; yet, a bottleneck in any one tool or technology, or a gap between the different pieces, disrupts the overall process, resulting in poor or no annotation of the datasets. Here we propose a project to combine and integrate these three technologies (which are also the core competencies of the three groups collaborating on this proposal). We will deliver a novel, comprehensive, user-friendly data annotation and curation system that is highly interconnected, encompassing the full cycle, and real-world practice, of required tasks and decisions, by all parties within the `bioassay annotation ecosystem' (researchers performing curation, dedicated curators, IT specialists, ontology owners, and librarians/repositories). The alliance between academic and commercial collaborators, who already work together, will greatly benefit the project and minimize execution risk. Our specific aims are to: (1) Develop a bioassay-specific template editor and templates by adopting the Stanford (Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval, CEDAR) data model to the machine learning-based curation tool BioAssay Express, to exploit the broad functionality of its data structures, tools and interfaces; (2) Define and create an ontology update process and tool (`OntoloBridge') to support rapid feedback between curators/users and ontology experts and enable semi-automated incorporation of suggestions for updates to existing published ontologies; (3) Develop new tools to export annotated data into public repositories such as PubChem; and (4) Evaluate our solution across diverse audiences (pharma, academia, repositories). The system will improve bioassay curation efficiency, quality, and effectiveness, enabling scientists to generate standardized annotations for their experiments to make these data FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). We envision this suite of tools will encourage annotation earlier in the data lifecycle while still supporting annotation at later stages (e.g., submission to repositories or to journals). Project Narrative Biological assays are the foundation for developing drugs, but new Big Data approaches – which have revolu- tionized other areas of biomedical science – have not yet advanced this early step of biomedical research: analysis of assay data. The obstacle is that assays are written in scientific English, which need to be translated into standardized descriptions readable by computers. This lack of machine-readable annotations is a major impediment to manage, find, compare, re-use, and learn from the millions of assays.

"An Informatics Framework for Discovery and Ascertainment of Drug-Supplement Interactions Most U.S. adults (68%) take dietary supplements (DS) and there is increasing evidence of drug-supplement interactions (DSIs); our ability to readily identify interactions between DS with prescription medications is currently very limited. To optimize the safe use of DS, there remains a critical and unmet need for informatics methods to detect DSIs. Our rationale is that an innovative informatics framework to discover potential DSIs from the large scale of biomedical literature will enable a new line of research for targeted DSI validation and will also significantly narrow the range of DSIs that must be further explored. Our long-term goal is to use informatics approaches to enhance DSI clinical research and translate its findings to clinical practice ultimately via clinical decision support systems. The objective of this application is to develop an informatics framework to enable the discovery of DSIs by creating a DS terminology and mining scientific evidence from the biomedical literature. Towards these objectives, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Compile a comprehensive DS terminology using online resources; and (2) Discover potential DSIs from the biomedical literature. The successful accomplishment of this project will deliver a novel informatics paradigm and resources for identifying most clinically significant DSI signals and their biological mechanisms. This information is critical to subsequent efforts aimed at improving patient safety and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. The results from this study are imperative in order to achieve the ultimate goal of reducing an individual’s risk of potential DSIs.

"Query Log Analysis for Improving User Access to NCBI Web Services Over the last decade, the online search for biological information has progressed rapidly and has become an integral part of any scientific discovery process. Today, it is virtually impossible to conduct R&D in biomedicine without relying on the kind of Web resources developed and maintained by the NCBI. Indeed, each day millions of users search for biological information via NCBIs updated online PubMed system. However, finding data relevant to a users information need is not always easy. Improving our understanding of the growing population of Entrez users, their information needs and the way in which they meet these needs opens opportunities to improve information services and information access provided by NCBI. The unfortunate arrival of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented focused biomedical research and new opportunities to distribute the information learned.  Tools to aid searching PubMed are query suggestion, expansion, and spelling correction. Dedicated best match algorithms aid navigational queries by ignoring minor errors and aid informational searches using machine learning to combine relevant signals such as article popularity, publication date and type, and query-document relevance score. Additional valuable aids including identifying related articles and author name disambiguation.  Historically, an important part of MedLINE search has been the MeSH terms assigned to each article. These were critical when only titles were available, or there were only a few articles on a given topic. But with the growth of MEDLINE, the cost of humans assigning MeSH terms has become increasingly prohibitive.   As part of a trans-NLM initiative called NLM Labs, we investigated the value of MeSH terms assigned to each article, in contrast to the value of the MeSH vocabulary for synonymy. We measured that a MeSH term assigned to an article only leads to a click for a small percentage of total queries. When a query leads to multiple articles, an article that did not need MeSH for retrieval is more likely to be clicked by a small margin.   Because manual MeSH assignment is costly, there are projects that investigate the use of automation for increasing its efficiency. Assignments using the FullMeSH tool benefit from using the full text of an article, not just the title and abstract. Not only does it use the full text, it uses Learning-to-Rank to weight the different sections of the article in the most valuable manner. It performs several percentage points better than other state of the art methods.  TermVariants is a collection of synonyms developed via morphology and token distribution. To improve these synonyms, we used similarity of word embeddings to produce a probability of synonymy. This allows us to identify pairs of words that while typographically similar, have very different meanings. Examples include mushrooming vs. mushrooms and mineralizer vs. minerals.  When queries in PubMed return a large, incomprehensible set of documents, PDC, a probabilistic distributional clustering algorithm, can group the articles into titled subtopics. For example, the articles returned by the query suicide are grouped into topics such as assisted suicide, attempted suicide, prevention and control of suicide, and military personnel. Related phrases can further clarify the subtopic.  Our work is directly visible in the new PubMed in several ways. One is that the default Best Match sort order used by the new PubMed is based on a Learning to Rank algorithm we recently developed. While author disambiguation has been available for some time, it now also uses ORCID which is available in a growing number of articles. It can distinguish even articles that do not themselves include the ORCID. SARS-CoV-2 has been a shock to the entire world. The medical research community has responded with a flood of studies on COVID-19 covering prevention, diagnosis, treatment and other areas. LitCovid provides quick, direct access to these articles. The articles are separated by broad area and can be searched for more specific articles.  To understand this collection better, we applied NER and NLP tools, and other tools mentioned above, to provide an overview. We identified bioentities such as diseases, internal body organs, symptoms and co-morbidities. Their relationship to COVID-19 was determined via co-occurrence. We also automatically clustered articles by topic. We then recognized emerging topics and their growth.

"Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences Project Abstract The engineering of ontologies that define the entities in an application area and the relationships among them has become essential for modern work in biomedicine. Ontologies help both humans and computers to manage burgeoning numbers of data. The need to annotate, retrieve, and integrate high- throughput data sets, to process natural language, and to build systems for decision support has set many communities of investigators to work building large ontologies. The Protégé system has become an indispensable open-source resource for an enormous international community of scientists—supporting the development, maintenance, and use of ontologies and electronic knowledge bases by biomedical investigators everywhere. The number of registered Protégé users has grown from 3,500 in 2002 to more than 300,000 users as of this writing. The widespread use of ontologies in biomedicine and the availability of tools, such as Protégé, have taken the biomedical field forward to a new set of challenges that current technology has not been designed to address: Biomedical ontologies have grown in size and scope, and their creation, maintenance and quality assurance have become particularly effort-intensive and error-prone. In this proposal, we will develop new methods and tools that will significantly aid biomedical researchers in easily creating and testing biomedical ontologies throughout their lifecycle. Our plan entails four specific aims. First, we will develop methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to easily create ontologies directly from their source documents, such as spreadsheets, tab indented hierarchies, and document outlines. Second, we will provide the methods and tools to allow biomedical scientist to identify potential “hot spots” in their ontologies that might affect their quality. Third, we will implement a comprehensive, automated testing framework for ontologies that will assist biomedical researchers in performing ontology and data quality assurance throughout the development cycle. Fourth, we will continue to expand and support the thriving Protégé user community, as it grows to include new clinicians and biomedical scientists as they build the ontologies needed to support clinical care, data-driven research, and the elucidation of new discoveries. Project Narrative Protégé is a software system that helps a burgeoning user community to develop ontologies that enhance biomedical research and improve patient care. Protégé supports scientists, clinician researchers, and workers in informatics in data annotation, data integration, information retrieval, natural-language processing, electronic patient record systems, and decision-support systems. The Protégé resource provides critical semantic-technology infrastructure and expertise for biomedical research and the development of advanced clinical information systems.",Protege: A Knowledge-Engineering Environment for Advancing Biomedical Sciences,9848600,R01GM121724,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Research', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Patient Records', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Education and Outreach', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Letters', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patient Care', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biomedical ontology', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'document outlines', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'natural language', 'next generation', 'ontology development', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'software systems', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,559088,0.0854502682105535

"Computational Methods for Enhancing Privacy in Biomedical Data Sharing Project Summary Data sharing is essential to modern biomedical data science. Access to a large amount of genomic and clinical data can help us better understand human genetics and its impact on health and disease. However, the sensitive nature of biomedical information presents a key bottleneck in data sharing and collection efforts, limiting the utility of these data for science. The goal of this project is to leverage cutting-edge advances in cryptography and information theory to develop innovative computational frameworks for privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of biomedical data. We will draw upon our recent success in developing secure pipelines for collaborative biomedical analyses to address the imminent need to share sensitive data securely and at scale.  Practical adoption of existing privacy-preserving techniques in biomedicine has thus far been largely limited due to two major pitfalls, which this project overcomes with novel technical advances. First, emerging cryptographic data sharing frameworks, which promise to enable collaborative analysis pipelines that securely combine data across multiple institutions with theoretical privacy guarantees, are too costly to support complex and large-scale computations required in biomedical analyses. In this project, we will build upon recent advances in cryptography (e.g., secure distributed computation, pseudorandom correlation, zero-knowledge proofs) to significantly enhance the scalability and security of cryptographic biomedical data sharing pipelines. Second, existing approaches that locally transform data to protect sensitive information before sharing (e.g. de-identification techniques) either offer insufficient levels of protection or require excessive perturbation in order to ensure privacy. We will draw upon recent tools from information theory to develop effective local privacy protection methods that achieve superior utility-privacy tradeoffs on a range of biomedical data including genomes, transcriptomes, and medical images by directly exploiting the latent correlation structure of the data.  To promote the use of our privacy techniques, we will create production-grade software of our tools and publicly release them. We will also actively participate in international standard-setting organizations in genomics, e.g. GA4GH and ICDA, to incorporate our insights into community guidelines for biomedical privacy. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods and software tools that open the door to secure sharing and analysis of massive sets of sensitive genomic and clinical data. Our long-term goal is to broadly enable data sharing and collaboration efforts in biomedicine, thus empowering researchers to better understand the molecular basis of human health and to drive translation of new biological insights to the clinic. Project Narrative Rapidly-growing volume of biomedical datasets around the world promises to enable unprecedented insights into human health and disease.
