"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,0.03428345271664345
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9787546,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,312939,0.02697699844261614
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,9896942,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,362352,0.041635997651900486
"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,9714883,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,666637,0.0038465470347214953
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9753292,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,468156,-0.032358108945976086

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'competitive environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,0.012395285283091452
"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9701928,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'enteric infection', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'infection risk', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,183750,0.027686899822986607
"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9801992,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2019,319720,-0.0010859699992249103
"Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn Abstract Worldwide, infectious disease remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and results in one million newborn deaths each year. Rapid and precise profiling of pathogens is the key to targeted and effective clinical management of infectious disease. However, current diagnostic methods are slow, limited in breadth of detection, and often unreliable. Further, they have limited ability to detect polymicrobial infection and suffer from poor specificity due to an inability to distinguish clinically relevant from non-pathogenic DNA. Genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (HRM) provides a simple, rapid, and modern alternative to blood culture testing. HRM generates sequence specific melt curves in a closed-tube reaction as PCR-amplified DNA fragments are heated and disassociate. Our team has advanced this technology through the proof-of-concept stage, demonstrating that a novel digital PCR format for HRM can achieve accurate universal genotyping and quantification of DNA targets in under 3 hours. DNA sequences present in mixtures are individually amplified and identified using the principles of microfluidic sample partitioning and machine learning to enable sensitive specific polymicrobial detection of all the targets present in the DNA mixture. However, for clinical integration, critical innovations are needed. This includes optimization of our upstream processing steps to selectively capture, load, and detect DNA sequences from only viable pathogen cells from a small-volume (≤ 1mL) neonatal blood sample. Further, methods to establish linkages between pathogen identity and antibiotic resistance are needed at the single cell level to fully characterize and accurately quantitate the resistance profile of the pathogen population for precise targeted treatment. In phase I of this proposal, we will focus on refining sample preparation steps to (1) maximize our sensitivity and (2) enable co-localization of resistance markers with identified microbes. We hypothesize that we can efficiently capture pathogen load from blood, reducing interference from human cell contents and enable single cell analysis and quantitation of only viable pathogens while linking species identification and resistance. The processes and tests developed in this proposal will provide: 1) high negative predictive value to rule out bloodstream infection; and 2) specific identification and quantitation of pathogens along with co-localization of relevant antibiotic resistance genes for the targeted treatment of true infections while limiting influence from contaminants or environmental microbes of no clinical significance. In Phase II, the system will be developed to its beta form for testing in a clinical environment. Melio’s goal is to ultimately deliver a low-cost, small-footprint benchtop device compatible with the clinical workflow. Narrative We propose the development of a culture-independent molecular diagnostic test that will enable the rapid and precise detection of infections in newborns. This test uniquely combines the cutting-edge technologies of machine learning, microfluidic partitioning of samples for digital interrogation, and High-Resolution Melting of nucleic acids to create unique pathogen fingerprints for all high-risk bacterial, fungal, and viral pathogens and associated resistance marker(s) present in small-volume blood samples in under 3 hours. Such a timely and accurate test is needed for effective antimicrobial therapy in newborns suspected of infection to reduce antibiotic use in non-infected patients while aggressively treating those in need with narrow spectrum antibiotics targeted towards the offending pathogens.",Rapid and broad pathogen profiling system for infection in newborn,9778646,R43AI145567,"['Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Asses', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Custom', 'Cytolysis', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA amplification', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug resistance', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidics', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory distress', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'microbiome research', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'pathogenic virus', 'plasmid DNA', 'premature', 'prevent', 'resistance mechanism', 'single cell analysis', 'targeted treatment', 'whole genome']",NIAID,MELIOLABS INC.,R43,2019,299734,0.0016282260365578839
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9646957,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,99998,-0.05633338957137119
"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9798459,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'differentiated B cell', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2019,472500,-0.03145030552568256
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation. This will help us better understand its impact on gene expression and disease.",Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data,9745659,R01HG003008,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrostatics', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HOX protein', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Groove', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Names', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'family structure', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'high throughput technology', 'innovation', 'methyl group', 'methylome', 'novel', 'preference', 'promoter', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2019,560259,-0.015426637533395753
"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9638561,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2019,364865,0.00018425937003999798
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9640679,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,322937,-0.030678800047218534
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options

systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate

workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of

dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,-0.027234378581361733
"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,9760507,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2019,65304,-0.008354907783555524
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9627995,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,393339,-0.008346369554754901
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,-0.006222018206019256
"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations.

"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9651956,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2019,219161,0.030317472506809027
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9740714,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,312660,-0.033614482510113286
"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9752227,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,30926,0.061329752678658304
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9518889,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9608712,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intrauterine infection', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2019,191250,-0.00649474302793586
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9653955,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,587448,0.0035821417040016383
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood.

"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9816677,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Diabetic wound', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Healing', 'Wound Infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,542166,0.010179080854406825
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9737246,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Stem cells', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2019,336177,-0.0012744063444580106
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9675217,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2019,452545,0.015045379876251184
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9743790,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,653159,0.019247856567143447
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,-0.02929375439255457
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,9670445,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,425122,-0.018930248043488963
"Impact of Maternal Diet and Supplements on Breast Milk Composition Breast-feeding is recommended to prevent the development of allergic diseases, but mechanisms are unclear. Human milk is a source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and fatty acids (FAs), which are likely impacted by maternal diet. HMOs are complex glycans prevalent in human milk; non-digestible by humans, but one of the main substrates for the infant gut microbiota. We have recently shown that mothers' milk has significant variations in qualitative and quantitative HMO composition, depending on genetics and maternal probiotic supplementation. Human milk is a rich source of FAs such as polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); these are strongly influenced by maternal diet and could directly induce mucosal immunity. The impact of maternal diet and supplements on immunomodulatory composition of human milk is poorly characterized and varies between mothers.  Our initial studies have shown that certain HMOs are associated with protection against cow's milk allergy in the infant, but the mechanisms are not known. Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population. OOM mothers also have rich sources of diet-based probiotics such as unpasteurized dairy products (kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter); these can significantly affect their breast milk FA and HMO composition, whereas OTC supplement use may not be common. Our central hypothesis is that factors related to OOM diet decrease the risk of allergies through impact on human milk composition. Our preliminary data suggests that the infant gut microbiome is enriched in Bifidobacteria in the OOM. Bifidobacteria in turn are largely impacted by human milk composition.  The overall objective of this supplemental application is to expand our ongoing longitudinal infant cohort study, entitled “Mucosal and systemic immunity and food allergy” (U01 AI131344), by gathering and analyzing samples to define the role of maternal diet, including dietary and OTC probiotics on human milk composition, and to assess their impact on infant immunity. The parent study is characterizing the infant gut microbiome, immune markers and atopic diseases in the first year of life in OOM and Rochester infants. We have a unique opportunity to investigate maternal dietary impact on human milk composition. This additional data along with modeling as part of the parent grant will provide holistic understanding of interactions between OOM lifestyle and infant gut microbiome composition, immune markers and allergic disease outcomes in infants. 1 Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population.

"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,9870331,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2019,123096,-0.003493801162814499
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,9640012,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'multiple omics', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,327382,0.02697699844261614
"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9458167,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2018,21727,0.06430051169518715
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults.

"Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths Project Summary / Abstract This project will identify the molecular mechanisms through which the gut microbiome interacts with infectious intestinal helminths. Intestinal helminthic parasites present one of the most pressing global health problems due to the abundance of infection, a limited understanding of etiology, and increasing drug resistance. Prior work has established that the gut microbiome can influence infection, but the specific mechanisms through which it does so are unknown. We hypothesize that the gut microbiome produces anti-helminthic metabolites that can prevent and control infection. We propose a series of experiments that integrate multi'omics data and machine learning techniques to discover natural products of the gut microbiome that predict infectious burden or associate with infection control. Our studies leverage a high-throughput zebrafish model of infection to precisely resolve these factors. Additionally, we will develop bioinformatic methods that (1) connect natural products to the genetic pathways and microbiota that produce them, and (2) impute the presence of these natural products in the human gut. Consequently, this project will produce novel anti-helminthic drug leads that can be efficiently isolated and tested, and will clarify the role of gut microbiome natural products in the etiology of infection. Project Narrative Intestinal helminthic infections are a pressing global health problem due to the number of infected individuals, a limited understanding of disease mechanisms, and an increase in resistance to anti-helminthic drugs. This project will discover gut microbiota, their genes, and their metabolites that are linked to the prevention and control of parasitic infection. The long-term goals of this project are to determine if the gut microbiome is a factor in the etiology of helminthic intestinal infection, and to identify microbiome-sourced candidates for the discovery of novel anti-helminthic drugs. !",Interactions between Gut Microbiome Natural Products and Intestinal Helminths,9436228,R21AI135641,"['Animals', 'Anthelmintics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Helminths', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Intestinal parasite', 'Intestines', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Products', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Series', 'Source', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'helminth infection', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'novel', 'prevent']",NIAID,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,220500,0.027686899822986607

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9531422,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,468098,0.012395285283091452
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9433637,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2018,73814,-0.011129918772068592
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9420621,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'human microbiota', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2018,374683,0.00018425937003999798
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9521585,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,193265,-0.012895921863335373
"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Overall Project Summary: This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter pneumonia. Both of these CDC- designated serious hazard level pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host responses to infection. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. The Technology Core will perform cell sorting of NBBAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, and perform parallel studies in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use innovative modeling approaches including a model of the alveolus during pneumonia as an ecosystem out of balance combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. The Administrative Core will perform the outward-facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,-0.027234378581361733
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9435146,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,393339,-0.008346369554754901
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,-0.006222018206019256
"Joint Analysis of Microbiome and Other Genomic Data Types PROJECT SUMMARY In the same way that the human genome project created invaluable genomic maps, the objective of this project is to develop methods for eventual construction of comprehensive genetic and metabolomic by microbome relationship maps. Such maps would be an invaluable resource for improving our understanding as to the underlying mechanisms by which microbes and –omics features influence human diseases and conditions, potentially leading to identification of novel therapeutic targets. To these ends, this proposal seeks to develop statistical and computational tools for mapping associations and interactions between microbes and other – omic features and for further utilizing other –omics to improve microbiome based prediction models. Specifically, motivated by studies examining the role of the vaginal microbiome and other –omics in birth outcomes and menopause, we aim to develop statistical methodology for (1) mapping genetic variants that influence microbiome composition so as to understand the innate component of the microbiome as well as learn mechanisms by which genetics influence outcomes; (2) creating global metabolic maps integrating both microbes and metabolites which will enable understanding of how perturbations might influence the system and identify key pathways for therapeutic target; (3) exploiting other –omics in constructing more accurate microbiome based prediction models for preterm birth; (4) developing, distributing and supporting software packages for the proposed methods. The methods are based on frameworks in which we have considerable experience, but novel technical contributions are made to accommodate features of the data such as population stratification and relatedness in genetics, phylogenetic structure, and compositionality, as well as practical considerations such as availability of samples and other –omics data. Consequently, these new methods have the potential for accelerating mechanistic and translational microbiome studies, developing vital resources for enabling systematic achievement of many biological, clinical, and public health problems that have eluded researchers for decades. PROJECT NARRATIVE The methods developed in this proposal will enable improved understanding of the interactions between microbes and other –omics, thus aiding in elucidation of the mechanisms by which microbes and –omic features influence health outcomes and aiding in identification of potential molecular targets.

"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9530534,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,198750,-0.004003305654786778
"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined.

"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes. The proposed training activities are designed to enhance the applicant's knowledge of epigenetics and physiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to further his career as an independent investigator in the area of computational epigenetics for CVD.",Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data,9392931,K01HL124050,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'high dimensionality', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2018,137512,0.011694501053161622
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9567985,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,142621,-0.025277301820481275
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9518337,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2018,537909,0.0035821417040016383
"Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface ABSTRACT Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV), first linked with an increased incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, is now associated with a spectrum of fetal and postnatal malformations and developmental disorders. Our previous studies with rhesus macaques have demonstrated that, like the human population, severe fetal outcomes are uncommon, but they have also revealed that vertical transmission of ZIKV to the fetus may more common than is currently appreciated, with 100% transmission to fetuses when dams were inoculated in the first or third trimester. Additional neurological deficits from intrauterine infection are now becoming revealed in postnatal life, thus a better understanding of the correlates of vertical transmission at the maternal-fetal interface is critical. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin-Madison are funded to conduct a study to define the viral persistence and distribution in maternal tissues of pregnant rhesus macaques at staged intervals following infection with ZIKV. That study specifically will evaluate maternal tissues, but does not support concurrent evaluation of the maternal-fetal interface. We hypothesize that the antiviral response in the decidua and placenta can determine the risk for vertical transmission of the virus and the degree of fetal pathology and developmental dysregulation. To address this hypothesis, we propose to comprehensively define the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface in these pregnancies in two Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To define the T cell, antigen-presenting cell, and innate lymphoid/natural killer cell populations in control and ZIKV-infected decidua, establishing their transcriptional, secreted, and cell-surface profiles with high-dimensional flow cytometry and dimension reduction methodologies. Specific Aim 2. To define the Hofbauer cell surface, secreted, and activation profiles in control and ZIKV- infected placentas. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometric analytical methods established in our laboratories for human decidual leukocytes, guided by our previous work with rhesus decidual leukocytes and placental Hofbauer cells, comparing infected pregnancies with control pregnancies to be supported by this R21 proposal. The ZIKV- infected decidual and placental immunome will be interpreted in light of the distribution, burden, and pathogenic impact of ZIKV replication in the decidua and the fetus. A clearer understanding of the decidual and placental immune response with ZIKV infection, which we can couple with determination of fetal infection and pathology to be gained from the current study, will allow insight into the correlates of decidual and placental immune responses of fetal outcomes. Project Narrative: Infection of pregnant women with Zika virus has been implicated in an increase in the incidence of microcephaly in Brazil, as well as other fetal pathologies of the developing nervous system. It is not understood whether the immune response of the maternal reproductive tract or the fetal placenta itself can mitigate against the risk for fetal developmental outcomes. The nonhuman primate offers an outstanding opportunity to determine if a local response against Zika infection at the maternal-fetal interface can provide insight into developing interventions to interrupt these devastating fetal outcomes once maternal infection has occurred.",Immune response to Zika infection at the primate maternal-fetal interface,9444928,R21AI136014,"['Address', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antiviral Response', 'Autopsy', 'Brazil', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Membranes', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lymphoid', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Methodology', 'Microcephaly', 'Modeling', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Optic Nerve', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Risk', 'Specimen', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Vertical Disease Transmission', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viremia', 'Virus Replication', 'Visual system structure', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'ZIKV infection', 'Zika Virus', 'analytical method', 'base', 'co-infection', 'density', 'developmental disease', 'fetal', 'fetal infection', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'malformation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'pregnant', 'reproductive tract', 'response', 'segregation', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'viral transmission', 'virtual', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,229500,-0.00649474302793586
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed.

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,-0.02929375439255457
"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9463650,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2018,460833,0.015045379876251184
"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9240483,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2017,39597,0.06430051169518715
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9382313,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'learning network', 'men', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2017,471007,-0.032358108945976086
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community.

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9353854,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,438098,0.012395285283091452
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9410769,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2017,71064,-0.011129918772068592
"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks Project Summary One of the burning questions in the study of the human microbiome is whether and how it is possible to design specific strategies for rebalancing the taxonomic and functional properties of human-associated microbial communities, triggering the transition from “disease states” to “healthy states”. While empirical studies provide strong support for the idea that we may be able to cure, or at least  treat, a number of diseases by simply transplanting microbiomes, or inducing changes through taxonomic or environmental perturbations, to date little mechanistic understanding exists on how microbial communities work, and on how to extend microbiome research from an empirical science to a systematic, quantitative field of biomedicine. We propose here to establish a computational platform--   a database (Aim 1) with fully integrated analytical software (Aims 2 and 3) --- developed for and with the cooperation of the scientific community. The resource goes beyond cataloguing microbial abundances under different condition; its aim is to enable an understanding of networks of interacting species and their condition-dependence, with the goal of eventually facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis, and designing therapeutic strategies for microbiome intervention. Our project is centered around three key aims: 1.	The creation of a Microbial Interaction Network Database (MIND), a public resource that will collect data on inter-species interactions from metagenomic sequencing projects, computer simulations and direct experiments. This database will be accessed through a web-based platform complemented with tools for microbial interaction network analysis and visualization, akin to highly fruitful tools previously developed for the study of genetic networks; the database will also serve as the public repository of microbial networks associated with human diseases; 2.	The implementation of an integrated tool for simulation of interspecies interactions under different environments, based on genomic data and whole-cell models of metabolism; 3.	The implementation of new algorithms for microbial community analysis and engineering. These algorithms, including stoichiometric, machine-learning and statistical approaches will facilitate a “synthetic ecology” approach to help design strategies (e.g. microbial transplants or probiotic mixtures) for preventing and targeting microbiome-associated diseases. Our work will fill a major gap in current microbiome research, creating the first platform for global microbial interaction data integration, mining and computation. Project Narrative Among the major developments of the genomic revolution has been the ability to identify thousands of microbial species and strains living in communities in 5 major habitats in the human body, and the recognition that the relative abundances of these populations is strongly correlated with environment: disease state, diet, treatment protocol and so on. A major challenge in utilizing the deluge of health relevant data is structuring it into a database that facilitates understanding inter-microbial interactions in these communities. The aim of this proposal is to create a database and integrated computational platform, open to and contributed to by the research community, which will greatly accelerate the conversion of data into health related actionable knowledge.","A platform for mining, visualization and design of microbial interaction networks",9221662,R01GM121950,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Empirical Research', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'base', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota transplantation', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2017,377226,0.00018425937003999798
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,9355203,K99GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'Symbiosis', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'killings', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbiota', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2017,87929,0.016021383456995962
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9317775,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,220064,-0.012895921863335373
"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9345356,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylase', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'desensitization', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,38039,-0.009961689957856342
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,-0.00269940897153585
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,-0.027234378581361733
"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.

"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9237919,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2017,410714,-0.008346369554754901
"Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection Statement of Work There is an urgent need for improved diagnostic tests for the evaluation of the etiology of febrile states, particularly in immunocompromised hosts. This project will develop host-based biomarker signatures capable of identifying the presence and pathogen class of infections in vulnerable immunocompromised human subjects, thus potentially allowing for earlier, more directed (and thus more effective) therapy as well as reducing the need for potentially harmful empiric anti-infective therapy. In this study we will a) perform high dimensional gene expression analysis on existing samples of at-risk hosts with proven candidemia, viral infection, bacterial infection, or noninfectious illness, b) develop peripheral blood-based gene expression signatures of candidemia and c) generate a combined multinomial classifier capable of differentiating four clinical states: viral infection, bacterial infection, fungal infection (candidemia) and noninfectious illness. The enclosed work offers a true paradigm shift in the way febrile illnesses in this high-risk population are diagnosed and managed. Relevance Statement Timely and accurate differentiation of viral, bacterial, and fungal illness has important implications for both the individual patient and society as earlier/more accurate diagnosis may improve patient treatment and clinical outcomes as well as curb anti-microbial overusage and subsequent proliferation of resistant organisms.","Host-derived biomarker signatures to differentiate acute viral, bacterial, and fungal infection",9373089,R21AI132978,"['Acute', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Candida', 'Candidiasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fever', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Infectious Agent', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modality', 'Mycoses', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Resistance', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adjudicate', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'candidemia', 'cohort', 'evaluation/testing', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk population', 'human subject', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'migration', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'peripheral blood', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,198750,-0.004003305654786778
"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9355704,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant formula', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Premature Infant', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2017,1679656,0.00045249498983717485
"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9248094,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lipid metabolism', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9263991,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,343125,0.042404504533212706
"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9285277,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'injured', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R01,2017,327738,-0.025277301820481275
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.

"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9323657,U01AI131344,"['Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2017,490338,0.015045379876251184
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV.

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,9038173,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'clinical biomarkers', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'pre-doctoral', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2016,39129,0.06430051169518715
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,0.012395285283091452
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood Several million units of donor platelets are transfused annually in the US and Europe to treat patients undergoing radiation treatment, chemotherapy, or organ transplant surgery. Although transfusions of donor- derived platelets are an effective way to treat thrombocytopenic patients, numerous concerns have been raised due to the increase in demand, the five-day shelf-life, and the possibilities for contamination. Platelets are produced by megakaryocytes (MKs) in the bone marrow and are derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). The long-term objective of this proposal is to generate platelets ex vivo from HSPC- enriched umbilical cord blood that will allow us to address a vast public need. Recent studies have shown that the addition of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) can greatly affect expansion of progenitor cells, but can reduce MK differentiation efficiency. My central hypothesis is that epigenetic and transcriptional changes prime or desensitize HSPC to MK differentiation cues. To investigate the role of epigenetic signals during HSPC-to- MK transition, I propose to perform high-throughput ChIP and RNA-sequencing to discover differentially active regulatory elements between expanded (low potential) and fresh cord blood HSPCs. This highly interdisciplinary and collaborative proposal utilizes computational biology and machine-learning to identify differentially active regulatory elements, and associate genetic features with MK fate. To validate my findings and establish a causal relationship between histone modifications of certain regions and MK potential, I will generate a dCas9-fusion protein that can directly manipulate the epigenetic marker at a targeted site. My findings will establish the mechanism of action of chromatin-modifying agents such as HDACi, and the causal relationship between the epigenome and MK differentiation. My highly collaborative proposal with the Miller, Bagheri, and Mahmud lab will substantially enhance our understanding of hematopoietic differentiation toward manufacturing platelets. Project Narrative More than two million platelet units from donors are used to treat patients undergoing surgery or chemotherapy every year, but short shelf-life, increasing demand, and risk of contamination keep platelets in strained supply. In my proposed study, I will apply a panel of small molecules to expand and differentiate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood into platelet-producing cells. My work will identify the role of epigenetic modifications during the culture process, and elucidate new strategies to efficiently manufacture platelets from culture.",Integrative Epigenetic Analysis and Ex Vivo Generation of Megakaryocytes from Umbilical Cord Blood,9195237,F31HL134331,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Azacitidine', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Bone Marrow', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Computational Biology', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deacetylation', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Europe', 'GATA1 gene', 'GATA2 transcription factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Growth', 'HDAC3 gene', 'HDAC6 gene', 'Hematopoietic', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Histones', 'Influentials', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Megakaryocytes', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Microtubules', 'Modification', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Somatic Cell', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Stem cells', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Tryptophan', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Valproic Acid', 'Work', 'alpha Tubulin', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'forest', 'high throughput screening', 'histone acetyltransferase', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large scale production', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'prognostic', 'sarcoma', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,37571,-0.009961689957856342
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8991063,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2016,237102,0.033308732428435836
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,-0.00269940897153585
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,-0.027234378581361733
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9262661,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Encephalitis', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Premature Infant', 'Qualifying', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2016,1661003,0.00045249498983717485
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,9267858,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R21,2016,227250,0.03722562115909498
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,9058561,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome browser', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,343125,0.042404504533212706
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis.

Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.        ",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9108539,U01AI124275,"['Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Klebsiella pneumonia bacterium', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antimicrobial drug', 'commensal microbes', 'computer studies', 'design', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'immune activation', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'physical symptom', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'research study', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2016,1722908,0.014867150192075452
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control.

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,9020203,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Extended-spectrum β-lactamase', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'gut microbiome', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,181875,0.0062882618811848385

"Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the project is to characterize the potential role of DNA methylation patterns in Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) disease etiology and mechanism. A growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic changes, in particular, altered patterns of DNA methylation, contribute to the development of autoimmune disease and can mediate genetic risk factors. To date, aberrant DNA methylation has been associated with several human autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. My proposal focuses on the identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, focusing primarily on T cells, B cells, and salivary gland tissue, a primary site of the inflammatory disease. An understanding of these profiles in the context of genetic background, publicly available genomic data (RNA, ChIP-seq, WGBS) and annotation data (TF binding motifs, genomic QTLs), and cell types have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, particularly given the well-established heterogeneity in clinical manifestations. Further, these DNA methylation profiles could become useful clinical biomarkers for determining risk and prognosis in SS, especially if their biological relevance can be validated in future functional studies. The overall hypothesis of this project is that DNA methylation changes in key genomic regions are associated with SS status and phenotype. The project will use genome-wide SNP data, epigenome-wide methylation array data, and clinical characteristics abstracted from 100 SS cases and 20 controls to address 3 related hypotheses: First, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in T cells, B cells (both derived from peripheral blood), and salivary gland biopsy tissue are associated with primary SS status after correcting for cell-type heterogeneity. Case-control differences will be tested using supervised machine learning algorithms, new region-discovery methods, and cell-mixture inference techniques. Publicly available data (listed above) will be used to infer biological relevance. Second, that epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in these samples are representative of SS sub-phenotypes. Cases (and initially controls) will be clustered using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to all relevant DNA methylation probes and subsets of probes measuring CpGs implicated in specific pathways relevant to SS. The reduced representations will be tested for association with specific clinical and serological profiles. Third, that risk alleles identifie by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are directly or indirectly associated with SS-specific DNA methylation patterns. Allelic dosage and random forest selection frequency (RFSF) analyses will be used to identify novel methylation quantitative trait loci within SS-associated genes in cases and controls (separately), and we will test whether cell-proportion or eQTLs can explain SS-specific methylation patterns.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic, highly heterogenous, multisystem autoimmune disease predominantly affecting women. This disease is known to be associated with epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, an axis of epigenetic variation that has been implicated as a mediator of disease risk in other autoimmune diseases. Full characterization of DNA methylation patterns across different cell types and affected tissues will provide new insights into disease etiology, phenotype classification, and targets for future therapeutic strategies.                ",Signals of Epigenetic Modification in Sjogrens Syndrome,8910299,F31DE025176,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Fellowship', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Sampling', 'Serological', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Activators', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bead chip', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin remodeling', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'dosage', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'forest', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2015,38673,0.06430051169518715
"Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High throughput whole genome platforms to quantitatively and efficiently assay human DNA methylation provide an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). Epigenetic modifications, such as methylation of the 5' carbon of cytosine which occurs in the context of CpG dinucleotides, do not affect the genetic sequence; however, they do play a critical role in transcriptional regulation of a gene and subsequent gene expression. We have applied this technology, in conjunction with whole genome SNP genotyping to a clinically well-characterized collection of SS cases and controls developed specifically for genetic and epigenetic studies. Samples from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) repository (total n=3,500 individuals) will b utilized, given the careful phenotype characterization and standardized collection of biospecimens that has been performed for each participant. For this proposal, we have initially obtained DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sorted cell populations with high purity, including CD14+ monocytes, CD19+ B cells, CD4+ T cells, as well as labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from 120 SICCA participants (100 SS cases and 20 controls). Data collected for ~450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome will provide a comprehensive assessment of DNA methylation for each individual for our proposed study Aims. As part of Aim 1, DNA methylation profiles will be examined using three main approaches: 1) Global DNA methylation profiles will be analyzed for association with SS risk in all sample types; 2) Multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS) and principal components analysis (PCA) will be performed to determine whether SS case samples can be distinguished from control samples; and 3) Local analyses will also be performed and will focus specifically on DNA methylation changes within candidate SS genes and genes demonstrating at least 1.5 fold methylation differences between cases and controls. Our proposal will take advantage of available whole genome data for each study participant and results from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in SS. In Aim 2, we will utilize DNA methylation profiles and methods from Aim 1 to determine whether important SS case phenotypes can be distinguished from one another. We will identify top ranked CpG sites that are either hypo or hyper methylated in specific SS case groups or that distinguish cases from controls using supervised machine learning algorithms. We will attempt replication for all top findings in an independent dataset, followed by random effects meta-analysis to incorporate other SS risk factors. Finally, we will determine whether DNA methylation profiles of interest from Aims 1 and 2 can be detected in DNA from whole blood for potential use as a biomarker. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of different cell and tissue types and genetic background have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE New molecular genetic assays offer an extraordinary opportunity to accelerate progress in the identification of epigenetic mechanisms for complex human autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren's Syndrome (SS). We propose to perform a comprehensive screen of more than 450,000 highly informative CpG sites spanning 22,000 genes across the genome using DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), sorted cell populations, and labial salivary gland biopsy tissue from SS cases and control individuals to identify epigenetic profiles that are predictive of disease risk and specifi clinical phenotypes. The identification of unique epigenetic profiles in SS, and an understanding of these profiles in the context of several different cell and tissue types and whole genome SNP data have the potential to significantly transform our understanding of SS etiology, and may lead to more effective approaches to prevention, diagnosis and treatment.                ",Genetic and epigenetic contributions to Sjogren's syndrome,8829521,R03DE024316,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Budgets', 'CD14 gene', 'CD19 gene', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Carbon', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Country', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention approach', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Production', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Study Subject', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human DNA', 'interest', 'member', 'monocyte', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'systemic autoimmune disease']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2015,236912,0.033308732428435836
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,-0.00269940897153585
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.

"Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This computational research project will analyze gastrointestinal microbiome, host cellular immune response, and host transcriptional response datasets derived from a large-scale rhesus macaque AIDS vaccine study. The vaccine study includes 70 animals divided into five groups and is designed to test the efficacy of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector expressing the major simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) proteins. In previous studies, RhCMV/SIV vaccines elicit a robust effector-memory T cell response. After challenge with highly pathogenic SIVmac239, approximately 50% of RhCMV/SIV-vaccinated monkeys exhibit a pattern of viral control that is characterized by a ""blip"" of viremia followed by control of plasma viremia to undetectable levels. One to three years later, RhCMV/SIV-protected monkeys show no sign of SIV infection, suggesting immune-mediated clearance of the virus. The mechanisms responsible for this 50% efficacy are not clear, but may reflect T cell responses at the site of SIV entry or sites of early replication. Thi project will investigate the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome on RhCMV/SIV-induced effector-memory T cell responses and protection against SIVmac239 challenge. The project includes two computationally based Specific Aims: 1) Define the composition of the gut microbiome prior to and after vaccination and during repeated limiting-dose SIVmac239 challenge; and 2) Determine how the composition of the gut microbiome correlates with protective immune cell responses and vaccine-induced host transcriptional responses. In Aim 1, 16S ribosomal sequence data (obtained from rectal swabs) will be used to determine operational taxonomic units. Variation in bacterial species over time and within individual animals will be determined using Mothur and Qiime metagenomic software.  Nonparametric statistical analyses and co-occurrence and co-exclusion networks will be used to identify bacterial species associated with progression or control of SIV infection after repeated limiting-dose intrarectal SIVmac239 challenge. In Aim 2, principle component analysis will be used to identify associations between microbiome composition and SIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Gene module-based and correlation network-based approaches will be used to determine associations between microbiome composition and host transcriptional responses (collected from whole blood samples). Together, these analyses will allow us to better understand microbiome-host interactions and their role in eliciting a protective vaccine-derived effector-memory T cell response. Such understanding will inform future vaccination strategies and attempts to modulate microbiome composition to affect vaccine efficacy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The types and numbers of bacterial species that live in the gastrointestinal tract (together known as the microbiome) affect many aspects of human health and disease, including how individuals respond to vaccination and viral infection. In this study, we will define the gastrointestinal microbiome of rhesus monkeys before and after vaccination with an experimental AIDS vaccine and after infection with a monkey immunodeficiency virus. This study will allow us to determine how the microbiome impacts the effectiveness of the vaccine and may suggest whether altering the microbiome may improve vaccine performance.            ",Impact of Gastrointestinal Microbiome on the Host Response to an Effector-Memory T-Cell AIDS Vaccine and Multiple Low-Dose Challenge,8992226,R21AI120713,"['AIDS Vaccines', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Location', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monkeys', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Network-based', 'Oregon', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'SIV', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Swab', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Research', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Washington', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'functional genomics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'microbiome', 'nonhuman primate', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'rectal', 'response', 'vaccination strategy', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'vector']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2015,217500,0.03722562115909498
"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8899611,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'differential expression', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,343125,0.042404504533212706
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis. Immune factors that closely ""track"" day-to-day changes in fatigue severity are likely involved in the disorder and are excellent targets for treatment.",Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8815258,R01AI107655,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Bed rest', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Screening', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Handheld Computers', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Leptin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'United States', 'Woman', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'men', 'novel strategies', 'resistin', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2015,435803,0.0070007255923994925
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD. There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A virulent subclone of E. coli sequence type 131 (ST131), called ST131-H30, has become the dominant extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli lineage in the US, where it kills thousands of patients each year. Multidrug resistance is a hallmark of ST131-H30-including production of the CTX-M-15 extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-making its clinical management particularly challenging. The ability of ST131-H30 to colonize more frequently and persistently than other strains is thought to be important to its disproportional dis- ease burden. Yet, in our preliminary studies, we have observed that some people fail to become colonized with ST131-H30 despite prolonged household exposure. This strongly suggests that factors other than ST131- H30's intrinsic traits influence colonization. We know that, in the human GI tract, ST131-H30 does not live alone, but rather, as a minor component of a complex microbial community, within which it may be subjected to intense inter- and intra-species competition. In our previous microbiome studies of other body sites, we observed predictable relationships between commensal bacteria and opportunistic pathogens. This led us to hypothesize that distinct components of the GI microbiota, including bacteriocin-producing E. coli strains, may competitively exclude ST131-H30. Approach: By leveraging an ongoing longitudinal study of 600 participants, who will contribute > 7,000 fecal specimens, we will conduct two case-control studies to identify the microbiota unique to individuals who remain free of ST131-H30 for 12 months despite ongoing household exposure to ST131-H30 (elite non-colonizers), as compared to individuals with persistent colonization by ST131-H30 for 12 months (elite colonizers) and individuals who newly acquire ST131-H30 during the study (acquirers). We will identify bacterial species most predictive of resistance to ST131-H30 GI colonization using indicator species and decision tree analysis. The decision model will be validated using fecal microbiota data from an additional 300 participants from another cross-sectional survey. To explore intra-species competition, we will identify commensal E. coli strains antagonistic to ST131-H30 using in vitro inhibition assays, and will cross-validate the in vitro results by assessing the antagonistic strains' association with ST131-H30 exclusion using data from the longitudinal and cross-sectional cohorts. Innovation: Our approach is innovative in attempting to define mechanisms that influence GI colonization with ST131-H30; its focus on elite non-colonizers; its inter- and intra- species investigation of the microbiome within an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study; and its goal of identifying commensal bacteria antagonistic to a single virulent E. coli subclone. The expected outcome of this study is to identify commensal bacteria that can exclude ST131-H30 from the GI tract. With emerging resistance neutralizing the effectiveness our current antibiotic armamentarium, we must find new ways to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens. These results could lead to novel, probiotic strategies for interrupting the transmission of ST131-H30 and future multidrug-resistant colonizing pathogens.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is relevant to the NIH, NIAID, and public health because it will lay the groundwork for developing novel strategies to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant E. coli. Some of the most dangerous kinds of E. coli spread asymptomatically in the gastrointestinal tracts of people. In this study, we seek to identify non- pathogenic bacteria that can prevent a deadly new strain of antibiotic-resistant E. coli, called ST131-H30, from colonizing the human gut.            ",E. coli ST131-H30 colonization: defining community and population level antagonism in the gastrointestinal microbiome,8881522,R21AI117654,"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Adhesion', 'Biological Assay', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide', 'Cystitis', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia coli', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Household', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Resistance', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Price', 'Probiotics', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Pyelonephritis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'bacteriocin', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'cohort', 'combat', 'commensal microbes', 'fluoroquinolone resistance', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal bacteria', 'innovation', 'killings', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic Escherichia coli', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'resistant strain', 'stem', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'urinary']",NIAID,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,236125,0.0062882618811848385
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,-0.0028686929263328728
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals.

"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.

"Epigenetic Transgenerational Endocrine Disruptor Actions     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A number of environmental toxicants were shown in the previous grant period to promote the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease including the fungicide vinclozolin, pesticides, plastics (BPA and phthalates), dioxin, hydrocarbons, and DDT. The ability of environmental compounds (e.g. endocrine disruptors) to promote transgenerational disease phenotypes is anticipated to be a critical aspect of adult onset disease etiology. The transgenerational inheritance phenotype requires the heritable epigenetic alterations of the germline. The current proposal is designed to further investigate the molecular and developmental aspects of the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon and assess the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for exposure and disease. The general hypothesis tested is that ""transient fetal exposure around the period of gonadal sex determination to environmental toxicants (i.e. vinclozolin) promotes the reprogramming of the epigenome (i.e. DNA methylation) of the male germline that then transmits an imprinted-like epigenome to subsequent generations to induce the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of adult onset disease (e.g. male infertility)"". The previous grant period focused on the analysis of the epigenetic alteration in the F3 generation sperm using promoter associated differential DNA methylation regions (epimutations), as well as documented the epigenetic and transcriptome changes in the F3 generation vinclozolin lineage primordial germ cells. The molecular etiology of somatic cell changes associated with ovary and testis disease was established. The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of the germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease. The experimental approach to test the above hypothesis consists of the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine the developmental and generational aspects of the genome-wide germline epimutations. Aim 2) Determine the genomic features associated with the epimutations and potential genetic alterations involved in the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance phenomenon. Aim 3) Determine the optimal exposure parameters of the environmental induced transgenerational model and correlate epigenetic biomarkers with exposure and disease. Completion of the proposed research will determine the cascade of epigenetic events involved in germ cell development that generates the sperm epimutations that transmit the epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease phenotypes. The protection of the sperm epimutations from DNA methylation erasure is anticipated in early embryonic development. The proposed research will further elucidate the molecular and developmental aspects of environmentally induced epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease and the potential use of epigenetic biomarkers for ancestral exposure and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The current proposal further investigates the molecular and developmental aspects of germline mediated epigenetic transgenerational inheritance of disease.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Telomere Length Homeostasis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Telomere integrity is essential for cell survival and proliferation. Accordingly, dysfunctional telomeres can initiate genomic instability, cellular senescence, and organismal aging. Telomere structure is provided by binding of shelterin to telomeric DNA repeats forming a nucleoprotein complex. Similar to the human shelterin, in fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, shelterin is composed of telomeric sequence-specific double-stranded and single-stranded DNA binding proteins, Taz1 and Pot1, respectively, accompanied by their protein interaction partners, Rap1, Poz1, and Tpz1, which form a ""protein bridge"" connecting Taz1 and Pot1. Shelterin protects telomere integrity as well as regulates telomerase. With the parent grant support, we biochemically identified Tpz1 mutants that can individually but specifically disrupt its interactions with Poz1, Ccq1, or Pot1. Using these separation-of-function mutants of Tpz1, we found that the complete linkage between telomere dsDNA and ssDNA binding proteins within the shelterin complex is required for defining the telomerase-nonextendible state of telomeres. Moreover, epistasis analyses revealed that Tpz1 also participates in the activation of telomeres to the extendible state via its interaction with Ccq1. Our results suggest critical regulatory roles of Tpz1 in the telomere ON/OFF binary switch. Here, we request supplemental funds to use emerging technologies and interdisciplinary teams to further advance our mechanistic understanding of shelterin to a new level. The two aims are: (1) Identify shelterin interactomes and post-translational modifications on shelterin components using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (CXMS); (2) Reveal the functional roles of Tpz1 in coordinating shelterin components for telomerase-mediated and recombination-based telomere elongation via analyzing telomere sequences using single molecule, real-time (SMRT) next- generation sequencing technology.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative Telomeres are closely involved in stem cell differentiation and cancer cell proliferation. The results of this study will lead to new mechanistc models for telomere length regulation and chromosome end protection.

"MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in patterns of DNA methylation, a modulator of gene expression, play a key role in development and disease. There has been a flurry of development of new experimental methods to accurately map 5- methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine genome-wide. However, development of computational techniques to interpret these data has lagged behind. Current analytical methods are mostly concerned with visualization of genome-level correlations between DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks or with the identification of differentially methylated regions between samples. These tools have performed poorly when trying to link methylation and expression changes at specific loci, and they find quite weak genome-wide correlations between them. We hypothesize that such discrepancies are due to limitations of the current analysis methods, which tend to oversimplify local DNA methylation signals. We propose to develop a new suite of tools using methods from computer vision to associate spatially-similar methylation changes with corresponding changes in transcription. This approach allows us to make minimal assumptions about what these signals should look like. First, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a curve similarity metric, to cluster genes together based on their methylation signals. We then find clusters of genes with similar methylation patterns that have coordinated differential expression. We export the patterns defined by these curves for use as a classifier, enabling us to enumerate genes with associated methylation and expression changes. Our model considers the entire shape and course of the signal around the gene promoter, rather than averaging the signal across windows or modeling signals with idealized statistical distributions. We recently published how our method discovered a variety of DNA methylation patterns associated with gene silencing, and produced longer and markedly higher quality gene lists than those generated by other methods. In this proposal we build on these results to address three aims concerning DNA methylation's role in gene silencing: (1) We will build a classifier to model the methylation patterns we discover and use it to examine the role of DNA hypomethylation, which occurs primarily at alternative and retrotransposon promoters that are poorly annotated, in transcriptome regulation in breast cancer. (2) We will expand our model to address the controversial role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in gene regulation and its interplay with 5-methylcytosine in differentiated cells in the central nervous system. (3) We will develop general rules governing the methylation signatures we have identified and experimentally validate their functionality. This proposal will yield a set of experimentally validated models for how DNA methylation contributes to gene silencing as well as a set of computational tools other researchers can use to analyze the role of methylation in human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA methylation is an important regulator of gene expression. Abnormal patterns of methylation are often found in cancer and other human diseases. We will develop a set of computational tools, inspired by methods from computer vision, to identify DNA methylation patterns associated with either gene silencing or activation from genomic data. We will elucidate and experimentally validate general rules governing these relationships. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Insights obtained through this work will improve our mechanistic understanding of DNA methylation and assist in the identification of patients who can benefit from DNA methylation targeted therapies.            ",MODELING DNA METHYLATION'S ROLE IN GENE REGULATION,8759963,R01GM108811,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retroelements', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'common rule', 'computerized tools', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,343125,0.042404504533212706
"Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a debilitating condition characterized by profound, chronic fatigue that is not alleviated by rest, as well as pain, post-exertional malaise, and impairments in memory and concentration. ME/CFS affects over one million women in the United States, causing significant distress and loss of function in affected individuals and a significant financial burden on society Because the underlying pathophysiology of ME/CFS is not well-understood, there are no effective treatments developed specifically for the condition, and many patients are unsatisfied with existing treatment options. Previous research provides a strong case for inflammatory involvement in ME/CFS, though no immune factors have been consistently predictive of fatigue across studies. Conventional cross-sectional research approaches may not be sufficiently sensitive for identifying ME/CFS biomarkers in cases of low-level or atypical inflammation. We have observed that women with ME/CFS demonstrate considerable day-to-day variability in their fatigue severity, and this variability may reflect rapid shifts in underlying disease mechanisms. By viewing the daily fatigue variability as an important signal, and collecting blood samples daily, we have identified a small set of serum cytokines that are strongly correlated with changes in ME/CFS 1fatigue. In this proposed study, we plan to confirm our preliminary findings of immune-fatigue relationships in a larger sample. We will collect blood samples for 25 consecutive days in 70 women with ME/CFS, as well as 20 healthy controls and 20 active fatigue controls (individuals with hypothyroidism). Blood samples will be analyzed for 51 different immune factors associated with inflammation. In addition, participants will submit daily reports of fatigue severity on handheld computers. By analyzing fatigue scores and cytokine concentrations longitudinally, we can identify cytokines that ""track"" day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. This approach will allow us to develop a physiological profile that distinguishes high fatigue days from low fatigue days, providing important information about ME/CFS mechanisms. In Aim 1, we will develop a physiological model that uses serum cytokine levels to accurately predict day-to-day fluctuations in fatigue severity. In Aim 2, we will define important ME/CFS subgroups based on cytokine-fatigue relationships. In Aim 3, we will develop a temporal pathway between immune factors and fatigue that identifies early drivers of fatigue. Additionally, we will develop a specimen bank of blood samples that can be made available to other interested researchers. Intensive longitudinal immune monitoring is a unique approach to understanding ME/CFS pathophysiology. Biomarkers revealed by this research will serve as tools in the development of ME/CFS diagnostic tests, and will provide excellent targets for developing improved therapies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a debilitating and poorly understood condition that affects over one million women in the United States. Our goal with this project is to identify biological targets that will allow better treatments for chronic fatigue to e developed. Our unique approach for discovering biomarkers involves monitoring fatigue and immune factor concentrations on a daily basis. Immune factors that closely ""track"" day-to-day changes in fatigue severity are likely involved in the disorder and are excellent targets for treatment.                ",Daily Immune Monitoring in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,8687349,R01AI107655,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Bed rest', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Screening', 'Blood specimen', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'Eotaxin', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Handheld Computers', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Hypothyroidism', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intercellular adhesion molecule 1', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Leptin', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaise', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transforming Growth Factor alpha', 'United States', 'Woman', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'loss of function', 'men', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'resistin', 'tool']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,269011,0.0070007255923994925
"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8500440,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2013,135645,0.018226822538160613
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8459567,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,287765,0.06476617962603837
"Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans have co-evolved with complex, dynamic microbial communities that play essential roles in nutrition, metabolism, immunity, and numerous other aspects of human physiology. Hence, maintenance and recovery of key beneficial services by the microbiota in the face of disturbance is fundamental to health. Yet, stability and resilience vary in, and between individuals, and are poorly understood. Our goal is to identify features of the human microbiome that predict microbial community stability and resilience following disturbance. We propose an innovative large-scale clinical study design that will generate the necessary compositional and functional data from the most relevant ecosystem, i.e., humans!  We will develop novel statistical and mathematical methods for data integration (sparse, non-linear multi-table methods), and test existing ecological theories and apply statistical learning strategies to allow data-driven investigation of ecological and clinical properties that determine and predict stability and/or resilience. The breadth and magnitude of this project's impact are significant: We envision tests to predict microbial community responses to disturbance, and procedures to stabilize or restore beneficial microbial interactions as needed. A predictive understanding of the stability and resilience of the gut microbiota will advance the rational practice of medicine. There are three key innovative aspects to our approach: 1) sequential perturbations of different types in a large number of human subjects sampled over time; 2) multiple compositional and functional measurements made on the same samples; and 3) novel data integration methods that incorporate all of the information. Aim 1. Profile the human microbiome before, during and after multiple forms of disturbance. One hundred subjects will each be sampled at 40 time points over a 34 week study period that encompasses two types of perturbation in each subject (dietary shift, and bowel cleansing or antibiotic). From each sample, we will determine taxonomic composition, genomic content, meta-transcriptome, and metabolomic profiles. Aim 2. Discover resilience: Develop non-linear approaches for complex data integration using sparse, multiple-table methods. We will develop a novel sparse, multiple-table approach for data integration and simultaneous analysis of diverse types of complex data over time. Aim 3. Explain resilience: Use statistical learning approaches to find the predictive features that characterize resilience. Using the multiple table approach, we will compare routine unperturbed dynamics within a community to the varied responses to a perturbation, define stable states, and identify common network features characteristic of resilient communities subjected to different forms of disturbance. Finally, we wil use validation techniques to confirm these candidate predictors of community resilience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Humans rely on the microbial communities that colonize the gut for a wide variety of critical functions, including nutrition, immune system maturation, protection against infection by disease-causing microbes, and detoxification of environmental chemicals. Daily life is punctuated by events, such as exposure to antibiotics or other chemicals, or changes in diet, that sometimes disturb or destabilize our microbial communities with potentially severe and sustained negative impacts on health. We propose an ambitious study in which we will monitor the microbial communities of healthy humans before, during and after several types of planned disturbance, and discover community features that predict future stability or future recovery from disturbance, with the expectation that our findings will fundamentally change the practice of medicine.                            ",Predicting Resilience in the Human Microbiome,8549818,R01AI112401,"['Allergic Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Attention', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Taxon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'expectation', 'gut microbiota', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIAID,PALO ALTO VETERANS INSTIT FOR RESEARCH,R01,2013,1235799,0.030627675967877396
"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.

We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced in NHP TB lesions, but silence over the course of several weeks. This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.        This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.

"A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic regulation of gene expression through variation in DNA methylation plays a critical role in a range of biological processes including cellular differentiation, human disease and cancer. New methods for determining the fine structure of methylation patterns genome-wide have led to an explosion of research in this field. Methylation near the gene promoter is correlated with gene silencing, while unmethylated promoters are potentially active. Current computational methods classify genes as either methylated and silenced or unmethylated and potentially active based on a coarse calculation of CpG methylation state across a window of a few hundred base pairs around the transcription start site. The detailed spatial pattern of methylation across the promoter may be an important determinant of gene expression, but current computational methods ignore this valuable information. Recent work has found regions proximal to CpG island promoters, dubbed ""CpG island shores"", whose methylation state correlates with transcription. CpG island shores are loosely defined, however, and this concept is difficult to apply in practice. While other methylation signatures are also likely to correlate with gene expression, a general framework to identify and study them has not been established. New computational tools for identification and correlation of detailed methylation patterns with gene expression are critical for advancing our understanding of the epigenetics of gene regulation. We propose to develop software tools to detect new methylation signatures at gene promoters that correlate with expression. This will be done within a formal framework so that these signatures can be used to determine differentially methylated genes in a variety of study designs. Taking advantage of the fact  that methylation over short ranges are highly correlated, we will interpolate methylation data at individual  CpG sites in a 10 kb window around the TSS to yield a methylation signature at each promoter that is  independent of primary sequence features. We will then use a metric from topology, the discrete Frechet distance, to calculate the similarity between methylation signatures, and apply this metric to cluster signatures of similar type. We will then determine clusters with methylation signatures that correlate with expression.  Clusters that contain both silenced and expressed genes will be examined to see if other local primary sequence features can be used to discriminate the genes based on expression. This approach will be used to detect methylation changes in case-control studies and in pairwise comparisons, such as needed for timecourse analysis or for the detection of different states of differentiation. The general framework developed here can be expanded in the future to examine methylation signatures at enhancers and gene bodies, as well as to histone marks or other genomic signals that carry detailed spatial information.          Narrative  DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine in CpG dinucleotides, is an important  epigenetic regulator of gene expression in cells. DNA methylation has been implicated in a large number of  biological processes including cellular differentiation and cancer. We will develop software tools to analyze  data from new techniques for mapping DNA methylation genome-wide to discover new methylation signatures  that are associated with silenced and active genes. These will include tools to use these signatures to  determine what genes are differentially regulated in different cell types and in human disease.",A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH FOR FINE-SCALE GENOME WIDE DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS,8229567,R21LM011199,"['Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological Process', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG Islands', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Metric', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'methyl group', 'promoter', 'research study', 'software development', 'spatial neglect', 'tool']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2012,152000,0.018226822538160613
"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.           Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.

"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. Project Narrative  The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which  important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.  Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular  defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the  DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and  permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put  certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation  are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or  reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic  intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation,  including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an  important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at  risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential  biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers,8246510,R01CA132065,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alu Elements', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'CpG Islands', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methyltransferase', 'DNA Modification Methylases', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Play', 'Polycomb', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Promoter Regions', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'carcinogenesis', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sound', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,306133,0.06476617962603837
"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8280335,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'graduate student', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,288150,-0.027166053866070596
"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available. Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process. We show that pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways, initially induced in NHP TB lesions, are overwhelmingly silenced over the course of next several weeks. This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these responses could reflect the efforts of the pathogen to prevent excessive immunopathology during the infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection. Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation with the clinical, microbiological and immunological data obtained from infected NHPs will generate statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB. The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions. The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific gene LAG3 will be silenced in NHPs using a novel lipidated-siRNA nanoparticle based approach. The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific profiles will be determined in human patients of latent and active TB, as well as TB/AIDS co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans. Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.         There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.

"MACHINE LEARNING TO FORECAST ZOONOTIC DISEASE EMERGENCE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As over 70% of emerging infectious diseases are caused by parasites or pathogens transmitted from animals to humans (leading to 'zoonotic' infections), a fundamental issues for public health is identifying the drivers leading to zoonotic diseases in humans. Cross-species transmission of infectious agents depends on numerous traits of hosts, their infectious agents, and environmental factors defining the external context of disease. Previous studies identifying predictors of cross-species transmission have been limited by a focus on single infectious diseases (e.g., rabies, Lyme disease) at restricted spatial scales, in part because large-scale analyses spanning numerous host species and infectious agents are precluded by the many complex interactions, autocorrelations, and sampling biases common in multivariate, high-dimensional data. The proposed research confronts these computational limitations through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms. Specifically, analyses will address three outstanding and interrelated questions in global health: (1) What characteristics signal a predisposition of mammalian host species to be reservoirs of zoonotic disease?; (2) What traits among infectious agents predict their potential to cause zoonotic infection?; (3) What are the most important environmental and anthropogenic predictors of zoonotic outbreaks globally? Analyses will apply a series of supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised machine learning algorithms to new, global-scale databases containing biological, ecological, environmental, and anthropogenic data for three groups of mammalian hosts (primates, carnivores, and ungulates) and their zoonotic infectious agents. A long-term goal of this research is to empirically develop ""rules of thumb"" about zoonotic diseases by highlighting the key traits of mammalian hosts, infectious agents, and the environmental and human factors describing zoonotic outbreaks in recent history. Ultimately, research proposed herein will provide a basis for predicting the geographic locations, infectious agents, and animal reservoirs from which future zoonoses will emerge.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment. Ultimately, this project aims to predict the locations and species from which future diseases will emerge, and is therefore directly relevant for the improvement of human health.           This project proposes to investigate the factors driving zoonotic disease outbreaks and cross-species transmission from wild mammals into humans through the innovative application of machine learning algorithms to newly published data describing hundreds of infectious agents, their mammalian host species, human populations, and the global environment.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,8100430,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,288150,-0.027166053866070596
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome."" The proposed work will improve the maps of biologically functional DNA sequences in humans, which in turn will help explain how variants in human genome sequences could be associated with human diseases, leading to candidates for novel avenues for effective therapy and prevention.

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.  Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation.     Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  but  silence  over  the  course  of  several  weeks.  This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.  Towards  this,  we  have  assembled  a  highly  diverse  and  collaborative  team  including  microbiologists,  aerobiologists,  bioinformaticians,  mathematicians/statisticians,  veterinarians,  veterinary  pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Epigenome Interactions in Complex Neurogenetic Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Modifications of DNA and chromatin impact the accessibility of the genetic code to the biological machinery of the cell. Relating epigenomic changes to neurodevelopmental disorders has been challenging. One obstacle is the need to study the relevant tissues at an appropriate stage of the disease process, while another is the difficulty of understanding the relationship of nucleotide and chromatin modifications to complex genetic disorders in which multiple loci interactions underlie expression of the disease. We propose to take advantage of a disorder, neural tube defects (NTDs), in which the existing mouse models closely parallel the human disease and in which several lines of evidence indicate a strong influence in both mouse and man of epigenetic modifications regulating disease expression. We will combine proof of principle studies in the mouse with investigations of human NTD cohorts to examine the relationship between DNA/chromatin methylation and the expressivity of NTDs in genetically susceptible individuals.  The study of epigenetic events contributing to NTDs has multiple distinct advantages over epigenomic investigation of other human diseases, as more than 200 genes are implicated in NTDs by human or animal studies. These provide critical clues to molecular pathways important for normal neurulation. Supporting the existing clinical data, we discovered several NTD-prone mouse mutant lines in which NTD occurrence is sensitive to folic acid supplementation. Folate metabolism is the source of al S-adenosyl methoinine (SAM), which is the primary methyl donor for methylating nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Providing methyl donors is thought to be a major route through which folate supplementation exerts its beneficial effects on neurulation. We will use cutting edge and emerging technologies applied to mouse and human patient material to interrogate genome wide methylation and chromatin remodeling interactions, correlated with individual genotype, to examine epigenetic effects on the transcriptome and on phenotypic outcome.  This proposal tests the hypothesis that epigenetic modifications in DNA and chromatin in the setting of prenatal supplementation that modulates DNA and chromatin methylation will impact a recognizable pattern of gene expression to either favor or impair neurulation in a manner that can be predicted based on individual genotype. Moreover, we hypothesize that certain patterns will be evident not only in the developing neural tube but also in the peripheral blood and so will be useful in evaluating risk and optimal NTD prevention in a clinical setting. We predict that some DNA and chromatin methylation signatures acquired in utero wil persist postnatally, regardless of whether supplementation continues after birth. Finally, we expect that DNA methylation patterns found in mouse will be present as well-at least at the level of pathways if not individual genes-in human patients affected by an NTD.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed. This would enable NTD prevention strategies to be optimized for each family, rather than basing recommendations on whole populations. With our food supply now fortified, folic acid has become the most widely administered medicinal agent in the US today. Therefore, this study will also have broad relevance to human disorders in which folate intake has an implicated role, including major depression, autism, Alzheimer's disease, among others.            There is a critical need to identify patterns of human genetic--modified by epigenetic--variation that will allow individual risks to be accurately assessed.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7895064,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,291060,-0.027166053866070596
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Functional activity and inter-organismal interactions in the human microbiome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput sequencing has provided a tool capable of observing the human microbiome, but characterizing the biological roles and metabolic potential of these microbial communities remains a significant challenge. Increasing evidence points to the functional activity of gene products, rather than community taxonomic composition, as the most robust descriptor of the microflora's relationship with its host and as a potential point of intervention in modulating human health. Existing computational tools for exploring a newly sequenced metagenome rely heavily on sequence homology and do not yet leverage information from the thousands of publicly available functional experimental results. Likewise, no previous methods have provided genome-scale computational tools for biological hypothesis generation regarding specific molecular interactions among the microflora and with a human host. This proposal aims to develop computational methodology to interpret the functional activity of microfloral communities: 1. Integrate functional information from taxonomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic datasets. We will develop methodology to unify these three representations of microbiome composition by incorporating  information from large scale functional genomic data collections. 2. Identify genomic predictors of inter-species functional activity, including host/microflora interactions and points of community-wide regulatory feedback. We will computationally screen microbiome assays for molecular interactions and regulatory motifs spanning multiple organisms in the community. 3. Implement these technologies as publicly available, accessible, and interpretable tools. We will provide freely available, open source, downloadable and web-based implementations of this methodology for use  by the bioinformatic and biological communities. As high-throughput sequencing becomes more widely used to study microbial communities in the human microbiome and in the environment, computational tools will be necessary to summarize their global functional activity and systems-level regulatory interactions. In the long term, by providing methodology to understand the human microbiome at the molecular level, we hope to enable its future use as a diagnostic indicator and as a point of intervention to improve human health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA sequencing technology has recently allowed us to examine the microorganisms naturally residing in and on the human body, many of which are beneficial and some of which can be harmful. Although we can now gather data on the cellular behavior of these microbes and on their interactions with human beings, computational tools are needed to interpret this information.

"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.""

"Transcriptomics of Tuberculosis Latency and Reactivation in Primates    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, in a quiescent state. These bacilli are able to reactivate and cause pulmonary TB, when the immune system is compromised. Hence, a complete understanding of TB latency and reactivation is required for the effective control of TB. The research models and tools necessary to perform these studies are now available.   Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB, especially to study the progression of experimental infection to latency, and to study the pathology and biology of granulomatous lesions - the hallmarks of TB infections. We have established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to true Mtb aerosols. While many research groups focus on the bacterial factors of latency and reactivation, we would like to leverage our highly tractable model to identify host signatures and mediators of this process.    We  show  that  pro-inflammatory  immune  signaling  pathways,  initially  induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  are  overwhelmingly  silenced  over  the  course  of  next  several  weeks.  This transcriptional reprogramming could be a host response to changes in bacterial replication and physiology. Further, these  responses  could  reflect  the  efforts  of  the  pathogen  to  prevent  excessive  immunopathology  during  the  infection of lungs. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that host granuloma responses can be used to predict latent and reactivation TB. We propose to perform a systematic study of the ""transcriptome"" and the ""miRNAome"" of NHP lung lesions. Temporal profiles will be obtained from NHPs infected with a low-dose of Mtb aerosols, accurately modeling long-term latent infection.  Profiles will also be obtained from NHPs in which latent TB is reactivated by simian AIDS. These system-wide profiles, in conjugation  with  the  clinical,  microbiological  and  immunological  data  obtained  from  infected  NHPs  will  generate  statistical learning algorithms and mixed effects computational models of latent and reactivation TB.    The relevance of some of the most informative set of genetic predictors available from the data collected will be tested back in both the NHP model, as well as in human patients. The expression profiles of CCL24, CCL25 and CCL27 show negative correlation with all other chemokine ligands and receptors in primate TB granulomas. The expression of these three chemokines is significantly increased in late, rather than early lesions. We hypothesize that these chemokines are important for the long-term maintenance of primate lesions harboring latent Mtb bacilli. The expression of LAG3 was induced more than 40-fold in early primate lesions relative to late ones. LAG3 is a novel marker of Treg cells. We hypothesize that LAG3 is responsible for negatively regulating protective immune responses generated by effector T cells in primate TB lesions.  The expression of ""latency"" specific genes CCL24/25/27 and the ""active-TB: specific  gene  LAG3  will  be  silenced  in  NHPs  using  a  novel  lipidated-siRNA  nanoparticle  based  approach.  The progression of latent disease and its immunological and molecular correlates will then be studied in these animals. Finally, the expression of an immune response to these and other ""latency"" and ""reactivation""- specific  profiles  will  be  determined  in  human  patients  of  latent  and  active  TB,  as  well  as  TB/AIDS  co- infected patients. These systems-biology studies will likely exponentially enhance our understanding of TB latency and reactivation in a host that mimics both TB and AIDS in the closest possible manner to humans.  Eventually, these advances may empower clinicians better to detect and treat latent TB.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency. A major hurdle in combating TB is the fact Mtb is able to persist for long periods of time in host tissues, reactivating when the immune system is compromised.  Hence, effective and long-term control of TB requires a better understanding of TB latency and reactivation.     Nonhuman Primates (NHPs) are excellent models of TB. We have recently established a model of human TB, by exposing NHPs to Mtb aerosols. Pro-inflammatory immune signaling pathways are initially induced  in  NHP  TB  lesions,  but  silence  over  the  course  of  several  weeks.  This could be a response to the progression of Mtb to a latent phase of growth within these NHP granulomas. We will employ a systems biology approach to study the host granulomatous response to Mtb latency and reactivation, using our NHP model.  Towards  this,  we  have  assembled  a  highly  diverse  and  collaborative  team  including  microbiologists,  aerobiologists,  bioinformaticians,  mathematicians/statisticians,  veterinarians,  veterinary  pathologists, as well as infectious disease and critical respiratory care clinicians/clinician-researchers.               NARRATIVE    Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a global infectious disease emergency.

"Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid advance of nanotechnology has generated much excitement in the scientific and engineering community. Its application to the biological front created the new area of single-molecule biology: Scientists were able to investigate biological processes on a molecule-by-molecule basis, opening the door to addressing many problems that were inaccessible just a few decades ago. The new frontier also raises many statistical challenges, calling upon an urgent need for new statistical inference tools and new stochastic models because of the stochastic nature of single-molecule experiments and because many classical models derived from oversimplified assumptions are no longer valid for single-molecule experiments. The current proposal focuses on the statistical challenges in the single-molecule approach to biology. The proposed research consists of three projects: (1) Using stochastic networks to model enzymatic reaction kinetics. The goal is to provide models not only biologically meaningful, but also capable of explaining the recent single-molecule experimental discoveries that contradict the classical Michaelis-Menten model. (2) Using the kernel method to infer biochemical properties from doubly stochastic Poisson process data, in particular, photon arrival data from single-molecule experiments. The goal is to develop nonparametric inference tools to recover the dependence structure, such as the autocorrelation function, from the doubly stochastic Poisson data. (3) Using bootstrap moment estimates to infer the helical diffusion of DNA-binding proteins. The goal is to elucidate how DNA-binding proteins interact with DNA, and estimate the associated energy landscape. The proposed research aims to provide essential statistical models and inference tools to study biological processes at the single-molecule level and to advance significantly our understanding of how important biological processes such as enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions actually occur in our cells. The single-molecule approach to biology presents many opportunities for interdisciplinary research, calling upon collective efforts from mathematical, biological and physical scientists. The proposed research seeks to meet a high academic standard and aims to reach out to the general scientific community to collaborate and cross-fertilize the interdisciplinary field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to human health because both enzymatic reactions and protein-DNA interactions play fundamental roles in the healthy function of our cells. For example, deficiency of the beta- galactosidase, an enzyme studied in the proposal, can result in galactosialidosis or Morquio B syndrome; the misfunction of hOgg1, a DNA-repair protein studied in this proposal, can result in harmful genetic mutations.       	       n/a",Statistical Models and Inference in the Single-Molecule Approach to Biology,7787322,R01GM090202,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA repair protein', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diffusion', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Gangliosidosis GM1', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'frontier', 'meetings', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,294000,-0.027166053866070596
"Defining Genomic Signatures for Aberrant DNA Methylation in Human Cancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epigenetic silencing involving alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin structure at promoter region CpG islands is a common mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation in human cancers. However, the mechanisms underlying this event remain poorly understood. An unresolved question is why are some genes targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers while others are never affected? In preliminary work, we have shown that even in the context of an increased cellular capacity for de novo methylation, CpG islands differ in their potential for aberrant methylation. By applying DNA pattern recognition and machine learning techniques, we have developed an algorithm based on several short sequence patterns that is capable of accurately discriminating methylation-prone and methylation-resistant CpG islands. These studies indicate that the epigenetic status of a CpG island can be predicted based on DNA sequence features, and lead us to propose that one factor contributing to the non-random patterns of CpG island methylation observed in human tumors is an underlying susceptibility conferred by local sequence context. The goal of this proposal is to define the genomic signature associated with aberrant methylation. The long term objectives are (i) to identify and to functionally characterize local sequence attributes that contribute to the propensity towards, or protection from, aberrant methylation, and (ii) to develop and to test novel tumor specific classifiers capable of predicting genomic loci at risk of aberrant methylation. Specifically, we will determine whether sequence features identified in silico act in cis to promote or to prevent de novo methylation in vivo using an episomal transgene approach. In preliminary work, we have identified a relationship between methylation-prone CpG islands and genomic regions bound by the polycomb repressor complex. As a second component of the project, we will determine the role of PRC2 in methylation susceptibility. As a third component of this project we will refine our computational models by 1) determining whether CpG islands predicted to be methylation-prone are in fact targets of aberrant methylation in human cancers, 2) using this information to re-train the prediction model, and 3) developing and testing a novel lung cancer specific classifier based on large-scale CpG island methylation data from primary lung tumors. We anticipate that the information gained from these studies will allow for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes that accompanies carcinogenesis. Moreover, the ability to predict the methylation status of CpG islands genome-wide will provide an important resource for the identification of novel gene targets for further study as potential cancer biomarkers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers. Although the consequences of this event are the same as a mutation, there is no molecular defect in the DNA sequence itself. Rather, there is a problem with methylation marks on the DNA and the histone proteins it is wrapped around that render certain genes abnormally and permanently silent. We plan to use a computational approach to identify DNA features that put certain genes at risk of aberrant methylation. Because genes that are silenced by methylation are otherwise structurally sound, the potential for reactivating these genes by blocking or reversing the methylation process represents an exciting molecular target for chemotherapeutic intervention. A better understanding of the factors that contribute to aberrant methylation, including the identification of sequence features that attract or repel DNA methylation, will be an important step in achieving this long-term goal. Moreover, the ability to identify those genes at risk of epigenetic silencing will provide novel molecular targets for further study as potential biomarkers for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.           Project Narrative The overarching goal of this research is to better understand the mechanisms by which important growth regulatory genes are targeted for epigenetic silencing in human cancers.

"Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Discordant phenotypes and varying incidences of complex diseases in monozygotic twins as well as genetically identical organisms have long been attributed to differential environmental exposures. Accumulating evidence indicates, however, that epigenetic gene dysregulation by DNA methylation and histone modifications from environmental exposures also play a role in this differential susceptibility to disease. Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7650125,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'offspring']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,578836,-0.0037693857223620214
"Enhance human ENCODE by function comparisons to mouse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to discover and use relationships between mouse and human regulatory genomes to advance the ENCODE Project in its effort to map all functional elements in the human genome. Our comparative approach aims to uncover principles and solve problems that are proving difficult by studying the human genome alone. ENCODE is vigorously mapping hundreds of function-associated biochemical markers in selected cell lines, resulting already in tens of millions of reproducible biochemical features. Some observed protein:DNA interactions find and refine known transcriptional enhancers, promoters, silencers, together with associated chromatin structure, as was anticipated. But substantial questions arise as to how many of the myriad biochemical events are functional, what those functions are, which gene or genes are meaningful targets, etc. To highlight and sort functionally important biochemical marks from others, we will systematically identify the molecular events retained by both mouse and human since they diverged. We will then analyze how conservation of biochemical features relates to conservation of DNA sequence and conservation of regulated gene expression. By using the mouse, we can leverage decades of molecular genetics and manipulated mouse genomes that do not exist in any other mammal. In Aim 1 we execute genome-wide assays for biochemical signatures of functional DNA sequences in a few specific mouse cell types. By using well-studied mouse lines and cell states, we can interpret results in light of previously validated elements and in light of ENCODE human results. We will use ENCODE standards for high throughput, sequence-based assays to determine gene expression, DNase hypersensitive sites, histone modifications and selected transcription factor occupancy in seven mouse cell types. The eight selected features are the most informative ones for function, and thus most useful for comparison with human data. In Aim 2, we apply a genome-wide implementation of chromosome conformation capture to map the interactions between transcription factor binding sites and their responsive genes in two cell types. These results will be compared to those from an ENCODE developmental project. Comparative analysis in Aim 3 will insure that the impact of the data we produce will go beyond the individual mouse cell systems per se. To do this we have organized a collaboration of investigators at multiple institutions, in which each group is expert in one or more critical aspects. Our data, made public and accessible via ENCODE, will fuel and accelerate many future studies after the 2-yr stimulus both in and beyond ENCODE. This responds to NHGRI request for applications on ""Enhancement of the value of the human ENCODE Project by conducting a parallel effort on the mouse genome.""

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,-0.014859081114754076
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7447802,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,100329,0.025469868788939972

Thus, the overarching hypothesis of this grant application is that early exposure to environmental agents influences adult disease susceptibility by causing stable alterations in critical DNA control elements that regulate metastable epialleles - genes whose epigenome is established probabilistically during development, leading to variable gene expressivity and widely varying individual adult phenotypes. Despite a growing consensus on the importance of epigenetics in the etiology of chronic human diseases, the genes most prone to epigenetic dysregulation are incompletely defined. Moreover, neither the environmental agents most strongly affecting the epigenome nor the critical windows of vulnerability to environmentally induced epigenetic alterations have been characterized. These major deficits in knowledge have severely constrained our ability to systematically define and characterize the metastable epialleles mechanistically involved in the etiology of human diseases. The overall objective of this grant application is to help correct these deficiencies by using the viable yellow Agouti (Avy) mouse model, as well as human samples to identify environmentally responsive, metastable epialleles in the mouse and human genomes. Specifically, the intent is to determine if maternal dietary supplementation of Avy mice with low levels of the plasticizer bisphenol A (BPA) affects adult phenotype of the offspring by altering the fetal epigenome. Gene expression and genome-wide bioinformatic approaches to identify imprinted and non-imprinted metastable epialleles in both mice and humans will be employed. The results of this study should ultimately allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of chronic human diseases such as asthma, diabetes, cancer, obesity and neurological disorders by targeting the epigenome rather than the genome. They will also be helpful in determining under what circumstances the mouse is an appropriate toxicological model for assessing human risk from agents that elicit their biological effect primarily by altering the epigenome.             n/a",Identification and Characterization of Epigenetically Labile Genes,7478414,R01ES015165,"['Acids', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Asthma', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Blood specimen', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Figs - dietary', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genistein', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Germ Layers', 'Health', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Exposure', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic Twinning', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Production', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supplementation', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Xenobiotics', 'bisphenol A', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'environmental agent', 'fetal', 'human birth weight', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'improved', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'toxicant', 'uptake']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,577197,-0.0037693857223620214
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,0.025469868788939972

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7261326,R01GM072740,[' '],NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2007,290853,-0.014859081114754076

However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,-0.014422621245276544

"Statistical Models in Epigenomics The primary objective of this proposal is to develop statistical models for the analysis of DNA methylation data. Questions that are currently posed for gene expression profiles, such as how to classify samples based on cell-wide gene expression patterns or how to classify genes with unknown function, based on their expression patterns across samples, may be similarly posed for DNA methylation patterns.  Our focus is on the discovery of new subgroups based on patterns of DNA methylation.  We view DNA methylation patterns as an intermediate variable along a pathway from exposures to outcomes and take a flexible hierarchical modeling approach that can incorporate measured and unmeasured covariates.  Our aims are motivated by ongoing and planned future studies in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Norris Cancer Center at the University of Southern California.  Specifically, we propose to: 1. Develop model-based class discovery methods (cluster analysis/unsupervised learning approaches) using quantitative measures of DNA methylation, adjusting for locus-specific and sample-specific covariate effects. a. Analysis of paired samples of tumor tissue and normal tissue taken from the margin of the tumor. b. Extend model to allow for multiple tumors per subject. c. Extend model to a two-dimensional cluster analysis of samples and loci. 2. Develop models for characterizing methylation patterns as an intermediate variable by modeling a) the association between risk factors and methylation pattern clusters, and b) the association between methylation pattern clusters and outcome. 3.

"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,0.022334907732007827
"Uncovering the epitranscriptome regulatory codes using machine learning Project Summary N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant methylation widely found in mRNAs of mammalian cells whose function is largely unknown. Recent research has accumulated increasingly strong evidence of m6A's involvement in different diseases such as leukemia, breast cancer, lung cancer, and AIDs. While m6A's close involvement in many diseases is apparent, mechanistic evidence linking m6A alterations to disease phenotypes is mostly missing. Most of the recent research is fueled by the high throughput sequencing technologies such as MeRIP-seq for transcriptome-wide profiling of m6A methylation. However, due to the innate limitations of such technologies, sophisticated machine learning based algorithms are urgently needed to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels and the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A. Without bridging these knowledge gaps, it is impossible to made inroads to the problem of finding m6A's role in regulating diseases. To address these issues, our aims in this proposal are 1) Establish a deep learning algorithm for base-resolution m6A site prediction; 2) Establish base- resolution m6A differential site prediction using a hierarchical Bayesian approach; and 3) Determine m6A- mediated genes and functions by Bayesian Negative-Binomial regression. The proposed research will employ deep learning and adversarial learned inference methods and utilize both methylation quantification and sequence information for the first time. Also, it will employ Bayesian graphical model-based methods for combining sequence and methylation level information. It is expected that the developed algorithms will have broad applications in functional study, for which we plan to closely work with our collaborators in applying these algorithms in their research of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), which will lead to the fulfillment our long term goal in the eventual validation and practical medical application of m6A research in the future. Project Narrative  This project proposes to address the problem of detecting m6A sites with high sensitivity and precision, accurate quantification of m6A methylation levels, the prediction of m6A sites differentially affected under disease and normal conditions and the prediction of genes whose expression levels are regulated by m6A.

"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9938424,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,710049,0.03428345271664345
"Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics The human microbiota plays an important role in health and disease, and its therapeutic manipulation is being actively investigated for a wide range of diseases that span every NIH institute. Our microbiota are inherently dynamic, and analyzing these time-dependent properties is key to robustly linking the microbiota to disease, and predicting the effects of therapies targeting the microbiota; indeed, longitudinal microbiome data is being acquired with increasing frequency, and is a major component of many NIH-funded projects. However, there is currently a dearth of computational tools for analyzing microbiome time-series data, which presents several special challenges including high measurement noise, irregular and sparse temporal sampling, and complex dependencies between variables. The objective of this proposal is to introduce new capabilities, improve on, and provide state-of-the-art implementations of tools for analyzing dynamics, or patterns of change in microbiome time-series data. The tools we develop will use Bayesian machine learning methods, which are well-recognized for their strong conceptual and practical advantages, particularly in biomedical domains. Tools will be rigorously tested and validated on synthetic and real human microbiome data, including publicly available datasets and those from collaborators providing 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomic, and metabolomics data. We propose three specific aims. For Aim 1, we will develop integrated Bayesian machine learning tools for predicting population dynamics of the microbiome and its responses to perturbations. These tools will include a new model that simultaneously learns groups of microbes with similar interaction structure and predicts their behavior over time, and that incorporates prior phylogenetic information. The model will be further improved by incorporating stochastic microbial dynamics and errors in measurements throughout the model. For Aim 2, we will develop Bayesian machine learning tools to predict host status from microbiome dynamics. The tools will learn easily interpretable, human-readable rules that predict host status from microbiome time-series data, and will be further extended to handle a variety of longitudinal study designs. For Aim 3, we will engineer our microbiome dynamics analysis software tools for optimal performance, ease-of- use, maintainability, extensibility, and dissemination to the community. In total, the proposed work will yield a suite of contemporary software tools for analyzing microbiome dynamics, with expected broad use and major impact. The software will allow investigators to answer important scientific and translational questions about the microbiome, including discovering which microbial taxa or their metagenomes are affected over time by perturbations such as changes in diet or invasion by pathogens; predicting the effects of these perturbations over time, including changes in composition or stability of the gut microbiota; and finding temporal signatures in multi-‘omic microbiome data that predict disease risk in the human host. The human microbiota, or collection of micro-organisms living on and within us, plays an important role in health, and when disrupted or abnormal, may contribute to many types of diseases including infections, kidney diseases, bowel diseases, diabetes, heart diseases, arthritis, allergies, brain diseases, and cancer. Sophisticated computer-based tools are needed to make sense of human microbiota data, particularly time- series data, which can yield important insights into how our microbiomes change over time. This work will develop new and improved computer-based tools for analyzing microbiota time-series data, which will be made freely available and will enable scientists to increase our fundamental knowledge about how our microbiota affect us and ultimately to apply this knowledge to prevent and treat human illnesses.",Bayesian Machine Learning Tools for Analyzing Microbiome Dynamics,10015315,R01GM130777,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Population Dynamics', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Readability', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human microbiota', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'man', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiome sequencing', 'microbiota', 'microorganism', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'software development', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIGMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,312939,0.02697699844261614
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state.

"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks. A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings. Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.  The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross- talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population- level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements) in each group.  This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort studies and will be available as open-source software. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent technological advances have enabled the production of large immune monitoring datasets, providing an opportunity for systems-level efforts to harness the power of the immune system in developing immune therapies and diagnostic tests. In this project, we will develop machine learning algorithms for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell level, in a multiomics setting integrated with various other biological measurements, and subject to adjustments based on population-level factors. This work will provide a strong quantitative bridge between large-scale epidemiologic trends and deep biological profiling to investigate the complex mechanisms that govern the immune system in clinical settings.",Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings,10028766,R35GM138353,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Foundations', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteome', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological systems', 'cohort', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolome', 'microbiome', 'multiple omics', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'programs', 'response']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R35,2020,382710,0.009903810642721472
"Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation Abstract Large numbers of complete methylomes are being acquired through clinical sequencing projects, such as through The Cancer Genome Atlas, Blueprint Epigenome Project, and International Cancer Genome Consortium. Furthermore, third-generation nanopore sequencers, which detect DNA methylation and genetic variation in a single experiment, are nearly ready for routine clinical sequencing and will provide complete methylomes for all patients where whole-genome sequencing is indicated. Current analysis tools however only perform preliminary methylome processing and catalogue differentially methylated regions (DMRs). In order to transform methylome analysis into a clinically useful diagnostic/prognostic test, we need to develop predictive tools to interpret the functional and pathological consequences of identified methylation changes. Towards this goal, we have published a series of papers demonstrating that machine-learning based models utilizing high- resolution signatures of all methylation changes around a promoter vastly outperform conventional DMR methods. Our models accurately predict expression states at genes potentially regulated by methylation and reveal predictive methylation signatures that facilitate mechanistic interpretation. Nonetheless, several challenges remain before we can achieve our goals of translating genome-wide methylation data for routine clinical use: (1) To our knowledge, no current models integrate distal enhancers, whose activation is affected by DNA methylation. Such integrative analysis is necessary to understand consequences of methylation changes in cancers, whose genomes frequently undergo wide-spread methylation changes. In addition, such modelling will be essential to understand the role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), which may play both repressive and activating roles in neurons depending on whether it is found at promoters or enhancers. (2) Our current models (and conventional approaches) represent methylation data independent of DNA sequence despite mechanistic studies demonstrating that methylation changes can have different functional effects depending on which sequences change and depending on the context of the local regulatory grammar. In this proposal, we will meet these challenges by first developing a predictive model that incorporates 5-methylcytosine and 5hmC at promoters and enhancers to determine how these marks act in concert. In particular, we will examine the hypothesized dual role of 5hmC as a repressor at promoters and as an activator at enhancers in cortical neurons. We will then use new advances in natural language processing to model DNA sequence and methylation to predict expression states. Our results will reveal which regulatory elements and transcription factors binding sites are affected by DNA methylation and how changes at different sites collaborate to affect expression changes. We will experimentally validate our in silico predictions using a combination of reporter assays and CRISPR- based epigenome-editing tools. Thus, the software tools we develop will form an important toolkit for the analysis and mechanistic interpretation of whole-genome methylation studies, both in the laboratory and clinic. Public Narrative DNA normally undergoes a variety of chemical modifications including the addition of methyl- and hydroxymethyl- groups to cytosines (DNA methylation). Though we are unsure how to interpret them, abnormal patterns of DNA methylation are often found in human diseases and will likely soon be routinely measured in the clinic. In this proposal, we will develop advanced computational approaches to predict the functional and pathological consequences of DNA methylation changes in disease. In the future, the approaches we develop will lead to software that suggests individualized therapies for patients based on clinical methylation data.",Computational modeling of DNA methylation-mediated gene regulation,10018936,R01LM013096,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'International', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translating', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer type', 'clinical sequencing', 'cofactor', 'demethylation', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'individualized medicine', 'long short term memory network', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'nanopore', 'network architecture', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,350896,0.041635997651900486
"Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging Project Summary Understanding the biochemical processes underlying aging that give rise to age-related pathologies is the central concept of geroscience research. A focus in geroscience is to identify interventions that slow/prevent aging. These could both alter the trajectory of aging and have beneficial effects across a number of diseases, delaying onset or slowing progression. However, evaluating anti-aging interventions requires years-long studies in mammalian model organisms and is almost impossible in clinical trials that would require of multi-year studies to evaluate lifespan and healthspan extensions. The solution to this problem lies in developing endpoints that indicate biological age and the health-related changes that go with it with sufficient sensitivity. The recent development of epigenetic clocks, chronological age-predictive machine learning models that use DNA cytosine methylation data, are leading the field in age estimation accuracy and precision. The difference between a person’s chronological age and the estimated “methylation age” has been proposed as a measure of aging acceleration or deceleration – a ‘biological age’. Age acceleration predicted by methylation has shown robust correlations to all-cause mortality risk, but weak correlations in age-related diseases. Age-related biological outcomes such as cognitive decline have found little to no association with methylation age acceleration. Put simply, epigenetic clocks have been developed to predict chronological age but have so far demonstrated marginal utility to predict disease states. However, our preliminary results indicate that as many as 20% of genomic cytosines have age-related methylation changes which may be leveraged to understand biological aging and its outcomes simultaneously. Using the largest collection of methylation data with disease, age, tissue, and sex labels from our previous work in natural language processing, we will create the first model of epigenetic aging to identify “healthy” aging loci and disease-predictive loci. These loci will give us insight into the molecular pathways disturbed by age-related methylation changes, providing targets for therapeutic intervention and a predictor for patient disease risk. However, it is still unknown how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’, especially considering their performance across tissues. We will test how epigenetic changes with age are distributed throughout specific cell types in the central nervous system and cell types common across all tissues – such as vascular endothelium and immune cells. Using single-cell bisulfite sequencing and cell-type specific promoter-driven labelling, we can detect if the epigenetic clock changes are truly occurring in all cells or if they are restricted to some cell types common across tissues. This information is critical for predicting the downstream effects of changes identified by epigenetic clocks and interpreting the effects of ‘reversing’ epigenetic aging. These experiments will further our understanding of the role epigenetics play in the aging process and in neurological diseases of age such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Project Narrative Epigenetic clocks, models of DNA methylation changes with age, have been shown as robust biomarkers for aging and all-cause mortality risk, but weakly predict disease risk and thus biological aging. This proposed research plan will generate a new epigenetic model by identifying loci predictive of both age and disease to create an Epigenetic Vulnerability Estimator (EVE), granting insights into disease-associated pathways affected by DNA methylation aging. We will also determine how epigenetic clocks ‘tick’ in the brain using cell-type specific single-cell bisulfite sequencing to understand what cellular populations are reflecting both age-related epigenetic dysregulation and potentially responding to anti-aging interventions.",Mathematical Models of Vulnerability and Cell-Type Specific Analysis of DNA Modifications in Aging,10067953,F31AG063493,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deceleration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Enhancers', 'Entropy', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Euchromatin', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methylation', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phagocytes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Ribosomes', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Ticks', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'animal data', 'anti aging', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'healthspan', 'healthy aging', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'sex', 'single cell sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,F31,2020,34001,0.01605049543593714
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide.

"NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume Project Summary  Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection, despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).  Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple, low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction. These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently, we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.  In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance (predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs. Project Narrative NeoChip combines real-time PCR, digital High Resolution Melting (dHRM) of DNA and RNA, and machine learning to create unique “fingerprints"" for microbes and antimicrobial resistance, allowing for faster and more precise detection of pathogen(s) causing neonatal infection. This project will build out NeoChip’s melt curve database to include clinically relevant strains of cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus infections, while concordantly assembling updated epidemiologic timelines and prevalence of perinatal CMV and HSV transmission. Our goals are to validate NeoChip for the rapid and specific diagnosis of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infection on multiple tissue matrices and translate the NeoChip platform for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening for the diagnosis of congenital cytomegalovirus on dried blood spot samples.",NeoChip for specific and rapid identification of congenital CMV and neonatal HSV infections on minimal sample volume,10050866,R01HD099250,"['Address', 'Advocate', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral resistance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital herpes simplex', 'Consumption', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogen detection', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prevalence', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simplexvirus', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus Diseases', 'accurate diagnosis', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital cytomegalovirus', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'digital', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'intervention program', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melting', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal infection', 'neonate', 'next generation sequencing', 'offspring', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genomics', 'pathogenic virus', 'point of care', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'resistance gene', 'screening program', 'single molecule', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'viral detection']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,671761,-0.007434607619561414
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10050030,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,535171,-0.009316896172624324
"CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement Abstract  This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-20-032. This is a supplement to U54 CA242646, “California-Mexico-Puerto Rico Partnership (CAMPO) Center for Prevention of HPV-related Cancer in HIV+ Populations”. The parent grant's focus is to perform research on reducing the risk of cervical and anal cancer in men and women living with HIV in Latin America. CAMPO Study 1 will enroll 4000 women and 1000 men living with HIV to optimize screening algorithms to detect cervical and anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL). The incidence of anal cancer is high among all groups of Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially among those in Puerto Rico (PR). HPV infection is necessary but insufficient for the development of anal HSIL and cancer. The goal of this supplement is to elucidate the role of the anal microbiome as a contributor to this increased risk of anal cancer risk in these high-risk populations. Specific aims are 1) Study the relationship between anal high- risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and PR; and 2) Study the relationship between anal HSIL and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV infection. These populations are of particular interest given their divergent lifestyles but similarity in genetic background. We hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH without anal HSIL, the microbiome will be different among those with and without hr-HPV infection. We hypothesize that the proportion with pro-inflammatory-mediating taxa will be highest among the PR population compared with the Mexican and California populations given the higher incidence in anal cancer in PR. We also hypothesize that among Hispanic PLWH with anal hr-HPV at the 3 locations, detection of HSIL will be associated with a pro-inflammatory microbiome and a decrease in butyrate-producing signatures, with the proportion with pro-inflammatory changes highest in PR compared with the other populations.  We will enroll 100 PLWH (50 men and 50 women) at each of the PR, Mexico City and San Francisco CAMPO sites, for a total of 300 Hispanic PLWH. Data on anal HPV, anal cytology and anal HSIL will be available through CAMPO Study 1 in PR and Mexico City, and from the San Francisco ANCRE Clinic, where PLWH are screened for anal HSIL as part of routine clinical care. A validated food frequency questionnaire in Spanish will be administered to assess dietary intake for the previous 3 and 6 months. Anal swab specimens will be retrieved from the CAMPO Biorepository and used for microbiome analysis. The 16S gene will be amplified from extracted anal swab genomic DNA and subjected to Illumina Miseq. Sequences of the 16S gene V4 region will be analyzed in QIIME2. Random forest classification will be performed to understand how our predictors, i.e. microbiome variables (diversity measurements, species-level taxa) and other covariates (sociodemographics, sex, diet, clinical data, etc.), are associated with hr-HPV infection or HSIL (outcomes). Narrative As the incidence of anal cancer is high in Hispanic people living with HIV (PLWH), especially in Puerto Rico, this supplement aims to study the relationship between anal high-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection, anal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and the anal microbiome among three distinct populations of Hispanic PLWH in California, Mexico and Puerto Rico (PR). Building on the parent U54 California-Mexico-Puerto Rico (CAMPO) Consortium infrastructure, we will enroll 300 Hispanic PLWH from the study sites, collect anal swabs for anal HPV testing, cytology and microbiome analysis, perform high resolution anoscopy and collect data to assess dietary intake. The anal microbiota profiles will be analyzed among the three Hispanic populations and will shed light on the role of the anal microbiome in potentiating anal HPV-related anal disease in these high- risk populations.",CAMPO Global Cancer Health Disparities Supplement,10166395,U54CA242646,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Biopsy', 'Butyrates', 'California', 'Cervical', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Data', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic DNA', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Hispanics', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Incidence', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Latin America', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of anus', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncoproteins', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Probiotics', 'Puerto Rico', 'Questionnaires', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Squamous intraepithelial lesion', 'Swab', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'biobank', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer risk', 'cervical and anal cancer', 'clinical care', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'interest', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'microbiome', 'microbiome analysis', 'microbiota', 'microbiota profiles', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'sex', 'sociodemographics', 'therapeutic vaccine']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U54,2020,194934,-0.0716085593052176

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine ABSTRACT Influenza virus (flu) ranks highest in disease burden of all infectious diseases as measured in disability-adjusted life years. Seasonal epidemics cause 200,000-500,000 worldwide deaths annually. The total economic burden of seasonal flu is estimated to range from approximately $26B to $87B each year in the US in terms of direct medical expenses and lost work and productivity. Additionally, at least six known flu pandemics have become global human catastrophes, most notably the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, which killed 3-5% of the world’s population. Any reduction in the infection rate, transmission, and severity of flu infection would greatly reduce our healthcare expenditures and improve the quality of life for millions of people every year. The current vaccines are formulated annually based on predictions of which circulating flu strains may be prevalent in a given season. The effectiveness of these vaccines varies from year to year based on the circulation of unexpected antigenic variants and other factors. Vaccine design is complicated the by the multiplicity of flu strains, each with rapidly-evolving dominant antigen epitopes (“decoy” epitopes) that largely stimulate strain- restricted immunity. One strategy for rational antigen design, termed Immune Refocusing Technology (IRT), involves introducing mutations that reduce the immunogenicity of these decoy epitopes thus shifting the immune response to target more widely-conserved subdominant epitopes. BMI has previously applied this IRT approach with some notable successes to other viral antigens (e.g. HRV and the RSV F protein), and we now focus on the major flu surface antigen glycoprotein HA using H1, H3, and B vaccine strains as parental antigens. The anticipated effort to design a suitably modified antigen would ordinarily involve a protracted process of trial-and-error testing of many potential candidates. However, we have recently developed the ANATOPE automated B cell epitope prediction software package with algorithm parameters tuned using methods in artificial intelligence. Our algorithm identifies epitopes with a significantly higher success rate than previously available prediction programs. This breakthrough allows us to assign immunogenicity “strength” scores to particular antigen surface patches and will further guide and accelerate the design of mutant antigens that refocus the immune response to cross-strain conserved epitopes. In this application, we propose to engineer and test the immunogenicity of rationally-designed HA antigens containing mutations that both 1) dampen the immunogenicity of dominant strain-restricted decoy epitopes and 2) enhance the immunogenicity of conserved subdominant epitopes associated with broadly neutralizing antibodies. Follow- up studies will assess the rationally-designed antigens in a ferret challenge study and prepare the approach for translation into humans as a universal vaccine that does not require annual reformulation. NARRATIVE Influenza is among the most important pathogens in terms of negative impact upon human health and healthcare expense. The current seasonal vaccines have a mixed record in terms of preventing illness and death. Development of improved vaccines is complicated by the rapid antigenic evolution of circulating viruses and the strain-restricted protections developed by our immune systems. In this proposal, we combine two novel technologies to develop universal influenza vaccines. The first, the Immune Refocusing Technology, is used to alter antibody binding sites, epitopes, such that the immune system can produce a broadened, cross-strain protective response. The second, a computational B cell epitope analysis program called ANATOPE, is used to guide the rational design of antigenic mutants bearing amino acid substitutions that stimulate improved immune responses. This project will focus on improving the breadth of protection stimulated by the three major components of the seasonal vaccine to reduce the need for annual reformulations. If successful, follow-up studies will include additional analysis in alternative animal models, a more comprehensive analysis of T cell immune responses, and preparation for advancement into IND-enabling studies.",Development of a Universal Influenza Vaccine,10080771,R43AI152652,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing Alternatives', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Baculoviruses', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'California', 'Cells', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Distant', 'Economic Burden', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Ferrets', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Ha antigen', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hemagglutination', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hong Kong', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Insecta', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Recombinants', 'Seasons', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Serological', 'Severities', 'Singapore', 'Site', 'Spanish flu', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface Antigens', 'Switzerland', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Translations', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Viral Antibodies', 'Viral Antigens', 'Viral Physiology', 'Virus', 'Work', 'antiviral immunity', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'flu', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'infection rate', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'mutant', 'neutralizing antibody', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine effectiveness']",NIAID,"BIOLOGICAL MIMETICS, INC.",R43,2020,299218,0.01379967994835545
"Role of the gut microbiome in pesticide-induced effects on child neurodevelopment SUMMARY Pesticides are pervasive in our environment, and have accumulated in drinking water reserves serving millions of people worldwide, causing growing concern since the potential adverse health effects are not fully understood. In 2017 alone, the world used about 6.8 million tons of pesticides, of which the world's largest usage is in China and the United States. More recently it has been discovered that pesticides have strong effects on microbial communities, extinguishing entire clades while promoting growth in others. Shifts in microbial composition have been associated with brain development, mood and behavior suggesting a strong link between the gut and the brain. We hypothesize that there may exist an unappreciated microbiome component to the adverse health effects of pesticide exposure. In this proposal, we will use a comprehensive approach to identify the microbial components of pesticide susceptibility to neurodevelopmental delay. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to 11 targeted pesticides on child neurodevelopment in a large well-defined human Mother and Child Microbiome Cohort (MCMC) consisting of 3000 mother and child pairs. Study participants are currently followed up regularly until the children reach 4 years of age. Comprehensive artificial intelligence analysis of pesticide exposure and children's early neurodevelopment data will identify key pesticides that negatively impact child development. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to pesticides can shift the composition of the GM and subsequently lead to abnormal neurodevelopment. We will integrate the child gut microbiome data with maternal pesticide exposure during pregnancy and child neurodevelopment data to investigate the impact of prenatal exposure to targeted pesticides on child gut microbiome and development. This Aim will identify specific gut bacteria or clades associated with child neurodevelopment. In Aim 3, we will use conventional and germ-free mouse models to elucidate mechanisms by which pesticide exposure can affect the gut microbiome and behavior. Conventionally housed pregnant mice will be exposed to pesticides and the gut microbiome and behavior (anxiety, memory, motor performance, social interaction) will be analyzed in their offspring. Also, germ-free mice will be colonized with specific bacteria or bacterial clades to study the causality of the impact of the GM on behavior. The long-term implications for human health are significant – it may be possible to increase tolerance/robustness to pesticide exposure by providing sensitive individuals with probiotics that have select degradation pathways. Moreover, this understanding is important in order to formulate novel preventive strategies including educating health practitioners, families, and public health providers and organizations regarding the potential risks of environmental exposures. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chemical and toxic substances, such as herbicides and pesticides pose some of the most common threats to environmental and human health. Our studies are designed to identify effects of prenatal pesticide exposure on child neurodevelopment and the role of the gut microbiome in mediating pesticide-induced adverse health effects.

"Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Epigenetic memory is a phenomenon of trans-generational, altered trait inheritance without changes to DNA sequence. Our present ability to predict or direct epigenomic behavior is extremely limited, even though epigenetic factors participate in nearly all aspects of multicellular development, environmental stress response, and disease development. There are critical gaps in our current knowledge of DNA methylation patterning, stable epiallele formation, and the relationship of genome-wide epigenomic behavior to gene expression and phenotype in both plant and animal systems. We have developed a system that will directly address these questions. Our long-term goals are to decode the heritable epigenome, and its relationship to organismal phenotype, particularly in response to stress. What distinguishes our proposed research is the availability of robust biologicals in the model plant Arabidopsis to impose artificial stress, recurrent heritable epigenetic memory, and methylome repatterning. These resources emanate from discovery of the MSH1 gene, disruption of which leads to epigenomic reprogramming. Recent data from this system lead to the overarching hypothesis that stress-induced gene expression recruits methylation machinery to gene networks in a non-stochastic manner. To address this hypothesis, we have developed novel genome-wide methylome analysis procedures for high-resolution identification of gene-associated methylation repatterning. These analyses reveal gene networks that are strikingly consistent with phenotype changes, and display repatterning that is intragenic and often subtle, yet reproducible. We have also identified epigenetic components of the DNA methylation and RdDM pathways that are essential to reprogramming based on msh1 double mutant analysis. Building upon strong preliminary data, we propose to pursue three specific aims to characterize trans-generational epigenomic behavior: (1) To delineate stable, de novo epialleles in the Arabidopsis msh1 model system, exploiting a five-generation memory lineage, (2) to develop a mechanistic understanding of stable epiallele formation in response to stress, implementing machine learning and mutant screening, and (3) to test locus-specific mechanics of epiallele establishment, capitalizing on gene relocation to delimit germane local chromatin features. The proposed research will broadly impact the field by providing the first example of inducible epigenomic reprogramming in a non-stochastic pattern that permits machine learning-based predictive modeling and identification of cis-acting sequence features. The results will be pertinent to mammalian systems and, possibly, to diagnostic strategies for diseases with a strong GxE component. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has relevance to public health priorities as we see life style diseases, stress and environmental impacts on health, in utero and throughout development, pose greater challenges to conventional medicine. Environmental stress is a multifaceted influence on health, and epigenomic response is an important, under-investigated factor in cancer, neurodevelopmental, metabolic and toxin-related disorders with high GxE effects. Upon conclusion of the study, we will have defined the architectural features of stable, de novo epiallelic variation, assessed its influence on heritable phenotype, and refined a methodology for high resolution analysis of epigenomic data that is necessary to inform the development of early diagnostics and countermeasures.","Modeling stress-induced, de novo epiallele architecture in the model Arabidopsis as a tractable entrypoint",9983094,R01GM134056,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Arabidopsis', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Modeling', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Complement', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Homeostasis', 'Information Systems', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Nucleosomes', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Model', 'Plants', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Toxin', 'Transgenes', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biophysical properties', 'bisulfite', 'density', 'epigenetic memory', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome-wide', 'histone modification', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'insight', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mutant', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'trait', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,319720,-0.0010859699992249103
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression. Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression.,9861881,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R01,2020,21455,0.029184168639694717
"Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This research program aims to bridge the gap between genomics data generation from clinical samples and our ability to infer and interpret intricate regulatory programs that underpin cell function and dysfunction in human cells. The Ucar laboratory develops and applies computational solutions to uncover complex regulatory programs in human cells and address previously inaccessible questions related to how disruptions in these programs affect human health and disease. The goal is to create computational tools that are versatile, easy to use and in keeping with the ever-increasing sophistication and complexity of NGS data. The current focus on the immunobiology of aging leverages the Principal Investigator's extensive training in computer science, epigenomics, and aging biology. Ongoing work with collaborators at The Jackson Laboratory and The University of Connecticut Health Center has led to multiple discoveries related to the genomic signatures of human immune aging, and has yielded numerous questions that form the basis for the proposed research program, including: 1) Which regulatory programs and regulatory interactions are disrupted with aging in which immune cells? 2) How do men and women age differently? 3) What are the putative genomic/clinical/immunological markers of healthy aging? To address these questions, this research program will focus on developing machine learning and network mining algorithms that enable integration of data from diverse sources, since complex regulatory interactions and diverse regulatory elements cannot be inferred from a single data type. Fueled by these tools, it will investigate the dynamics of regulatory programs in blood- derived human immune cells associated with aging through collaborations with clinicians, immunologists, and chromatin scientists. This research will advance our understanding of how immune responses are transcriptionally regulated, will facilitate the design of interventions to boost immune health in elderly and diseased individuals, and will yield computational resources useful to diverse areas of genomic medicine. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The declining responsiveness of the aging immune system to combat infection is a major threat to the health, independence and survival of older adults. Here we propose to develop novel informatics tools and generate novel epigenomic data to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the human immune system associated with aging. !",Identification and Interpretation of Chromatin Changes Associated with the Aging of Human Immune Cells,9984421,R35GM124922,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologist', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'combat', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data integration', 'diverse data', 'epigenomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'healthy aging', 'immune health', 'informatics tool', 'learning network', 'men', 'next generation sequence data', 'novel', 'programs', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,464920,-0.032358108945976086
"Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The information content of DNA is not limited to the primary sequence (A, C, G, T), but is also conveyed by chemical modifications of individual bases. For example, DNA methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine (5mC), has been widely studied for its important regulatory roles in human development and diseases. In addition, the discovery of active demethylation of 5mC, mediated by TET enzymes, into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) revealed great insights into the dynamic nature of the human methylome and its close relevance to multiple human diseases. Beyond these chemical modifications to cytosine, recent studies by us and others discovered that N6-methyladenine (6mA), another form of methylation previously thought exclusively existing in bacteria and protozoa, also exists in eukaryotic genomes including the human genome. In addition to these epigenetic marks, different forms of DNA damages represent another category of DNA chemical modifications that are of important biological relevance. Although a few methods for mapping individual chemical modifications have been developed and some are widely used, it is usually hard for broad researchers to master every protocol to map each form of modification. While third- generation sequencing technologies support the direct detection of DNA modifications, they face fundamental challenges distinguishing among different forms of modifications. The objective of this project is to develop a novel technology for the direct mapping of multiple forms of DNA methylation and DNA damage events simultaneously. The core idea is that each form of nucleic acid modification has a unique signature in terms of their physical interaction with DNA polymerase, or nanopores in third-generation sequencing; and these signatures can be modeled by deep learning methods. We will develop this technology using multiple innovative strategies to address a few fundamental challenges, and then comprehensively evaluate the technology to facilitate broad applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Chemical DNA modifications are crucial components of human genome that controls many important biological processes in human development and human diseases. In this project, we will develop a novel technology for direct mapping of multiple and specific forms of DNA modifications, which will enable us and a large number of researchers to more effectively study the functions of DNA modifications in human genome. !",Direct Determination of Multiple Specific Forms of DNA Chemical Modifications in Human Genome,10267380,R56HG011095,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Cytosine', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Ploidies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protozoa', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Technology', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Thymine', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demethylation', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule real time sequencing']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R56,2020,233456,0.028050982123915033

"Defining humoral correlates of immunity against COVID-19 Since 2002, several coronaviruses have emerged able to cause severe respiratory disease, however no vaccine is available to prevent these rapidly spreading pathogens. Vaccine design has specifically lagged due to our lack of understanding of the correlates of immunity against these pathogens. Both cellular and humoral immune responses have been implicated in resolution of disease, but to date only the passive transfer of antibodies has been shown to confer complete protection in mice. Interestingly, the transfer of both “neutralizing” and non- neutralizing antibodies have shown protective efficacy, highlighting the role of multiple humoral mechanisms in limiting viral infection/spread. The precise mechanism of action of these antibodies that have the most profound impact on limiting disease is currently unclear, but if elucidated could provide critical insights for the development of effective vaccines against COVID-19 and other coronaviruses. Thus, here we aim to take a systematic approach to dissect and define both the polyclonal and monoclonal mechanisms by which antibodies confer protection against COVID-19. Specifically, samples from DNA- and adenovirus 26 (Ad26)- COVID-19 Spike protein (S) immunized animals, that will be challenged with COVID-19, will be comprehensively profiled using Systems Serology, to define the functional humoral immune responses linked to protection from infection/disease in mice, ferrets, and macaques. Machine learning modeling will be employed to discern key immune response features that translate usefully across these diverse animal contexts. Coupled to a novel systems-Fc-engineering approach, the COVID-19 CR3022 monoclonal antibody will be engineered to specifically define the Fc-effector functions that provide the greatest impact on limiting disease. Collectively, these studies will not only define correlates of immunity across vaccines and species, but also provide mechanistic insights into the precise mechanisms by which antibodies may confer protection in the context of future vaccines.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts.

"Mapping host-microbe-metabolite interactions in 3D to find diet-derived enhancers of immunity Project Summary Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem, and current drug pipelines are not keeping pace with the rise of antimicrobial resistance. An alternative strategy is to boost host immunity. An often overlooked side-effect of the vitamin and mineral supplementation projects of the 1940s is that these supplements greatly reduced infectious disease burden. Recent work has shown that further gains may be possible, especially in adding phytochemicals back to highly processed diets typically consumed in the United States. However, we lack a fundamental understanding of how these components are processed by the microbiome, and how diet-derived molecules, microbiome and host immune system work together to resist infectious disease. A key barrier preventing us from making these discoveries is that each individual assay (microbiome, host gene expression metabolome, dietary compounds) is expensive and highly multivariate. Three key insights that enable the current project are the miniaturization of DNA and RNA sequencing assays on advanced nanoliter- scale liquid handling robots, greatly reducing the cost, the combination of untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry on the same samples in high throughput to enable discovery of a much greater chemical space, and the ability to use explicitly spatial maps on multiple scales to integrate the dataset throughout the body and enable both visual analytics and deep learning approaches based on spatial data. These breakthroughs will provide a fundamentally new understanding of how dietary metabolites promote disease resistance, and will allow us to develop a new infrastructure to integrate results from many investigators in different laboratories studying various aspects of these systems. Additionally, the results will allow us to choose biomaterials and biomarkers in human subjects that provide maximum information about internal nutritional and immune status. Results will be tested against the NHANES and American Gut cohorts. The results of this project will therefore be: 3D maps of mouse models showing how the microbiome, diet, and host gene expression produce immunity; an infrastructure for creating and sharing these maps; and a preliminary test of whether the results extend to large human populations.

"Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes Project summary In contract to sexual organisms, the mechanisms of population genetics in bacteria are far less understood. Two fundamental aspects of bacterial population genetics remain sorely understudied: i) the impact of DNA exchange on the evolution of bacterial genomes and populations is largely unknown. ii) the prominence of adaptive evolution has not been comprehensively assessed in bacteria. Determining how recombination and adaptive evolution impact bacteria is key to understand the biology of these organisms and to develop relevant models of their evolution. Although bacteria reproduce clonally, there is increasing evidence that the vast majority of these organisms are capable of homologous recombination by exchanging pieces of DNA in a process similar to gene conversion in animals and plants. This process enhances microbial capacity to adapt to stresses or changing environments and the exchange of DNA between bacterial strains is a major concern for human health as exemplified by the transfer of virulence and antibiotic resistance genes. Despite the central role of this process, the rates and patterns of recombination remain unresolved in bacteria. The extent of recombination often varies greatly from one study to another and, as a result, the same bacterial species can be perceived as clonal in one study and highly recombining in another. In this project, we propose to re-evaluate the landscape of recombination rates and patterns along the genomes of hundreds of bacterial species. Using new methodological frameworks based on Approximate Bayesian Computation and Deep Learning, we will identify the factors shaping the variation in recombination rate across bacteria. We will also uncover recombination rate variation across bacterial chromosomes (i.e. hot spots and cold spots). Our rate estimates will also allow us to study how recombination drives the evolution of genomic architecture of bacteria, including turnover in gene content. Finally, we will quantify the impact of adaptive evolution in bacteria, which may be substantially larger than in other organisms due to large bacterial effective population sizes. We will also investigate the relationship between adaptation and recombination, and identify the genes/pathways responsible for adaptation. In summary, this study will evaluate the rates and patterns of recombination across hundreds of species, determine the factors driving the evolution of the recombination process, reveal the role of adaptive evolution in bacteria, and the interplay between recombination and adaptation. Project narrative Homologous recombination and adaptive evolution are key mechanisms driving bacterial adaptation to new environments and new treatments. The proposed study aims to apply new approaches to determine the rates and patterns of recombination across genomic data in order to identify the factors shaping the rates and landscapes of recombination as well as the impact of adaptive evolution on bacteria. Upon completion, this project will provide a global view of the interplay between recombination and adaptative evolution across hundreds of bacterial species.",Investigating the impact and patterns of homologous recombination and adaptive evolution on bacterial genomes,9968563,R01GM132137,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Chromosomes', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biology', 'Chromosomes', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Contracts', 'DNA', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evolution', 'Fibrinogen', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Conversion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Population Sizes', 'Process', 'Prokaryotic Cells', 'Recombinants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Spottings', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'base', 'deep learning', 'gene function', 'genome analysis', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'homologous recombination', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'novel strategies', 'resistance gene', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA GREENSBORO,R01,2020,294378,0.0014221002540064109
"HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS Project Summary Abstract Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to DNA and either activating or repressing target gene expression. While our understanding of how TFs bind DNA has grown rapidly, our understanding of how TFs activate transcription once they are bound has not kept pace. As a result, when we identify a mutation in a patient in a TF, if this mutation is in the DNA binding domain, we can sometimes predict if it will disrupt function; if the mutation is in the activation domain, we have no ability to predict its effects. To address this gap, I propose to study the amino acid composition of acidic activation domains using high-throughput assays and modern computational analyses. I have recently developed a high-throughput assay for measuring thousands of designed activation domain mutants in yeast. Here, I propose to develop a similar method in mammalian cell culture. In Aim 1, I propose an in-depth study of a few activation domains as a model for how genetic variation impacts TF function. In Aim 2, I propose a broad survey of human transcription factors to search for new activation domains. In the independent phase of this grant (R00), I propose 2 more aims to investigate the mechanisms how TFs activate target genes. In Aim 3, I will functional classify different type of activation domains and search for common features of each time. In Aim 4, I will link activation domains to cofactors and look for the features that predict activation.] This proposal will create a new layer of annotation for the human genome: all regions that are sufficient to serve as activation domains, create a new genome-scale method and deliver computational models for predicting activation domains from amino acid sequence. This award will support training in mammalian experimental systems and advanced machine learning analysis. Together these aims will support the long term goal of reading the regulatory genome by predicting gene expression from DNA sequence. Project Narrative Transcription factors are proteins that bind DNA and turn target genes ON or OFF. When we sequence a genome, we can identify which proteins are likely to be transcription factors, however we cannot predict whether these candidates will turn their targets ON or OFF. I propose to develop a tool to find all the transcription factors in the human genome that can turn ON target genes.",HIGH-THROUGHPUT FUNCTIONAL INTERROGATION OF MAMMALIAN ACTIVATION DOMAINS,9856466,K99GM131022,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Award', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase Transition', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reading', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Yeasts', 'activating transcription factor', 'cell type', 'cofactor', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging platform', 'in vivo', 'learning classifier', 'model building', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'rapid technique', 'recruit', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,99998,-0.05633338957137119
"Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development The need for improved and more universally protective influenza vaccines is well recognized. Central to efforts towards improvements is the development of animal models more predictive of the human response to immunization and/or infection. Indeed, this need has been highlighted by the NIAID Strategic Plan for a Universal Influenza Vaccine. While animal models may never be able to fully predict the human response, understanding their full strengths and weaknesses and identifying the optimal models for different purposes is a significant public health need and is the scientific premise behind our proposed objectives. These objectives, which are built upon our extensive use of influenza animal models, are to optimize animal modeling of immunologic imprinting, to improve vaccine efficacy testing, and to identify immune correlates of protection and boosting immune responses. Our overall goal is to provide superior preclinical models to support universal influenza vaccine development. We will achieve this goal through three complementary and interrelated specific aims, 1) optimal modeling of human serologic responses to repeat influenza antigen exposure in animal models; 2) improving the quantitative nature of the ferret influenza challenge model; and 3) defining serologic correlates of influenza virus induced clinical symptoms. Our ability to conduct these aims is supported through our participation in, and collaboration with, a recently NIAID-funded human infant cohort, the DIVINCI study. We will mirror the influenza antigen exposures of a selection of these infants in three animal models and compare immunologic data sets to identify which most accurately reflects the human response (Aim 1). This marriage of human and animal data sets and samples offers an innovative way forward and will provide a unique set of differentially primed animals with which to determine immune correlates of novel physiologic parameters of infection and immune responses (Aim 2) using original machine learning algorithms (Aim 3). Current models for influenza vaccine development suffer from poor predictability of the human response. Through an innovative combination of approaches that use data from longitudinal human cohorts, we intend to greatly enhance the reliability and value of these models in universal influenza vaccine testing.",Improving predictive capacity of models for universal influenza vaccine development,9950635,R01AI150745,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Cavia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Ferrets', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hamsters', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Information Systems', 'Lasso', 'Lung', 'Marriage', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Predictive Value', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Serological', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'Upper respiratory tract', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccine Production', 'Vaccines', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication', 'Whole Body Plethysmography', 'animal data', 'animal model development', 'cohort', 'efficacy testing', 'flexibility', 'human data', 'human model', 'imprint', 'improved', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse development', 'multitask', 'next generation', 'novel', 'preclinical evaluation', 'product development', 'research and development', 'response', 'safety study', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'universal vaccine', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,ST.

"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,9895377,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protein profiling', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2020,239725,0.01981769269001265
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America.

"Inferring gene regulatory circuitry from functional genomics data PROJECT SUMMARY It has long been known that methylation of genomic DNA correlates with gene expression. However, the structural mechanisms that underlie these observations remain obscure. In this project, we will pursue several innovative strategies for studying how methylation affects transcription factor (TF) binding. First, we will use Methyl-SELEX-seq – a novel experimental method developed in the previous cycle of this grant that uses barcoded mixtures of methylated and unmethylated DNA ligands – to create detailed maps of the effect of methylation on binding affinity for a broad panel of human transcription factors from various structural families. Second, we will perform detailed computational analyses and follow-up experiments to test the hypothesis that methylation causes local changes in DNA shape, which in turn modify TF binding affinity. We have shown that adding a methyl group in the major groove changes the geometry of the minor groove and enhances the electrostatic interaction between negative charges in the DNA minor groove and positively charged amino- acids in the TF. We will extend these analyses to other DNA modifications, as well as a wider range of DNA shape parameters and associated flexibility parameters. By building interpretable TF-DNA recognition models that integrate base, shape, and flexibility features using a powerful new machine learning framework developed in the previous funding cycle, we will make specific predictions regarding sequence and methylation readout mechanisms, and validate these using SELEX experiments with mutated TFs. To assess to what extent our quantitative models for binding to naked DNA built from SELEX data are predictive of binding to genomic DNA in the context of the living cell, we will perform detailed parallel analyses of SELEX and ChIP- seq data for Hox proteins and other TFs. Finally, to study the relationship between DNA binding and gene expression control in human cell lines, we will exploit Survey of Regulatory Elements (SuRE-seq), a novel massively parallel reporter assay that provides unique information about the autonomous transcriptional activity for each of >108 overlapping genomic fragments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epigenetic modifications of the human genome are known to play a key role in development and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. The main goal of this proposal is to develop and apply new experimental and computational tools for analyzing how the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA is influenced by cytosine methylation.

"Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Summary: Dissecting host-pathogen interactions through the lens of genomics Current investigation of mechanisms underlying many diseases relies on the acquisition of multi-dimensional genomics data. The utility of these data is, however, offset by the lag in development of tools and models to fully interrogate them. In the context of infectious diseases, such data contains molecular information including gene transcription, regulation, and variations from both the infecting pathogen and the host cell, providing a snapshot of the host and pathogen interactions (HPIs). These HPIs determine infection outcomes. For instance, when a pathogen evades, or evolves resistance to defensive host immunity via a multifaceted HPI, it can result in persisting infection, chronic inflammation, malignant transformation, and/or elevated mortality. Recent successes in overcoming immune-evasion of infected tumor cells with checkpoint inhibitors exemplifies the clinical gains that can be made by identifying and specifically targeting essential mechanisms of HPIs. Hence, precisely identifying new mode(s) of HPIs is critical for development of effective and personalized interventions. The molecular mechanisms of HPIs underpinning disease can be identified from genomics data. For example, information on whether a transcription factor (TF) regulates genes from either host or pathogen, or both, can be captured by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing of infected host cells. This means that integrative analysis of genome-scale data can provide a platform for large-scale and unbiased detection of often multi- dimensional and novel facets of HPIs in host cells. However, there is a lack of data mining tools and models to extract such information. More importantly, the available analysis tools typically focus on data from either the host or the pathogen and not on the interactions occurring between the two, excluding us from investigating the full HPI spectrum. Thus, novel methods to determine HPIs by simultaneously modeling both host and pathogen data are critical for understanding key cellular mechanisms and developing treatment strategies. My lab specializes in developing computational models to construct HPI maps and to experimentally validate them. As proof-of-principle, we produced a comprehensive HPI map from sequencing samples from large numbers of tumors caused by Epstein–Barr virus. This map delivered unprecedented insights, identifying novel viral integrations, mutations linked to viral reactivation and providing molecular classification of tumors expected to yield individualized cancer therapy. Therefore, my lab is uniquely positioned to uncover mechanistic insights from HPIs. Our program seeks to develop new models and machine learning tools to construct HPI maps in several diseases by focusing on the following major questions: 1) how do expression, integration, and mutational landscapes of host and pathogen affect pathogenesis of disease?; 2) what is the nature of physical HPIs and cross-regulation by major host and pathogen factors that modulate gene expression, such as TFs and RNA binding proteins?; 3) how do HPIs define molecular subtypes to guide personalized treatments? We expect to identify novel HPIs and provide systems-level understanding of mechanisms critical to cell biology. Narrative Understanding how host cells and pathogens interact is key to developing new and individualized therapeutics. Here, we will develop novel computational tools and models to analyze existing and newly generated high throughput data and construct multi-dimensional host pathogen interaction maps.

"An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in next generation–sequencing (NGS)-based molecular methods have illuminated the hierarchical organization of the genome and have shown that changes in the epigenome can promote or prevent the access of transcription factors (TFs) to specific DNA sequences, move genes between nuclear compartments, and build or remove the insulation between neighboring genomic regions. As changes in the epigenome and chromatin organization can derail precise transcriptional regulatory programs to change cell differentiation status or induce a pathological state, research in Dr. Li’s laboratory seeks to improve our ability to define and understand the impact of such changes across multiple layers of transcriptional regulation in the cell. The laboratory has effectively addressed the regulatory roles of DNA methylation in its previous and ongoing work and now extends its focus to hydroxymethylation. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), is a key epigenetic modification linked to transcriptional activation; however, 5hmC data and its genome properties have thus far been evaluated with limited integration of different genomic data types. Moreover, there is no integrative computational framework designed to interpret the functional role of 5hmC in the context of 5-methycytosine (5mC), enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, gene expression data, and DNA sequence information. This proposal will fill the growing need for user-friendly, interpretable, and extendable tools for mining 5hmC data toward laying a foundation for basic mechanistic studies of the epigenome and facilitate discovery of potential therapeutic targets in disease. Building on the investigator’s progress in revealing the dynamics of 5hmC and its impact on gene regulation, the proposal will now develop innovative computational tools for 5hmC data mining and data integration with other NGS datasets, with a focus on applying these tools to B cell differentiation, cancer, and embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation. Key goals over the next five years include developing a computational framework to mine short- and long-read sequencing data to answer the following questions: (1) How does 5hmC contribute to epigenetic heterogeneity? (2) How does 5hmC epigenetic heterogeneity contribute to transcriptome heterogeneity? (3) How do 5hmC levels and epigenetic heterogeneity communicate with histone modifications, enhancer activities, chromatin interactions, and chromatin organization? We will combine machine learning and network mining algorithms to enable knowledge discovery and data integration from diverse genomic data types. We will then harness the 5hmC data-mining framework to identify 5hmC patterns that correlate with ESC differentiation, B cell differentiation, and that contribute to the fitness advantage of cancer cells. This work is significant because it will be the first dissection of 5hmC’s contribution to local and long-range epigenetic heterogeneity and the first computational framework to uncover the cross-talk between DNA modifications and other transcriptional regulators via chromatin interaction data. Collectively, this work will yield a fuller picture of the molecular events that underlie fundamental changes in cell state and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Modifications of the genome that do not change the sequence of the DNA, called epigenetic modifications, can impact how genes are expressed and lead healthy cells into a disease state. Here we propose to develop computational tools to define how one type of epigenetic modification, called hydroxymethylation, impacts gene expression and ultimately cell behavior. These tools will be versatile and adaptable to any cell type of choice, enabling research into the molecular features of the genome that underlie both normal and pathological cell behaviors.",An Integrative Computational Framework for DNA Hydroxymethylation Data Mining and Interpretation,9986833,R35GM133562,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'B cell differentiation', 'Behavior', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Process', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'epigenome', 'fitness', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'next generation sequencing', 'prevent', 'programs', 'stem cell differentiation', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,JACKSON LABORATORY,R35,2020,472500,-0.03145030552568256
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,9888409,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,319844,-0.030678800047218534
"Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities ABSTRACT The gut microbiome has a tremendous impact on health and disease, actively contributing to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, cardiovascular diseases, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. We do not yet have the necessary tools to precisely probe these microbial communities, though such tools could unlock extensive benefits to human health. Elucidating the contributions of individual species or consortia of bacteria would provide a rational basis for understanding microbiota-controlled disease and lead to novel therapies. To carry out the fundamental research planned in this proposal, we will tackle three major problems: First, we will build the first set of molecular tools that effectively and precisely modulate the microbiome bacteria; second, we will analyze the multiscale dynamics of microbial communities; and third, we will construct an ingestible biosensor for real-time monitoring of microbiome populations. Although antibiotics and fecal transplants can reconfigure microbial consortia, they do not precisely target individual bacteria. Conversely, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have evolved to selectively attack pathogenic bacteria but do not target microbiome bacteria, constituting desirable scaffolds for molecular engineering and potential sources of microbiome-targeting agents. We will develop a new computational peptide design methodology, based on classical and hybrid-quantum mechanical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to create a groundbreaking assessment of the dynamical and emergent properties of AMPs. Chemical synthesis and large-scale screening will confirm predicted selectivity against microbiome species, and a machine learning workflow will connect sequences of individual peptides to their dynamics and activity. We will then apply the synthetic AMPs to interrogate the human microbiome by selectively removing species during bacterial consortia experiments, to be carried out in bioreactors, under regular or anaerobic conditions. We will pair our experiments with whole-cell metabolic network models, providing a systems biology perspective to the analysis of inter-species interactions. An integrated ingestible biosensing device will be developed to monitor the microbiome by electrochemically sensing unique biomarkers from gut microbes. This will provide the first real-time measurements of microbiome composition and will be integrated to our bioreactors for testing, to ultimately be used for in vivo tests. This work will build the first set of molecular and computational tools for microbiome engineering and will lay the foundation to address critical gaps in our understanding of the gut micro-environment, and of the contributions of gut bacteria to the etiology of disease. Grounded in our demonstrated expertise in synthetic biology, computer science, microbiology, and electrical engineering, this project will provide a computational- experimental framework for developing a peptide encyclopedia for the gut microbiome, in line with NIH's public health mission and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The gut microbiome plays roles in nutrition, immunity, metabolism, and several poorly understood neurological disorders. Suitable tools, however, do not yet exist for engineering the microbial communities that constitute the human microbiome. The proposed research introduces the first molecular tools to precisely understand the functions of microbiome communities in our health and disease in order to then delineate therapeutic interventions for diseases mediated by the gut microbiota, thereby addressing NIH's public health mission.",Combining chemical and computational tools for predictive models of microbiome communities,10029354,R35GM138201,"['Address', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioreactors', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Encyclopedias', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Role', 'Source', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'chemical synthesis', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'fundamental research', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'in vivo evaluation', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'molecular dynamics', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'predictive modeling', 'quantum', 'real time monitoring', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'targeted agent', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R35,2020,342713,0.0314512007915225
"Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects around 50% of the US population. Even though the CMV exists in a latent state in healthy individuals, it profoundly shapes the immune system. Recent studies suggest that the CMV infection alters the immune response to influenza vaccine. However, the exact effect of CMV on the efficacy of the influenza vaccine remains controversial. In addition, how CMV shapes the immune responses toward other vaccines are unknown. We hypothesize that latent CMV infection induces critical changes in the immune system, which alters the efficacy of multiple types of vaccines. The ImmPort database currently hosts 133 vaccine studies, covering 21 types of vaccines, creating an unprecedented opportunity for us to test our hypothesis. We will perform a comprehensive meta-analysis to test the relationship between CMV and vaccine efficacies, and will use state-of-art statistical models (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian Network) to identify the mechanism by which CMV alters the vaccine response. Leveraging the group's expertise in computational immunology and rich datasets on ImmPort, we will address the following aims. Aim1: Test the effect of CMV on influenza vaccine outcome. We will perform a meta-analysis of 60 influenza studies available on ImmPort to test the impact of CMV. We will quantify and standardize the efficacy of influenza vaccine across studies, which are measured by hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) assays before and after the vaccination. We will also determine the CMV infection status in subjects, either directly from serological tests or indirectly from immune- phenotyping data using cutting-edge machine learning tools. We will then test if CMV increases the response to influenza vaccine by analyzing data from all studies in a unified statistical framework while taking the heterogeneity between studies into account. Aim2: Bayesian network analysis of influenza vaccine response. We will harmonize multimodal immune-phenotyping data from the influenza vaccine studies, including transcriptomics data, cytometry data, and cytokine measurements. We will use state-of-art network analysis methods (e.g., Dynamic Bayesian network) to model the interplay between the immune components over time. Using the Bayesian network, we will investigate the mechanism by which CMV shapes the outcome of influenza vaccination. Aim3: Explore the effect of CMV infection on other vaccines. We will extend our analysis to vaccines other than influenza vaccine, (e.g., West Nile, Hepatitis B, yellow fever, malaria, and Tuberculosis). We will quantify the vaccine efficacy using assays specific to the vaccine type, such as Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) for the malaria vaccine and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test for the yellow fever vaccine. We will perform separate network analyses to characterize the relationship between CMV and the immune response of individual vaccines. We will then perform joint analysis across vaccine types to identify the common impact of CMV across vaccine types. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infectious diseases remain an urgent problem, resulting in an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide and more than 110,000 deaths in the United States annually, but the efficacy of vaccines against many infectious diseases remains suboptimal, including malaria, influenza, and dengue. To improve the vaccines, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the immune response toward vaccines. In this study, we investigate how cytomegalovirus affects the efficacy of multiple vaccines, providing valuable information for improving the design of vaccines.",Pan-vaccine Analysis to Test the Impact of Cytomegalovirus on Vaccine Efficacy,10026284,UH2AI153016,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections', 'Cytomegalovirus Vaccines', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatitis B', 'Herpesviridae', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serologic tests', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Latency', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'Yellow Fever Vaccine', 'cytokine', 'design', 'improved', 'individual response', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'malaria infection', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccine trial']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH2,2020,242126,-0.09246596501262104
"Single molecule studies of protein binding and aggregation The information of detailed molecular mechanisms of IDP binding is contained in binding pathways (binding transition paths) that are supposed to be heterogeneous as observed in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To probe and analyze diverse binding pathways, we have developed and used three-color FRET. By attaching two dyes to an IDP and the third dye to a binding partner, it is possible to detect conformational changes of the IDP and the interaction with the binding partner at the same time. Recently, we have developed fast three-color FRET using a single continuous-wave laser excitation and statistical analysis of photon trajectories in collaboration with Dr. Irina V. Gopich at LCP, which determines binding kinetics and all three FRET efficiencies between fluorophores (published in Nature Communications 2020).   We have applied this method to the investigation of diffusion-limited binding of an IDP, the N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) of p53, and one of its binding partners, the nuclear coactivator binding domain (NCBD) of CBP. Diffusion-limited association implies heterogeneous binding pathways because initial contacts must occur in a random fashion. Using three-color FRET, we have demonstrated that binding pathways are indeed highly heterogeneous. About half of the transitions follow a path involving strong non-native electrostatic interactions, resulting in a long transition time of several hundred microseconds. The remaining half follow more diverse paths characterized by weaker electrostatic interactions and much shorter transition path times. The chain flexibility and non-native interactions make diverse binding pathways possible, allowing disordered proteins to bind faster than folded proteins, whereas nonnative interactions slow the folding rate in protein folding (published in Science 2020).  In addition to disordered proteins, we have also studied diverse pathways of conformational changes during protein folding. Protein folding is a process by which proteins find their native three-dimensional structure spontaneously. Typically, naturally evolved proteins exhibit a smooth folding energy landscape for fast and efficient folding by avoiding unfavorable kinetic traps. However, depending on the selection pressures during evolution, the energy landscape can be different. We showed that the folding energy landscape of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) protease monomer is highly rugged and folding pathways are highly heterogeneous (published in Biophysical Journal 2019). The distribution of these pathways is sensitive to the mutations and fluorophore locations. The rugged energy landscape likely results from intrinsic pressures to maintain robust folding when the virus mutates frequently, which is essential for the selection and propagation of drug resistant mutants.  We have also developed various single-molecule fluorescence techniques including single-molecule FRET and fluorescence lifetime imaging and quantitative analysis methods based on deep-learning for studying oligomerization and aggregation of amyloid beta (Abeta) that is associated with Alzheimers disease. We found that the concentration of oligomers, including dimers, is extremely low and that the dimer is conformationally diverse. Aggregation to form fibrils is also highly heterogeneous in terms of the number of strands in a fibril, the elongation speed, and conformation of fibrils. This heterogeneity in all stages of aggregation explains diverse results of experimental studies of amyloid-beta. n/a",Single molecule studies of protein binding and aggregation,10250257,ZIADK075113,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biophysics', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Dyes', 'Electrostatics', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'HIV-1', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Nuclear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Photons', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transactivation', 'Virus', 'abeta accumulation', 'base', 'cell growth regulation', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'fluorophore', 'molecular dynamics', 'monomer', 'mutant', 'non-Native', 'pressure', 'protein aggregation', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'single molecule', 'single-molecule FRET', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIDDK,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DIABETES AND DIGESTIVE AND KIDNEY DISEASES,ZIA,2020,813248,-0.054499007434109896
"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility.

"Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort ABSTRACT  Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disease affecting the exocrine system, with hallmark symptoms of dry mouth and/or dry eyes caused by the dysfunction of salivary and/or lacrimal glands, respectively. While Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and other studies have increased our knowledge of genetic risk factors for SS, the disease etiology remains not well understood, and such risk factors have not been translatable to any immunological treatment options for SS. The NIH-NIDCR-funded Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) was established to improve the understanding, diagnosis and treatment of patients with SS by developing/validating standardized classification criteria for SS; and developing a rich biospecimen repository with clinical data to be used for future epidemiologic, pathogenesis, and genetic studies of SS.[1, 2] For this project, we will focus on genomic data and measures of the 2016 ACR-EULAR classification criteria, involving ocular, oral, and autoantibody manifestations. As shown in our previous work, the genetics of SS varies with ancestry; thus, we will cluster patients by both the criteria subphenotypes and genetic ancestry. We believe that accounting for disease heterogeneity in this way will enable us to more precisely identify disease pathways and mechanisms. Using previously secured funding, we are completing DNA methylation typing on LSGs in 373 SICCA patients and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on PBMCs of 86 SICCA patients who also have DNA methylation profiling. This data provides a unique opportunity for multi-omics analysis to determine correlates between LSG tissue epigenetics, peripheral blood cell-type distributions and cell-specific gene expression by SS subsets. First, using GWAS data and DNA methylation data from LSG biopsies, we will identify genetic and epigenetic modifications associated with subtypes of SS in SICCA patients. We will then examine the relationships between them by testing for genotype-specific methylation and expression, and utilizing mendelian randomization and causal inference testing to investigate causality between these measures. Second, we will analyze scRNAseq data to identify how cell types, states and cell- specific gene expression correlate with SS subtypes. Finally, we will integrate genetics, epigenetics, and transcriptomics to determine multi-omics profiles associated with SS subtypes. We will jointly model associated features from the genomic data to investigate causal pathways via correlation networks, conditional analysis, and machine learning. We anticipate that SS subtypes will exhibit specific relationships within the multi- omics data and that this will advance our understanding of SS disease processes, leading to better treatment targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our proposal leverages unique NIDCR-funded resources by utilizing existing infrastructure and data with high level expertise to better understand the pathogenesis of Sjögren's syndrome and identify new therapeutic pathways. We propose to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data recently generated on patients of the Sjögren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) biorepository/registry. We will identify genomic determinants of subtypes of SS derived from subphenotypes and genetic ancestry, which we believe will be more indicative of underlying biologic pathways and will lead to more appropriate genomic candidates for SS treatments.",Epigenetic and transcriptomic determinants of Sjogren's Syndrome subtypes utilizing data from the Sjogren's International Collaborative Clinical Alliance (SICCA) cohort,10041649,R03DE029800,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'American', 'Arthralgia', 'Autoantibodies', 'Biological', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cells', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Exanthema', 'Exhibits', 'Exocrine System', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Immunologics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Labial Salivary Gland', 'Laboratories', 'Lacrimal gland structure', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Salivary Gland Tissue', 'Salivary Glands', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Sjogren&apos', 's Syndrome', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'differential expression', 'disease heterogeneity', 'epigenome', 'eye dryness', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'methylation testing', 'monocyte', 'multiple omics', 'novel therapeutics', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'systemic autoimmune disease', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R03,2020,161500,-0.0006982072171945728
"Systems Biology Approach to Redefine Susceptibility Testing and Treatment of MDR Pathogens in the Context of Host Immunity   Project Summary    For something as complex and multifaceted as bacterial antibiotic resistance (AR), our drug evaluation  paradigm is strikingly narrow and homogenous: MIC/MBC testing in standardized bacteriologic media. We  have shown that this drug evaluation paradigm is inadequate, even misleading, as changes in the media  conditions of the procedure lead to dramatically different results. A more holistic definition of antibiotic therapy  that centers on understanding antibiotic activity in synergy with host innate immune factors such as cationic  antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), serum and phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils) reveals therapeutic options  unrecognized in standard testing. The proposed U01 program represents a groundbreaking approach to use  systems biology approaches and inform more effective antibiotic utilization in the context of host innate  immunity. We propose to: 1) build an iterative systems biology workflow that integrates multiple experimental  and computational approaches to give a comprehensive assessment of AR; and 2) apply this workflow to high  priority pathogens to systematically elucidate AR mechanisms and their condition­dependency. The iterative  workflow includes: (i) omics and physiological data generation.  Clinically isolated strains of the selected  pathogens will be grown under conventional testing (bacteriologic media) and more physiologic conditions  (tissue culture media, serum, and in presence of AMPs and neutrophils) to probe for advantageous gain of  activity.  The omics data types collected are: DNA resequencing, RNAseq, and metabolomics.  (ii)  Bioinformatics and data modeling analysis involves three approaches: big data analysis for data set  dimensionality and coarse grained variable dependencies assessment, genome­scale modeling for  mechanistic elucidation and analysis, and machine learning that uses AR­related metadata to classify the  overall biological functions. This analysis will lead to understanding of AR mechanisms.  (iii) Multi­scale  validation from animal models, to laboratory evolution, to cytology, to gene expression alteration, to structural  protein analysis of putative targets. The validation thus ranges from host behavior to atomistic detail of  ligand­target interactions. The iterative loop then closes, comparing computational prediction to experimental  outcomes. False­negative and false­positive predictions are then algorithmically analyzed by a hypothesis  generating family of algorithms that then makes suggestions about what conditions to use in the next iteration  of the loop.  The pathogens that we will focus on are methicillin­resistant ​Staphylococcus aureus ​(MRSA), the  carbapenem­resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) Klebsiella ​pneumoniae ​and ​Acinetobacter baumannii,​ and  Pseudomonas aeruginosa​. The team of investigators has made the foundational observations and led the  development of the technologies on which the iterative workflow is based. A multi­ and genome­scale methods  of systems biology fulfills requirements of RFA­AI­14­064 to which it responds.              Narrative    The current evaluation of antibiotic drug candidates in drug discovery and in clinical medicine is conducted in

"Successful Clinical Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This innovative integrated systems biology application seeks to delineate the complex host/pathogen interactions occurring at the alveolar level that lead to unsuccessful response to therapy in serious pneumonia, including serious viral pneumonia. To achieve this objective, we will leverage our unique access to alveolar fluid collected as part of routine clinical care in mechanically ventilated patients with suspected pneumonia in our medical intensive care unit. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid will be obtained serially from well characterized mechanically ventilated patients with serious viral or Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter bacterial pneumonias. Both of these CDC-designated serious hazard level bacterial pathogens have clinical failure rates as high as 50%. A robust clinical definition will allow comparison of both host and pathogen signatures associated with failure of therapy vs. success. These clinical specimens and extensive patient phenomics will anchor two mutually supportive and iterative research projects. Project One will deploy robust tools for flow sorting macrophage and lymphocyte subset populations, isolating RNA from these populations, and performing transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis to compare successful and unsuccessful host response. Project Two will focus on both specific pathogen genomic profiles associated with unsuccessful outcome and the differential microbiome response. Specific pathogen genomic profiles identified will be tested for causality in a unique humanized alveolar macrophage mouse model by the Technology Core. Changes in microbiome communities will be comprehensively assessed by shotgun deep sequencing to detect bacteriophage, other virus, and fungal DNA, in addition to bacterial. A Technical Core will perform cell sorting of BAL macrophage and lymphocyte subsets, RNA sequencing, and whole genome methylation, as well as perform the mouse pneumonia model studies. A Data Management and Bioinformatics Core will develop tools to reduce the dimensionality of these large comprehensive datasets, including the clinical phenomics, and provide them to the Modeling Core. The Modeling Core will then use an ecosystem-based approach to this complex adaptive system combined with unique machine learning tools and neural networks to generate biomarkers of host, pathogen and/or microbiome patterns predictive of successful pneumonia outcome. Predictive biomarkers developed in the Modeling Core will then be validated in a prospective confirmatory cohort of patients in whom analogous data will be generated. Biomarkers will also be tested for causality the mouse model. The Administrative Core will perform the outward- facing role of education and outreach to the community and sponsor, as well as regularly exchanging datasets, analytic tools, and specimens with NIH-sponsored/approved repository sites.

"Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to build mathematical models of human innate immune responses to the global pathogen influenza virus A (IAV). To ensure successful replication, viral pathogens must simultaneously hijack several components of the host cell machinery while either evading or disabling innate cellular defenses. The host genetic background and subsequent viral and host signaling interactions dictate disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to mortality. Recent studies of IAV in genetically diverse murine models confirm the critical role of genotype in host response and outcome. Both molecular targets as well as key proteins involved in IAV pathogenesis could be therapeutically exploited to attenuate or prevent disease. Thus, we construct models of the molecular networks driving early innate IAV response that can be used to model genetic effects. Our experimental system is human lung epithelium, the first-line of defense against and target of IAV.  Aim 1. Genetic predictions from the gene regulatory network (GRN) governing human epithelial IAV response. GRNs describe the control of gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). We showed that integrating ATAC-seq with RNA-seq improves GRN accuracy. To construct a dynamic GRN in our heterogeneous lung tissue model, we propose scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq measurements of IAV infection and IFNβ stimulation time courses. Our group recently discovered new mechanisms by which the IAV protein Ns1 drives promoter-independent transcriptional “read-through” and alters 3D-chromatin architecture. Thus, for modeling, we also measure genomic transcription initiation and promoter-capture Hi-C. Following experimental testing and GRN refinement, we will use a deep-learning model trained on DNA sequence and epigenetic data to provide inputs that enable dynamic GRN simulations for thousands of human genotypes. We will identify genetic risk loci and molecular mechanisms driving difference in gene expression responses across individuals.  Aim 2. Model the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and cellular signaling networks driving the innate immune response to IAV. We developed mutant influenza viruses, each encoding a FLAG-tagged viral protein, while maintaining virulence in vivo. We will use the mutant IAV to map host-virus PPIs in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung in vivo. Integrating with diverse ‘omics datasets, we will construct a molecular network model connecting virus-host PPIs through cellular signaling pathways to IAV-dependent TFs. We will test pathway reconstruction with epistasis mapping.  Completion of both aims will lead to a GRN spanning virus-host PPIs and cellular signaling to TF control of gene expression in an innate-immune cell type. Our experimental-computational design is widely applicable. This model, and its future adaptation to other cells, will help identify the genetic and molecular mechanisms driving diverse human IAV responses and the network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Human response to Influenza virus infection varies dramatically between individuals, from mildly symptomatic to death. We will systematically measure and model the innate immune response to IAV at the molecular network level: from host-virus protein-protein interactions through cellular signal transduction to changes in gene expression in human cells. The resulting mathematical model will help identify network vulnerabilities to be exploited for IAV therapy and help predict differences in IAV response in the human population.",Dynamic regulatory network models of human response to influenza virus,9950738,U01AI150748,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromatin', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza A virus', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon-beta', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Population', 'Prize', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Training', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Transcription Initiation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Proteins', 'Virulence', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immune response', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'cell type', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu', 'forest', 'global health', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human model', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'mathematical model', 'molecular modeling', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'network models', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk variant', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcription factor USF', 'transcription termination', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus genetics']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2020,1202266,-0.025817584461151982
"Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations ABSTRACT During normal development, aging, and diseases such as cancer, DNA damage due to endogenous and external factors, and repair defects result in accumulation of different types of somatic mutations including single nucleotide substitutions, small InDels, copy number alterations, translocations, and ploidy changes. While a vast majority of somatic mutations in the genome are not disease drivers, their patterns of genetic changes and associated context can provide insights into past exposure to mutagens, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair defects, and extent of genomic instability, which are important for understanding disease etiology, minimizing hazardous environmental exposure, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies such as immunotherapy. A number of mutation signatures have been identified based on local sequence contexts to address this need. But, mechanisms of DNA damage and repair preferences depend on both local sequence and epigenomic contexts, and it remains to be understood whether epigenomic contexts of emerging mutation signatures can provide critical, complementary etiological insights at a genome-wide scale, which are not apparent from sequence contexts alone. This is of fundamental importance, because (i) etiology of many of the emerging mutation signatures is currently unknown, (ii) DNA damage response and repair depends on tissue contexts, and defects in core DNA repair genes often result in cancer development in tissue-specific manner, and (iii) differences in the extent of DNA damage and repair between stem and differentiated cells within the same tissues have consequences for aging and disease incidence rates. Built logically on our previous works, we propose to develop computational approaches to determine the impact of epigenomic contexts on the patterns of somatic mutations within and across tissue types, and validate computational predictions using targeted experiments. In Aim-1, we will develop an epigenomic context preference map for emerging mutation signatures. In Aim-2, we will determine the basis of tissue-dependent differences in mutation profiles attributed to DNA repair defects. In Aim-3, we will predict the extent of cell lineage-dependent patterns of mutation accumulation from the mutational landscape of terminal cells. I am currently an early stage investigator, and the proposal is aligned with my long-term goal to identify fundamental principles of mutability and evolvability of somatic genomes. Our project will deliver novel resources and knowledge for addressing questions regarding genomic integrity during development and aging, and diseases such as cancer. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project will use computational biology approaches to determine epigenomic context preference for somatic mutations, and use that to infer tissue-dependent changes in mutation patterns. Our results will provide fundamental insights into aspects of genome maintenance, which is important for advancing our understanding of cancer etiology, reducing exposure to mutagenic factors, and also predicting efficacy of emerging treatment strategies. !",Computational approaches for identifying epigenomic contexts of somatic mutations,9902467,R01GM129066,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Relapse', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Gene', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutagens', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Ploidies', 'Point Mutation', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'computer framework', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'genome integrity', 'genome-wide', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'repaired', 'response', 'stem', 'stem cells', 'tissue stem cells', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS -CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY,R01,2020,324350,-0.0012744063444580106
"Application of Genomic Approaches to Bacterial Pathogenesis and Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance MDR gram-negative bacterial undergo selection and evolution in the natural context of antibiotic treatment in a human host, though important features of host context are often not included in studies of AMR.  Additionally, other features underlying bacterial resilience in the context of infection  including the ability to evade host defenses  often synergize with specific AMR mechanisms and consequently have linked evolutionary relationships. Our work employs a systems biology approach to study the evolutionary mechanisms by which resistance  defined broadly to include resistance to antibiotics and to host defenses - emerges in the natural context of host infection. Current work is organized around three specific projects:   1. Mechanisms by which MMR deficiencies can facilitate the rapid evolution of resistance to antibiotics in P. aeruginosa.  P. aeruginosa is an important pathogen responsible for significant morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients, and the mechanisms underlying the emergence of MDR P. aeruginosa phenotypes within patients receiving antibiotic therapy is critical to developing approaches to treat these infections. We previously demonstrated that evolved mismatch repair (MMR) deficiencies may be exploited by P. aeruginosa to facilitate rapid acquisition of mutations mediating resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), a new class of broad-spectrum beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor in the context of acute infection over a period of days.  Highly parallel in vitro directed evolution experiments were performed with isogenic strains containing WT and transposon-inactivated MutS to study the detailed mechanisms by which CZA resistance evolves in MMR-deficient strains.  Current steps include high throughput whole genome sequencing of these isolates in combination with RNA-seq to evaluate the genomic and transcriptional landscapes underlying the evolution of CZA resistance.  Functional characterization of identified novel targets potentially involved in CZA resistance is also underway.  2. Comprehensive whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis of a historical collection of clinical Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) clinical isolates spanning decades.  Members of the BFG are important constituents of the human microbiota, but they can also behave as significant pathogens in certain contexts. Historically, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in BFG isolates were largely predictable, allowing effective use of empiric treatment regimens.  Alarming increases in AMR have recently necessitated reconsideration of empiric strategies. To understand the genomic basis of these AMR trends, we have initiated an effort to sequence a large group of clinical BFG isolates spanning a period of five decades. This work included short read sequencing and construction of >400 genomes and initial annotation and analysis of antimicrobial resistance elements.  Additionally, comprehensive phenotypic characterization of AMR in the set was undertaken to allow detailed genotype-phenotype analysis.  3. Study of genomic evolution of MDR Bordetella hinzii infection in an immunocompromised host.  In this work, we have characterized the genomic mechanisms driving adaptive evolution in the emerging pathogen Bordetella hinzii following presumptive zoonotic transfer from an animal reservoir to a human host with interleukin-12 receptor deficiency. Initial work involved whole genome sequencing of 24 B. hinzii isolates cultured from blood and stool over a period of 45 months, which revealed a single clonal lineage that had undergone extensive within-host genetic change reflected in a remarkable degree of observed phenotypic diversity. Analysis demonstrated that the majority of isolates shared an ancestral mutation in the DNA Polymerase III Epsilon-subunit Exo I active site, resulting in a proofreading deficiency. Within these proofreading-deficient lineages, secondary compound hypermutators with complex alterations in mutational spectra emerged and dominated clinical cultures for a period of 12 months, demonstrating their superior in vivo fitness. Statistical signatures of mutational targeting were present in multiple sequential enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and gluconeogenesis pathways, suggesting specialized metabolic adaptation to the host environment. Current work is underway to characterize the transcriptional landscape of these adaptive changes.   Work completed during FY 2020 included:  1.  The mechanisms by which mismatch repair deficiencies can facilitate the rapid emergence of resistance to antibiotics in P. aeruginosa.  Work completed in 2020 included whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis of >300 P. aeruginosa isolates generated through an in vitro adaptive evolution study of MMR-deficient lineages. This work allowed mapping of detailed evolutionary trajectories of lineages at single mutation resolution as resistance to CZA evolved.  The main findings of this work are that the MMR deficient hypermutators evolved CZA resistance through distinct evolutionary pathways that are apparently not available to wild type isogenic isolates. These pathways involved mutations in a set of novel genes not previously known to be associated with resistance to CZA or to other beta lactams. Work is currently underway to characterize the transcriptomes of the evolved CZA-resistant isolates to gain insight into the contribution of changes in gene expression to the resistance phenotype. Functional studies of novel targets identified by this work is also underway.  2. Comprehensive whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis of a historical collection of clinical Bacteroides fragilis group (BFG) clinical isolates spanning decades.  Work completed during the 2020 fiscal year focused on long-read nanopore-based sequencing of BFG genomes to allow assembly of complete end-to-end contiguous genomes and plasmids.  This work was undertaken after initial analysis of the short-read assemblies indicated the importance of mobile genetic elements and plasmids in carrying resistance and virulence elements.  >200 isolates have been sequenced with nanopore technology and genomes and plasmids assembled.  Detailed phylogenetic reconstruction and mapping of the mobilome and AMR elements in both genome and plasmids is underway.  Additionally, machine learning approaches have been employed to assist in identification of plasmid sequences.  3. Study of genomic evolution of MDR Bordetella hinzii infection in an immunocompromised host.  Work completed during the FY 2020 focused on evaluating the transcriptional landscape in the set of serial isolates collected over the course of 45 months complement the genomic sequencing and analysis that had been previously performed. The goal of this work was to understand how adaptive mutations selected during the course of infection may reprogram networks controlling gene expression, facilitating evolution of AMR and host adaptation.  >180 transcriptomes were sequenced and constructed for the set of isolates with replicates at different points in the growth phase, allowing detailed analysis of the transcriptional landscape in these host-adapted MDR isolates. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of transcriptomes grouped proofreading-deficient isolates separately from proofreading-intact lineages and revealed differential expression among (1) genes involved in oxidative stress response, 8-oxoguanine deaminase, and glutathione synthesis and transport systems; (2) the fliA-dependent flagellar regulon; and (3) operons involved in synthesis of 1-4 branched alpha glucans and N-linked protein glycosylation. Further analysis will explore the functional consequences of these changes. n/a",Application of Genomic Approaches to Bacterial Pathogenesis and Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Resistance,10272245,ZIAAI001249,"['Active Sites', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Blood', 'Bordetella', 'Ceftazidime', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA Polymerase III', 'Deaminase', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evolution', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucans', 'Gluconeogenesis', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Mismatch Repair Deficiency', 'Mobile Genetic Elements', 'Modern Medicine', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Operon', 'Organism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Glycosylation', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Public Health', 'Regulon', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'acute infection', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'beta-Lactams', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'differential expression', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human microbiota', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interleukin-12 receptor', 'link protein', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'whole genome']",NIAID,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES,ZIA,2020,1967333,-0.0013664508880566046
"Molecular Allergy I. Origins of Allergic Disease  Over 100 million people worldwide suffer from birch pollen allergy. However, identification of molecular determinants driving the allergic responses to Bet v 1, the major birch pollen allergen, remains elusive. In collaboration with a group in Salzburg, Austria, we examined the pollen microbiota and investigated the allergenicity of Bet v 1 upon interaction with pollen-derived compounds.  Sensitization to Bet v 1 is induced by an as-yet-undetermined pollen compound or mechanism in the pollen environment. These data suggest that sensitization is not exclusively linked to the intrinsic properties of individual proteins.  In our future studies we will continue to investigate the birch pollen metabalome for evidence of small molecules that skew the immune response to allergy.  Researchers in Salzburg will identify pollen fractions with intrinsic allergencity and provide them to NIEHS for analysis.  The metabolome of pollens is also potentially useful in identifying pollen taxa. The daily pollen forecast provides crucial information for allergic patients to avoid exposure to specific pollen.  Pollen counts are typically measured with air samplers and analyzed with microscopy by trained experts.  In contrast, we evaluated the effectiveness of identifying the component pollens using the metabolites extracted from an air-sampled pollen mixture. Our study demonstrated that NMR spectra of air-sampled pollen extracts can be used in an automated fashion to provide taxa and type-specific measures of the daily pollen count using deep learning algorithms.    II.  Characterization of Allergens  A common general question about allergens is whether or not there are common properties. Several anecdotal studies have suggested that abundance in the allergic source, and protein stability are common among allergens.  In our study we utilized 2 omics-based methods to address this question with statistical rigor. First we studied RNA-seq data from cockroaches, birch pollen, grass pollen, and ragweed pollen to conclude that allergens are among the most highly expressed proteins.  Second, we used a mass spectrometry based approach to measure the stability of many proteins from these sources.  When we combined the data with previous studies on the dust mite proteome, we could concluded that allergens were among the most stable and highly expressed from their natural sources.  The important implications of this are in the design of therapies.  The data suggests that destabilized allergens as therapeutics would be less likely to generate the dangerous allergic reactions, and hopefully promote tolerant responses.   Western blots and mass spectrometry were used to show the presence of the LS in peanut and walnut seeds. The NMR Structure of the Ara h 1 LS was determined and the IgE binding sites were modeled on this structure. The epitopes with the highest degree of IgE binding were clustered within regions that were near cysteine residues. Of the patients tested, 96% showed IgE binding to those epitopes even if they recognized no other epitopes in the Ara h 1 LS. The NMR structure showed 4 of the cysteine residues are disulfide bonded and hold together two parallel alpha helices.  IgE binding is shown to be located at the junction of the c-terminal region of the alpha helices and the beginning of each flexible loop.  The results indicate that cysteine residues known to confer high structural stability to allergens may also coincide with areas of increased IgE binding frequency and intensity in Ara h 1 LS. The leader sequence contain multiple immunodominant epitopes and may be important in cross-reactivity and nut allergy. At NIEHS we continue to characterize more leader sequence allergens from walnut, peanut, and cashew to better understand patient cross-reactivity.  The cockroach allergen Bla g 1 is known to bind hydrophobic ligands, but why the protein is an important allergen is unknown.  We investigated a homolog of Bla g 1 from mosquitos called AZ1.  This protein is upregulated in mosquitos following a blood feed, and is upregulated in response to viral infections.  We have discovered that AZ1 can facilitate red blood cell lysis, and blocks infections of flaviviruses.  The common mechanism of action is a lipid exchange, whereby AZ1 loaded with fatty acids will strip a PC molecule from either a red blood cell, or an enveloped virus and deliver the fatty acid, destabilizing the target membrane.  This has important implications as a possible broad spectrum anti-viral agent.  In returning to the question of Bla g 1 related allergy, lung surfactant also contains a high concentration of PC.  Therefore we propose in the future to investigate if the lipid exchange properties of Bla g 1, facilitate lung damage that encourages allergic disease, or asthma exacerbations.   III. Adaptive Immune response  The defining characteristic of allergy is the generation of IgE antibodies, which leads to patient symptoms.  We wish to probe more fundamental properties of the antibody response.  It is suggested that by better understanding and characterizing the antibodies of all types new treatment modalities, or safer therapies can be developed.  Previously, we determined the first structure of the major peanut allergen Ara h 2.  Ara h 2 is recognized by more than 90% of peanut allergic patients and sensitivity to Ara h 2 is measurable risk factor for peanut induced anaphylaxis.  We have initiated a collaboration with researchers at Harvard University who have been studying the antibody production of peanut allergic patients in response to oral immunotherapy.  By isolating B-cells from the patients and sequencing immunoglobulin genes, they found evidence that separate patients were honing in on similar regions of Ara h 2.  We have received 5 of these antibody clones and are working to determine structures of antibody fragments in complex with Ara h 2.  So far, we tested the production of all 5, and have scaled up production.  The epitope information derived from these complexes will be useful in understanding the targets of the adaptive immune response of patients during peanut immunotherapy.  Directly examining human IgE in complex an allergen is technically challenging for a number of reasons.  First of all, the memory cells that make IgE are extremely rare in sera.  Scott Smith at Vanderbilt University has recently developed a technique to clone these rare cells and produce full length human IgE.  We have acquired 4 human monoclonal IgE antibodies against the major dust mite allergen Der p 2 to study as a collaborative project.  In the past year we have been measuring the interactions of the human IgE with Der p 2 via NMR technologies.  We hope that this pioneering technique could be generalized to study the response to other allergens, and may be applicable to other antibody types besides IgE.  The results will help us better understand the human immune response to allergens like Der p 2 with a hope using the information to design hypo-allergens that will improve allergy immunotherapy, better known as allergy-shots.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,-0.024899094564942336
"Regulatory and epigenetic landscapes in biological discovery, diagnostics and disease mechanisms Development of methods and biomarkers for blood-based detection of ovarian cancer The Elnitski lab previously reported the first methylation biomarker, ZNF154, as having pan/multi-cancer relevance (Sanchez-Vega et al. 2013) and showed that it could discriminate tumor from normal samples in simulations of dilute blood-based analysis of circulating tumor DNA (Margolin et al. 2014). Over the past several years, I have developed diagnostic markers and assessment methods that use DNA methylation at the ZNF154 locus to detect a myriad of epithelial cancers from patient plasma samples (Miller et al., manuscript submitted). Our semi-quantitative PCR assay uses melting curve temperatures to assess DNA methylation in amplified products (Miller et al. 2020, in press). The test is highly sensitive and specific for circulating tumor DNA and detects tumor DNA in plasma samples from ovarian cancer patients. As a biomarker, ZNF154 detects both serous and endometrioid subtypes of late stage ovarian cancer making it better than the current gold-standard biomarker, protein antigen CA-125. Moreover, using these complementary biomarkers in tandem for ovarian cancer screening may be a promising, more sensitive approach than can be achieved with either marker alone.  Profiling epigenetic features in up to 20 solid human epithelial cancer types To potentially improve cancer treatment efficacy, I previously sought to identify attributes that subdivide tumors into more homogeneous subsets using their epigenetic landscape profiles, in contrast to classification approaches that utilize mutational signatures or gene expression patterns. Building a computational approach allowed my group to demonstrate that the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) is present in 14 distinct cancer types from TCGA (the Cancer Genome Atlas) and 23 cancer cell lines (Sanchez-Vega et al. 2015). My lab also published the first report of a CIMP in ovarian endometrioid tumors, which showed consistency with altered DNA methylation seen in uterine endometrioid tumors (Kolbe et al. 2012).  We have shown that CIMP tumors from different cancers have shared biological pathways and may have a common underlying etiology (Miller at el. 2016). For example, my lab identified similarities and differences among CIMP tumors from esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas (Sanchez-Vega et al. 2017), which further addresses how aberrant methylation may occur in multiple tumor types. In further exploration of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, my work demonstrated that associations between cancer methylomes in 18 cancer types and somatic driver mutations illustrate the relationships between the epigenome and the genome in cancers (Chen et al. 2017). Using principal component analyses of methylation-mutation associations applied at the CpG (i.e., nucleotide) level, my labs work showed that genome-wide patterns of aberrant hypomethylation or hypermethylation were associated with a small number of somatic mutations in specific cancer types, suggesting global regulation. In contrast, site-specific methylation changes were associated with  an extensive number of mutated driver genes, suggesting local regulation. This year we expanded on our previous findings by showing that DNA methylation patterns in tumor genomes are associated with distinct isoform expression patterns predictive of sites of promoter repression, intragenic exon inclusion, and 3-terminal exon inclusion (Chen and Elnitski 2019). Our discovery of these relationships allows for the interpretation of which mRNA isoform is expressed in a tumor based on the analysis of the epigenome. Profiling epigenetic features in human populations The gold standard used to detect DNA methylation, bisulfite conversion, can result in data ambiguity or interpretation errors caused by polymorphisms at CpG methylation sites. We developed the algorithm MethylToSNP, which detects characteristic patterns of nucleotides that are likely to be confounded by polymorphisms (Goncearenco et al. 2020a), in the absence of corroborating genotype data. Using this tool, we distinguished altered DNA methylation indicative of SNP sites from samples of YRI (Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria), CEPH (European descent), and KhoeSan (Southern African) populations. Furthermore, in these populations we identified uncharacterized polymorphisms and determined locations in the genome that are affected by altered methylation or sequence polymorphisms, including CTCF sites and enhancers. Similarly, I have also worked to develop new analysis tools to assess methylation enrichment of ChIP-seq data and integrate it with other types of genome-wide data (Lichtenberg et al. 2017). 	To address the diversity of DNA methylation in individuals living in distinct environments, my lab compared the epigenomes of KhoeSan individuals from the Kalahari Desert to individuals living in similar geographical locations, but from within industrialized societies of Bantu speaking individuals (Goncearenco et al. 2020b). Between these populations, our analysis identified more than 10,000 differentially methylated sites. The top 5% of differentially methylated sites distinguished the KhoeSan samples from various ethnic groups around the world, even after the data was cleaned for any confounding artifacts. We examined the sites of altered methylation across the KhoeSan genomes (in enhancers, gene bodies, and CpG shores and shelves) and found significant underrepresentation in the expected number of changes, suggesting the presence of selective pressure maintaining the integrity of the epigenetic landscape. Our discoveries about the Kalahari Desert KhoeSan epigenome contribute to the greater understanding of human genome diversity. Insights to mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in the human genome Altered regulation of enhancers can occur through DNA methylation. Our recent study (Chen et al. 2018) on 14 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder found neuroanatomic and epigenetic differences between the siblings. Despite a lack of causal gene mutations, the ADHD-affected twins had a significantly smaller volume in the striatum and thalamus and a trend toward a larger cerebellum. Our analyses found no causal germline mutations, indels, or deletions that would explain the disparate results. However, the affected twins showed significant differences in DNA methylation patterns associated with some enhancer regions of genes expressed in the altered brain anatomical structures. These findings are consistent with the idea that subtle changes, such as the loss or alteration of enhancer elements in the genome, may be associated with discrete neuroanatomical anomalies.  In addition to enhancer elements, noncoding regions of the genome also carry repressive functions. Our research examined characteristics of repressive elements and trained a multivariate model of silencer elements. We validated our model results with expression-based experiments. With this combined approach we showed a statistically significant loss of gene expression was attributed to our candidate silencers (Huang et al. 2019).  Finally, splicing is an important post-transcriptional regulatory process in gene expression. Using mutation data, my lab predicted mutations that affect splicing as part of the CAGI (Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation) competition. We used a machine learning classifier and accurately identified mutations that cause aberrant mRNA splicing (Gotea et al. 2019). We also addressed mRNA splicing fidelity by building a computational pipeline to identify factors that suppress latent splicing in intronic regions. This mechanism is fundamental to all genes in the human genome, by preventing the incorporation of premature stop codons into open reading frames (manuscript in preparation). n/a","Regulatory and epigenetic landscapes in biological discovery, diagnostics and disease mechanisms",10267094,ZIAHG200323,"['Aberrant DNA Methylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Colorectal Adenocarcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Endometrioid Tumor', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Neoplasms', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Gastric Adenocarcinoma', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Enhancer Element', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Hypermethylation', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Kalahari', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nigeria', 'Nonsense Codon', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleotides', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Ovarian Endometrioid Tumor', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Serous', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Solid', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Silencer Elements', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Uterus', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer genome', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'causal variant', 'computational pipelines', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'driver mutation', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'melting', 'method development', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'promoter', 'response', 'simulation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumorigenesis']",NHGRI,NATIONAL HUMAN GENOME RESEARCH INSTITUTE,ZIA,2020,1895649,0.013684926449972318
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity Given the growing body of evidence that many (if not the vast majority) of chronic, non-communicable disease have their origins in fetal life, understanding the in utero factors that impact fetal metabolism and development are among the most important public health issues of our time. During the initial grant period, we generated and published considerable data which (together with others work) collectively suggest that fetal (re)programming of metabolic and developmental gene expression pathways occur via stable modification of not only the epigenome, but the metagenome (e.g., the microbial community genetic repertoire). In the current renewal, we propose a series of experiments that will considerably advance these findings.  Why study the microbiome in our non-human primate model? Employing our non-human primate model, we were the first to demonstrate that a high fat diet, and not obesity per se, drives both maternal and offspring microbial dysbiosis. For several years we have developed and employed metagenomics to characterize the early human developmental microbiome, and observed variation in its community membership and their function by virtue of multiple factors. However, given the inherent confounding of human cohorts, it remains unknown what the relative impact of maternal diet is on the early offspring microbiome, and whether this is driven by host epigenomic modifications. Moreover, how this leads to lifelong metabolic disease is unknown.  Based on our published and preliminary data from the initial grant period, our central hypothesis is that under conditions of maternal high fat diet exposure in gestation and lactation, the offspring hepatic and hypothalamic epigenome and the establishing microbiome undergo a series of highly predictive modifications. These modifications result in meaningful functional alterations to the offspring metabolome as well as transcriptome, resulting in both metabolic disturbances as well as behavioral modifications. While these offspring modifications are not readily modifiable with an improved diet post-weaning, reversion of the dams onto control diet just prior to pregnancy is largely restorative to her offspring. In order to prove this hypothesis, we will execute four essential aims in our primate cohort. The net result of the completion of these aims will be to first establish the conserved alterations to the fetal and juvenile gut and oral microbiome, alongside full spectral metabolomics, to identify the stable and lasting metabolic (both host and bacterial) footprint of maternal high fat diet exposure. By integrating our existing epigenomics data with the derived metagenomics data, we will be able predict how these microbiome and metabolome variations in turn influence fetal and offspring metabolic outcomes and phenotypic traits. After having spent over a decade establishing and molecular characterizing the current NHP model, we are uniquely poised to now undertake complex integration of our derived unique data sets in studies which are scientifically rigorous, feasible, justifiable, and of likely long-term significance and high translational impact. Over the last decade have developed a non-human primate model of obesity, now in its ninth year, to study the root molecular causes rendering risk of offspring metabolic disease following maternal high fat diet exposure. In the first period of this grant, we have shown that it is maternal high fat diet (HFD) consumption (rather than maternal obesity per se) which drives fetal metabolic reprogramming, and concomitantly modifies the fetal histone code as well as persistent alterations to the offspring microbiome as far out as three years of age, and note that the ensuant dysbiosis is not corrected with a healthy post-weaning diet. As a result of this work, we are now uniquely poised to apply metagenomics with advanced analytical approaches to decipher the molecular means by which the primate epigenome and its metagenome are modified by a maternal HFD, and how these changes result in lifelong risk of metabolic disease in the offspring.",Conserved Fetal Epigenomic and Metagenomic Signatures in a Primate Model of Maternal Obesity,9991796,R01DK089201,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diet', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fetus', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Hepatic', 'High Fat Diet', 'Histone Code', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Individual', 'Lactation', 'Life', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolism', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nucleotides', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phenotypic Sex', 'Plant Roots', 'Pregnancy', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'dysbiosis', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'genomic variation', 'gut microbiome', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in utero', 'insight', 'maternal condition', 'maternal microbiome', 'maternal obesity', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'mother nutrition', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'oral microbiome', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning', 'validation studies', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,645963,0.019247856567143447
"Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities, evidenced by their short healthy life expectancy and high all-cause and cancer mortality rates. Reasons for NatHW’s health disparities likely involve a combination of causes, including genetic susceptibility, individual and contextual socioeconomic status (SES), obesity and related lifestyle factors, smoking, healthcare access and quality, and the environment. The multifactorial basis of disparities requires an array of information and integrative approaches in research. Herein, we propose to use epigenetic biomarkers, known to reflect and mediate the combined effects of some of the genetic and environmental stressors, to enhance our mechanistic understanding of NatHW’s disparities in key carcinogenic metabolic traits. We will base the study in the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC), which is following the largest number of otherwise understudied Native Hawaiians (~7,850 women, ~6,120 men), as well as >201,000 older adults of mainly four other ethnicities (African American, Japanese American, Latino, white) since 1993-1996 with comprehensive characterization. Research to date indicates that there are significant sex and racial/ethnic differences in the human DNA methylome and in DNA methylation age (DNAm-age) acceleration. Thus, to enable an initial study in the MEC of leukocyte DNA methylation as a likely mediator of NatHW’s health disparities, we request a supplement to the MEC grant (U01 CA164973) in response to NOT-OD-20-048. We will analyze the archived leukocyte DNA samples in the Adiposity Phenotype Study (APS), which is a cross-sectional subset of the MEC, using the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC bead chips. This will allow us to compare genome-wide methylation patterns and DNAm-age parameters in 140 NatHW and 140 white women, aged 60-77 years at the time of blood collection. We plan to (Aim 1) compare the DNA methylation patterns by constructing a DNA methylation score (DNAm- score) for NatHW vs. white women using penalized logistic regression of ethnicity on methylation at CpGs, adjusted for % Native Hawaiian genetic ancestry. Based on the selected differentially methylated genes, we will infer the biological functions in pathway analysis. We hypothesize that we will discover a DNA methylation signature and accelerated DNAm-age for NatHW vs. white women. We will then (Aim 2) quantify the proportion of the excess metabolic risk in NatHW compared to white women, namely higher insulin, triglycerides, visceral fat, and liver fat, respectively, mediated through the DNA methylome, based on the DNAm-score and DNAm- age. Finally, we will (Aim 3) identify behavioral and environmental determinants of the DNAm-score or DNAm- age among the wealth of data in the MEC-APS (adulthood weight gain, total body fat, lifetime smoking, diet quality, alcohol and meat intake, physical in/activity, sleep hours, and individual and neighborhood SES). This study addresses the goal of the U3 supplement and the MEC U01 grant and may yield important insight into the mechanisms of the disparities in NatHW. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE Native Hawaiian women (NatHW) experience substantial health disparities compared to women of other races/ethnicities. We propose to compare blood epigenetics, the external changes to DNA induced by both genetic and environmental influences, in NatHW and white women. This analysis nested in a large, long-term follow-up study will allow us to understand better which lifestyle and environmental risk factors, to what extent and for which physiologic functions increase the disease-causing metabolic risk in NatHW through epigenetics.",Understanding Ethnic Differences in Cancer: The Multiethnic Cohort Study - DNA Methylation Supplement,10091327,U01CA164973,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '21 year old', 'Aborigine', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hepatocarcinogenesis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'Japanese American', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Latino', 'Leukocytes', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mammary Gland Parenchyma', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Native Hawaiian', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polynesian', 'Processed Meats', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sleep', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Strategic Planning', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visceral', 'Visceral fat', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'aged', 'base', 'bead chip', 'carcinogenicity', 'chronic liver disease', 'disadvantaged population', 'environmental stressor', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'ethnic difference', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'genome wide association study', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'health care availability', 'health care quality', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'human DNA', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'liver function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'mortality', 'promoter', 'racial and ethnic', 'random forest', 'response', 'sex', 'trait']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,U01,2020,232505,0.017267755381981602
"Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations that began in the 1950's and continues today. Living on farms, avoiding antibiotics, vaginal delivery, and other environmental factors leading to greater diversity in the microbiome have been associated with a major reduction in the risk of atopic diseases. Understanding the development of the immune system in populations at low risk for allergy compared to high-risk populations, developing biomarkers for “protective” immune development, and assessing immune responses to the microbiome are fundamental for designing and assessing future interventions. In this proposal, we will compare the Old Order Mennonites (OOM) with a very low risk for food allergies (<1%), other allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome (e.g. growing up on a farm, consumption of raw milk, large families, home deliveries, low rate of antibiotic use), and neonates born to families with food-allergic children with a very high risk for developing atopic diseases, e.g. a 15-20% risk of food allergy in the first year of life. We hypothesize that accelerated development of IgA mucosal immunity will be a biomarker for “protective” immune development. Abundant IgA-coated fecal bacteria are seen in early life and data from animal models indicate the importance of microbial diversity in the induction of this secretory IgA. Early studies suggest that the predisposition to the development of IgE antibodies (“atopy”) is associated with a slow development of IgA responses, e.g. our own data shows a delay in development of specific IgA in cow's milk-allergic infants. Exciting new discoveries further support the role for specific IgA come from trials of orally induced tolerance in established food allergy. Because there is an intimate reciprocal development of gut microbial communities with the IgA repertoire, we hypothesize that mucosal exposure to a diverse and immunogenic microbiome accelerates the development of IgA secretory immunity, counteracts development of IgE responses, and protects from allergic diseases.  We will assess how B cell subsets, immunoglobulin repertoire and somatic mutation rates (Aim 1), and gut microbiome and IgA antibody responses to microbiome develop in cohorts of high- and low-risk for allergy (Aim 2), and how these B cell biomarkers and gut microbiome relate to the development of food and other allergic diseases and humoral responses to allergens (Aim 3). In summary, this proposal will determine whether accelerated development of IgA responses is a biomarker for “protective” immune development, identify fecal bacteria inducing IgA responses, and assess the association of specific IgA immune responses with clinical tolerance, i.e. protection from early-onset food allergy and eczema. NARRATIVE The microbiome plays a critical role in the development of the immune system, and alterations in the microbiome diversity almost certainly play an important role in the surge of allergic and autoimmune diseases in developed nations. A major gap is our understanding of how the microbiome prevents allergic diseases. In this proposal, we will evaluate the development of infant immune system in populations at high risk and those at low risk for food allergy and other allergic diseases. The Old Order Mennonites (OOM) have a very low risk for allergic diseases and asthma and a lifestyle associated with a diverse microbiome; high-risk population includes families with food allergic children. These studies of immune system development in a population “protected” from allergic diseases will provide critical new knowledge about the development of the mucosal and systemic immunity, and lay the groundwork for future studies of prevention of allergic diseases in childhood.",Development of Mucosal and Systemic Immunity and Risk of Food Allergy,9895622,U01AI131344,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Age-Months', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cattle', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Eczema', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Family', 'Farming environment', 'Feces', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Home environment', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Measures', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Mennonite', 'Milk', 'Mucosal Immunity', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Neonatal', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Plasma Cells', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Secretory Immunoglobulin A', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Systems Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vaginal delivery procedure', 'animal data', 'atopy', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early onset', 'food allergen', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'infancy', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism antigen', 'mucosal site', 'neonate', 'peripheral blood', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'response', 'support vector machine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,U01,2020,449434,0.015045379876251184
"Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1 Project Summary The Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding domain is the most common domain in human yet the DNA-binding specificities for the great majority of these proteins remain undefined. Mutations in many of these domains, both with and without known DNA-binding data, have been linked to a host of diseases from Alzheimers (REST) to Cancer (e.g. Slug, WT1, CTCF). Therefore, the characterization of these proteins holds great value. Unfortunately common methodologies used to determine the DNA-binding specificity of transcription factors have failed to address the zinc finger, at least in part because of an inability to fully define the large target specificities required of the average mammalian zinc finger protein. Even when ChIP-Seq data exists it is limited because the size of the genome does not allow us to capture the full binding potential of a factor that could offer a ≥21bp target sequence. As a result, without a comprehensive understanding of a protein’s binding potential, SNPs across the genome will continue to represent potential binding sites that we are unable to predict. In sum, decades of research have enlightened our understanding of this domain but we are still in the dark when it comes to its function as a transcription factors. Recently we have taken an alternative approach to define this domain, demonstrating that a synthetic, one-by-one screen of individual zinc fingers allows us to predict the specificity of multi-fingered proteins with similar or greater accuracy than all prior prediction algorithms. However, this approach fails to take into consideration the influences that adjacent fingers have on one another. We have produced the equivalent of a comprehensive snapshot of what a zinc finger is capable of in just one of many potential contextual environments. Here we propose to scale this approach and screen the zinc finger under an inclusive set of contextual environments. We will consider the most common direct and indirect influences on adjacent finger binding as well as factors that impact the geometry with which the zinc fingers engage the DNA. We will use these results to provide a complete picture of how adjacent zinc fingers determine their specificity and by scaffolding these two-fingered models, predict and design the specificity of large, multi-fingered proteins. In this way, we will define a multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity that allows us to predict all zinc finger DNA-binding specificities, how any neighbor finger context would modify this specificity, and the factors that result in adjacent finger incompatibility and loss of DNA-binding function. We will apply this model to predict the specificity of all human zinc finger proteins, validate these predictions through in vivo characterization of an informed set of transcription factors, and test predicted mechanisms of multi-fingered binding with designer, artificial factors. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the ZF domain is the most common in human yet it remains largely uncharacterized. A holistic understanding of ZF function will provide insight into how ZF mutations are related to disease and allow us to predict harmful binding sites due to SNPs across the genome.",Defining the multi-dimensional code of zinc finger specificity-Resubmission-1,9849781,R01GM118851,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'ChIP-seq', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fingers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'WT1 gene', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'model design', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'slug', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,393339,-0.008346369554754901
"Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT It is becoming increasingly evident that the composition and metabolites produced by the human gut microbiome influence the progression of cardiovascular diseases. While we are continuing to discover important associations between the gut microbiome and human physiology and diseases, we lack the tools and methodology to precisely manipulate gut microbiota to benefit human health. We propose to develop computational models and optimization frameworks to predict community dynamics and functions and design interventions to shift the gut microbiome to desired states. We will design novel bacterial therapeutics that operate autonomously in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract to steer the microbiome towards healthy states. These next-generation bacterial therapeutics will sense important gut microbiome metabolites, process information, and deliver species- specific antimicrobial proteins to reshape the dynamics and functions of this ecosystem. The performance of these bacterial therapeutics will be characterized in vitro using synthetic human gut microbiome communities and in gnotobiotic mouse models of cardiovascular disease. Model-guided microbiome engineering has the potential to transform human medicine and is becoming increasingly important as scientists continue to discover connections between the microbiome and human health and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent studies have shown close connections between the human gut microbiome and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), which are the leading cause of death worldwide. While engineering of the gut microbiome holds tremendous potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for CVD, we currently lack the tools and methodology required to design interventions that precisely shift the structure and function of the gut microbiome. The major goals of our project are to (1) develop computational modeling techniques to design perturbations that can steer the microbiome to desired states and (2) design next-generation bacterial therapeutics that sense major gut microbiome-produced metabolites and deliver selective antimicrobials to shift microbiome states to ameliorate CVD.",Model-guided design of next-generation bacterial therapeutics to treat cardiovascular disease,10044931,R01EB030340,"['Address', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bacteroides', 'Behavior', 'Biosensor', 'Butyrates', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Equilibrium', 'Escherichia coli', 'Feedback', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Scientist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'computer framework', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human disease', 'lysin', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'mouse model', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'real time monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'trimethylamine']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,697498,0.044255517630476415
"Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach Project Summary Seasonal influenza is a significant public health concern, yet it is not clear why individuals and populations differ in their protection against influenza infection. The factors underlying protection can act at multiple scales, and thus building a more complete understanding of protection requires an approach that integrates data at the population, individual, and molecular levels. What factors influence population and individual risk of influenza infection? How different are the antibody responses of individuals against influenza and what factors drive those differences? Here, I propose to identify the relative influence of past infection, vaccination, and antigenic evolution on determining both individual and population susceptibility by quantitatively modeling high-resolution epidemiological and immunological data. In particular, I aim to determine the role of past influenza infection in shaping the susceptibility of different age groups, identify the specific targets of the human antibody response against influenza, and infer the relative importance of infection history, vaccination, and epitope immunogenicity on antibody specificity. This work will have a significant impact on our ability to predict future influenza infection and allow us to target interventions toward the most at-risk populations. Success of this project requires training in advanced computational and statistical methods and state-of-the-art immunological techniques by members of the Departments of Ecology & Evolution and Medicine at the University of Chicago. This interdisciplinary and collaborative training environment will provide a strong foundation for gaining more complete understanding of the interactions between influenza and the human immune system. Project Narrative Influenza infection is a significant public health concern resulting in thousands of deaths annually. Here, I propose to systematically identify how exposure history, vaccination, and other factors affect individual susceptibility to influenza infection. These insights will improve our ability to identify populations most at-risk for infection as well as allow us to tailor intervention and prevention efforts to more effectively combat seasonal influenza.",Identifying determinants of human immunity against influenza: a multiscale approach,10008955,F32AI145177,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Avidity', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycoproteins', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neuraminidase', 'Pattern', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive measure', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seasons', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface Antigens', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'age group', 'base', 'cohort', 'combat', 'design', 'immunogenicity', 'imprint', 'improved', 'individual response', 'infection risk', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'seasonal influenza', 'success', 'universal influenza vaccine']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F32,2020,65310,-0.008354907783555524
"Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes Project Summary Over the last two decades, significant experimental efforts have determined large sets of “reference” interactions for humans and other model organisms, along with substantial knowledge about the binding specificities of proteins, including for a large fraction of human transcription factors (TFs). The resulting data have proven to be an incredibly useful resource for understanding how cells function; nevertheless, they do not capture how molecular interactions and networks are different from the reference across individuals. Indeed, while human genomes in both healthy and disease populations are rapidly being sequenced, the corresponding individual-specific interaction networks remain largely unexamined; this represents a major gap in our knowledge, as mutations that alter molecular interactions underlie a wide range of human diseases. Further, the substantial amount of genetic variation across populations makes it infeasible in the near term to experimentally determine per-individual interaction networks. Thus our long-term goal is to develop computational methods to uncover whether and how mutations within coding and non-coding portions of the genome perturb cellular interactions and networks. Our specific aims are: (1) We will develop computational structure-based approaches to identify and catalog, at proteome-scale, variations within proteins that are likely to impact their ability to bind with DNA, RNA, small molecules, peptides or ions, thereby providing a comprehensive resource for analyzing protein interaction variation. (2) We will develop novel structure-based and probabilistic methods to predict how DNA-binding specificities are altered when a TF is mutated; since mutated TFs have been linked to numerous diseases, this will be a great aid in understanding disease networks and pathology. (3) We will develop new methods to uncover non-coding somatic mutations that alter human regulatory networks in cancer; this is a critical step towards ultimately uncovering patient-specific cancer networks. Overall by pursuing these aims—which integrate mutational information with existing knowledge about reference interactions, interfaces and specificities—we will develop novel computational methods that will significantly advance our understanding of molecular interactions perturbed in disease and healthy contexts. Narrative The proposed research will yield new software tools that predict whether specific genetic mutations alter molecular interactions and networks. Since many human diseases are caused by mutations that affect molecular interactions, this research will expand our understanding of the underlying basis of disease and will provide new avenues for diagnosis and treatment.",Predicting and analyzing variation in cellular interactomes,9896829,R01GM076275,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Organism', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc Fingers', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,312660,-0.033614482510113286
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,-0.006222018206019256
"Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC Title: Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with and without NEC Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that frequently results in death (20- 50%) or severe systemic complications. Although NEC is a multifactorial disease, its precise etiology continues to be poorly understood. As such, there are still no effective prevention methods or treatments available. Given increased intestinal and systemic inflammation seen in NEC, it is likely that the dysregulation of the immune system contributes to its pathogenesis. In order to better understand NEC pathogenesis, it is essential to have a solid understanding of normal immune development that occurs over the first two months of age in premature infants. Our preliminary data obtained from fetuses, patients with NEC and control subjects, show that there is a drastic reduction of total and tissue resident memory T cells in the intestinal tissue and an increase in T cells in the periphery. Moreover, NEC is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in intestinal tissue, and a concomitant decrease in circulating monocytes. Recent work has begun to address how neonatal peripheral immunity develops. However, data on the peripheral immune development in premature infants over the first two months of life is sparse. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory proposal is to define normal immune development of premature infants over the first two months of life and characterize its dysregulation in patients with NEC. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that development of the peripheral immune system in preterm infants is different in the innate and adaptive immune compartments from that of term infants, and it is this difference that makes them susceptible to NEC. As the blood volume in premature infants is limited, we have developed a methodology to perform deep immunophenotyping on as little as 100 µliters of blood using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). This unique methodology will allow us to address the hypothesis, with the following aims: 1) Define the peripheral immune development of premature infants (<32 weeks) over the first two months of life. We will perform CyTOF on peripheral blood from 50 premature infants, with samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Deep characterization of the immune cell landscape and maps of the developmental trajectories of the major cell lineages in premature infants will be generated. 2) Identify peripheral immune cell abnormalities associated with the development of NEC. We will identify dysregulation of immune population trajectories specific to premature infants who develop NEC. This information will provide us with a model for the immune cell mechanism underlying susceptibility to NEC. This project would represent the first detailed deep examination of the development of the immune system in premature infants with and without NEC over the first two months, and will provide sufficient data for the development of a large-scale, in-depth study of the mechanism underlying the development of NEC. Project Narrative: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of premature birth that frequently results in significant mortality and morbidity the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the development of the immune system in premature infants would allow for improved methods to prevent and treat NEC. We propose to use state of the art methods to define the immune system in premature infants in the first two months of life, in order to provide a foundation for further research into the development of treatments for NEC.",Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC,10038410,R21HD102565,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucosal Immune System', 'Mus', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Secondary to', 'Small Intestines', 'Solid', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'cost estimate', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prevent', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,223344,0.00026853512082884945
"Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions Project Summary/Abstract DNA sequencing has spawned the “microbiome revolution” -- thousands of microbes and a dizzying number of microbial interactions that are associated with human health and disease. Unfortunately, most species in the microbiome are known only by a (partial) genome. The limited phenotypic data on newly discovered bacteria reveal species that behave unlike any of our model organisms. While genome-scale modeling plays an important role in understanding the microbiome, the paucity of phenotypic data for most species prevents detailed simulation of the microbial communities that affect our health. This project will develop an automated system for profiling, synthesizing, and modeling microbial communities. The center of our approach is Deep Phenotyping, an automated robotic platform that performs complex growth experiments on demand. Data from Deep Phenotyping will be used to train metabolic and statistical models of the oral pathogens Streptococcus mutans and Candida albicans to predict conditions that keep both microbes in a nonpathogenic state. Project Narrative The microbiome revolution has uncovered thousands of species of bacteria with roles in health and disease. This project automates the identification of interactions between environments, genes, and the microbes that live in and around us. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in re-engineering the microbiome to improve human health.","Automated, model-guided phenotyping to identify metabolite/gene/microbe interactions",9852330,R21EB027396,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Candida albicans', 'Carbon', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Oral', 'Oral candidiasis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Streptococcus mutans', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'fungus', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microorganism interaction', 'network models', 'open source', 'oral pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'phenotypic data', 'preference', 'prevent', 'screening', 'simulation', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transposon sequencing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,178949,0.030317472506809027
"Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract) In addition to genetics and environment, interindividual variation in epigenetic regulation may determine risk of obesity. Exceptional genomic loci called metastable epialleles offer unprecedented opportunities to test this. Metastable epialleles – essentially epigenetic polymorphisms – exhibit interindividual variation in DNA methylation that is neither tissue-specific nor genetically mediated. Metastable epialleles were first discovered in mice when dramatic phenotypic variation was observed amongst inbred mice. Over the last 10 years we pioneered the discovery and characterization of human metastable epialleles. We have shown that DNA methylation profiling of multiple tissues in multiple individuals is an effective approach to identifying regions that exhibit systemic interindividual variation in DNA methylation, a hallmark of metastable epialleles. Now that we know epigenetic metastability is common to mice and humans, it is essential to identify and explore the full range of MEs in the mouse. We therefore propose to pursue the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Perform an unbiased screen for mouse metastable epialleles. Aim 2 - Test for effects of maternal dietary methyl donor supplementation on offspring DNA methylation at metastable epialleles. Aim 3: Use comparative genomics to identify sequence determinants of epigenetic metastability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide the foundation for development of mouse (and potentially other mammalian) models which will enable controlled experiments to help understand how interindividual variation in DNA methylation affects risk of disease in humans. PROJECT NARRATIVE (Relevance Statement) Just as individual genetic variation can affect risk of disease, so too can individual epigenetic variation. In particular, special genomic regions called metastable epialleles, which were first discovered in mice, offer the best opportunities to advance our understanding of epigenetic etiology of disease because their systemic nature means that – like genetic polymorphisms – they can be assessed in any easily obtainable tissue sample, such as peripheral blood. Now that we know that metastable epialleles also exist in humans, we urgently need to develop a more complete catalog of these genomic regions in the mouse, to enable well- controlled experiments to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of interindividual epigenetic variation at these loci.",Unbiased identification and characterization of mouse metastable epialleles,10032890,R01DK125562,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Base Sequence', 'Beds', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cleft Palate', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Dietary Supplementation', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Fingerprintings', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Germ Layers', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Mouse', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intracisternal A-Particle Elements', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methylation', 'Micronutrients', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Paper', 'Phenotype', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrotransposon', 'Seminal', 'Supplementation', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Variant', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'critical period', 'disorder risk', 'early pregnancy', 'embryo culture', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenetic variation', 'experimental study', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolic phenotype', 'mother nutrition', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'nonhuman primate', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'offspring', 'peripheral blood', 'transgenerational epigenetic inheritance']",NIDDK,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,500075,0.03742656539494201
"Pro-inflammatory activation of human macrophages regulated by lncRNAs Project Summary Macrophage activation promotes major inflammatory disorders, including arterial diseases. Its underlying mechanisms, however, remain obscure. The present study will establish a systems approach, involving computational prediction analyses, multi-omics, network science, and in vitro and in vivo validation, to discover long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)-mediated mechanisms for pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and arterial disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will involve omics studies of human macrophages to identify lncRNAs and their interacting proteins and develop computational analyses to predict human lncRNAs that regulate macrophage activation. Specific Aim 2 will examine the functionality of candidate lncRNAs in macrophage activation in vitro and in vivo. The findings from the study will help to identify new mechanisms for macrophage activation and may provide molecular bases for new therapies. Project Narrative Inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery disease and other major vascular diseases, global health threats. Even with potent risk modifiers, e.g., statins, many patients still suffer vascular events. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate various biological processes.

"Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease Evidence suggests that lifestyle changes, concordant with the adoption of agriculture and industrialization, have impacted the emergence of the so-called diseases of modern civilization in humans (e.g. metabolic disorders, cardiovascular disease etc.). The incidence of these diseases in contemporary, industrialized populations is believed to be associated with a lack of adaptation of our genomes to the rapid dietary and lifestyle changes that occurred across human evolution. However the usefulness and resolution of this evolutionary model of disease are limited. Moreover, although the dietary and genetic markers of human evolution have been studied, we still lack understanding on how the microbiome, our second genome, has interacted with nutritional and host- genomic axes to confer increased disease risk in modern humans. Preliminary data by our group show that dietary shifts significantly modulate the gut microbiome and metabolome of wild primates, our closest evolutionary relatives. Additionally, we have identified gut microbiome markers only found in populations representing Paleolithic lifestyles (hunter-gatherers) and distinguishing them from traditional agriculturalists and industrialized populations. Thus, given 1) the potential role of diet in human evolution, 2) the critical impact of the gut microbiome on the nutritional and immune landscape of mammals, and 3) the existence of gut microbiome patterns exclusive of hunter-gatherers, we hypothesize that the emergence of metabolic disease in modern humans was significantly mediated by interactions between diet, the gut microbiome and the human genome across evolution. These issues are still unexplored. Thus, in Aim 1 of this proposal we will use a multi- OMIC approach (gut metabolomics, metagenomics and transcriptomics of the host colonic tissue) to identify metabolic and genetic markers that emerged and/or were lost when humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer to agricultural and industrialized lifestyles, and in humans affected by metabolic disease phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will use integrated meta-OMICs and network theory approaches to predict metabolic disease phenotypes, from hunter-gatherers to, populations in transition to agriculture to modern populations at risk. This system-level study will broaden our understanding of the extrinsic (environmental/nutritional) and intrinsic factors (genetic/metabolic) impacting the evolution of modern human disease. Additionally, the evolutionary approach proposed will shed light on potentially novel diet and microbe-based translational strategies to mitigate the incidence of metabolic disease in contemporary human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high incidence of metabolic disorders (disorders of glucose, lipid and energy metabolism) is a significant public health threat in industrialized populations, affecting up to 25% of the adult population. Despite extensive work on characterizing the nutritional and genetic backgrounds of common metabolic disorders, we still have limited understanding as to how these factors interact with each other and with the gut microbiome, our second genome. This proposal interrogates the evolutionary baseline of modern human disease by exploring associations between nutritional, (host)genetic and microbiome markers in hunter-gatherers, traditional agriculturalists and industrialized human populations susceptible to metabolic disorders. The implementation of an evolutionary, system-level model improves our understanding of modern human disease, and, validates existing and novel dietary interventions to lessen their incidence in industrialized societies.",Dietary modulation of gut microbiome and host gene expression across human evolution and the emergence of modern human disease,9892997,R01DK112381,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African', 'Agriculture', 'Americas', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Civilization', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glucose Metabolism Disorders', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'High Density Lipoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intrinsic factor', 'Jamaica', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Triglycerides', 'Trinidad', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'fecal metabolome', 'glycemic control', 'gut microbiome', 'human disease', 'improved', 'lipid metabolism', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial host', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'nutrition related genetics', 'theories', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'translational approach']",NIDDK,"J.

"Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID) SUMMARY  While the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health and disease is well established, few studies have evaluated the contribution of the virome. Recently, we demonstrated that alterations in the enteric virome in adulthood are associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and AIDS. In a cross- sectional comparison of IBD cases and household controls, a significant expansion of the Caudovirales, an order of phages, and anelloviruses, a family of eukaryotic DNA viruses, was observed. Advancing understanding of the IBD virome beyond this finding is limited by: (1) A lack of well defined longitudinal human cohorts to enable discovery of temporal associations of the virome with health and disease; (2) The challenge of viral “dark matter”. Dark matter refers to the typically >50% of the sequences present in purified virus preparations cannot be classified due to a lack of statistically significant alignment to known reference sequences. Thus, current virome studies effectively assess < 50% of the virome, thereby compromising our ability to detect important associations between the virome and disease; (3) Inadequate experimental systems to manipulate the virome. Although sequencing has identified many novel eukaryotic viruses, there are only cell culture systems for a limited number of viruses; moreover, there are no small animal infection models for newly described viruses. In addition while a tremendous diversity of phage has been identified, only a tiny fraction have known hosts and an even smaller fraction has been cultured. Thus, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to be able to experimentally test the impact of either eukaryotic viruses or phages in murine IBD models. These barriers to understanding the role of the IBD virome will be addressed as follows: Aim 1 will define the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a longitudinal cohort of IBD patients and household controls and identify virome associations with IBD. In Aim 2 novel computational tools to identify and characterize viruses present in enteric viromes will be developed, including approaches to classify dark matter. In Aim 3 novel experimental systems for functional virome analysis, including novel cultures of both eukaryotic viruses and phages as well as animal infection models, will be developed with the end goal of evaluating causal roles for the viruses and phage in existing muring IBD models. Together, these Aims will not only address significant barriers in understanding of IBD, but will provide a wealth of tangible computational and experimental resources to advance the general field of virome studies.   NARRATIVE The overall goal of this project is to develop novel computational and experimental tools to address challenges in understanding the role of viruses in inflammatory bowel disease. These tools will facilitate studies of not only inflammatory bowel disease, but also broader studies of the relationship of the human virome to other diseases.  ",Computational and Experimental Resources for Virome Analysis in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (CERVAID),10019521,RC2DK116713,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophages', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caudovirales', 'Cell Culture System', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'DNA Viruses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Enteral', 'Family', 'Feces', 'Genome', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Norovirus', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Parasitic infection', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Viral Genes', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'bacterial resistance', 'bacteriome', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'early childhood', 'experimental analysis', 'genome annotation', 'gut microbiome', 'human virome', 'improved', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'molecular sequence database', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'phenomenological models', 'protein function', 'software development', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'virology', 'virome']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,RC2,2020,1832307,0.012359073557430052
"A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions Project summary There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how mutations are preferentially targeted to the variable (V) regions of the Immunoglobulin (Ig) loci during somatic hypermutation (SHM). The persistence of this gap has limited our understanding of the mutagenic mechanisms involving activation-induced deaminase (AID) in the immune response and in the role of AID in mis-targeting mutations leading to B-cell lymphomas and other cancers. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the global targeting of mutations in immunity that are required to protect us from infections. As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,10090262,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,38074,0.0035821417040016383
"Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines The “Computational Models of Immunity” projects in this application focus on development and implementation of new structure-based design tools for influenza hemagglutinin (HA) protein trimer interface specific antibodies or vaccine antigens. These projects will use knowledge about the structure and function of human neutralizing antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head that we have in hand or will discover, in order to design new antibodies or vaccines in silico. We have access to peripheral blood cells from a diverse panels of subjects with prior natural infection, or exposure to experimental inoculation with vaccines encoding HA molecules with both seasonal vaccines and unusual experimental influenza subtypes, including H3variant, H5, H6, H7, H9, and H10 viruses. The immune B memory cell populations from these individuals are the ideal starting materials to isolate unusual heterosubtypic antibodies. Recently, we identified the HA head trimer interface as a major new site of vulnerability for universal influenza antibodies and candidate vaccines. Here, we will study existing and isolate additional broadly heterosubtypic human antibodies to the trimer interface of the HA head. We will determine the immunome of the responding heterosubtypic clones using high-throughput next generation sequencing of antibody gene repertoires that comprise the clonal lineages of the most heterosubtypic antibodies isolated. Once antibodies with unusual breadth or activity are isolated, the structure of these antibodies will be determined in complex with purified HA molecules in the Structural Core using crystallography and single particle electron microscopy (EM) studies. Such structures will provide the coordinates for the modeling experiments using Rosetta. We will in silico mature human antibodies to increase affinity for the HA antigen of specific virus types and use multi-state design to maximize breadth, i.e., create antibodies that recognize HAs of all clades, subtypes, groups, or even types. We then will synthesize and express these novel antibodies and determine neutralization activity, binding affinity, and competition binding groups of designed antibodies, using a diverse HA panel and pseudotyped viruses with all type A HAs in nature. The co-crystal structure of these human antibodies with HA will be the template for in silico design of structurally stable epitope-focused immunogens. We will first validate these designed immunogens by testing the interaction with the target human antibodies. Further, these immunogens will be experimentally tested by evaluating immune responses. Then, we will use the novel immunogens to isolate new antibodies from subjects naturally exposed to influenza, to show that the immunogens present antigens recognized by natural immune responses. The next generation of viral vaccines and biologics alike will be designed rationally, based on a structural understanding of how protective antibodies engage the epitope of the target. The multidisciplinary group in this application will develop and implement new structure based computational models, and then validate the power of the computational design approach with laboratory experiments focused on the structural basis of broad neutralization of influenza through recognition of the a novel site of vulnerability in the interface of the hemagglutinin head domain.",Structure based design of trimer interface epitope focused universal influenza vaccines,9950456,U01AI150739,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Blood Cells', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crystallization', 'Crystallography', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exposure to', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Polysaccharides', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Viral Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antibody engineering', 'base', 'combat', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular recognition', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoparticle', 'neutralizing antibody', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'particle', 'programs', 'protective efficacy', 'receptor binding', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic vaccine', 'tool', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U01,2020,1265006,-0.02435773574296888

As high-throughput data from human antibody immune responses became available, it provided us with new opportunities to generate hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms of SHM. We now propose to generate further hypotheses using computational models applied to additional databases and to validate these hypotheses using cellular and animal experiments. Our objective is to understand what directs SHM across the many human Ig heavy chain V-regions. Our central hypothesis is that the V-region SHM process is highly dependent on a DNA sequence signature(s) that drives mutations in a largely deterministic fashion. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary results using human in vivo data from a few human V region genes and has begun to be validated using independent databases and experiments in human B cell lines. The rationale is that evaluations of computational data based upon biological mechanisms, together with appropriate biological experiments, will reveal the key differences between IGHV regions (IGHV 3-23, 4-34, 1-18, 1-02, etc.) that lead to the dominance of each of those V regions in the responses to medically important antigens. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) identify the extent to which a DNA signature determines the mutation process in four individual human IGHV genes that are important in disease responses; 2) examine the relationship between AID hotspots and Polη hotspots across all the other human V region genes, thus rigorously defining a mutation targeting signature. Both aims will also entail studying human V region genes and modifications of them in human cell lines and in mice expressing a human V region to further confirm the signature and identify molecular mechanisms in vivo. Our approach is innovative because the computational models we are proposing will be mechanistically motivated focusing on the interaction between AID and Polη hotspots, thus testing molecular mechanisms as opposed to classic statistical models using whole V region sequences that ignore the underlying biology. In addition, to focus on mechanisms we will leverage new high-throughput data from human V regions that have not undergone antigen selection. Our results will be highly relevant to human IgV repertoire analyses from immune responses that are currently hard to interpret and will help future vaccine and therapeutic antibody development, as well as help to understand mutations in human malignancies where AID plays a key role. Project narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the targeting of AID-mediated mutations across many human heavy chain V-regions will make it possible to develop vaccines that will lead more rapidly to better and more broadly protective antibodies to infectious agents and reveal the risk factors in the development of B-cell malignancies and gastric and other solid tumors where AID is implicated.",A combined computational and experimental approach to the evolution and role of the DNA sequence environment in targeting mutations to antibody V regions,9882227,R01AI132507,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Experiments', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B lymphoid malignancy', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene-Modified', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Heavy-Chain Immunoglobulins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Influenza', 'Influenza Hemagglutinin', 'Knock-in', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mismatch Repair', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stomach', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'activation-induced cytidine deaminase', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'density', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'neutralizing antibody', 'recruit', 'repair enzyme', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'vaccine response']",NIAID,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,591815,0.0035821417040016383
"Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) Project Summary Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) We aim to develop mathematical models for the rational design of microbiota transplants that can restore compositional diversity and function to the damaged microbiota of antibiotic-treated patients. We will focus on hospitalized cancer patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (allo-HSCT). Allo-HSCT is a potentially curative cancer treatment that compromises the immune system, and requires that patients receive massive antibiotic treatments to prevent and treat life-threatening infections. We will build on a vast clinical database, in vitro experiments in bioreactors and in vivo experiments with mice to develop dynamic mathematical models that describe how antibiotics cause changes in the microbial composition, and how that can impact the recovery of the host's immune system after allo-HSCT. The model expands approaches pioneered by our team—the Generalized Lotka Volterra Ecological Regression (GLOVER) and agent-based models—towards a model that can assist in the development of microbiota therapies for patients undergoing allo-HSCT.  In aim 1 we will use data from a unique clinical resource available at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center—a sample bank obtained from >1,500 allo-HSCT patients (including microbiome 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing) and extensive clinical metadata (including time series of complete blood counts and time and doses of all drugs given while the patients are hospitalized); we will also use data from a first-of-its-kind controlled randomized trial of autologous fecal microbiota transplant (auto-FMT) undergoing in allo-HSCT patients. We will use these unique resources to parameterize our models and investigate how the microbiota composition influences the recovery of the host immune system. In aim 2 we will validate the microbial component of our mathematical model using experimental data from anaerobic laboratory reactors that recreate—in vitro—the human microbiota dynamics during antibiotic treatment and auto-FMT in the absence of a living host. In aim 3 we will develop mouse models to investigate those same microbiota dynamics experimentally but now in the context of a living host.  The data obtained from these clinical studies, in vitro experiments and in vivo models will refine our mathematical models in close cycles of simulation and quantitative experimentation. Our ultimate goal is to develop models that can define optimal microbial cocktails and reconstitute the perturbed microbiota of allo- HSCT patients. In the process we hope to uncover general principles of microbiota ecology for future therapies in other patient populations whose microbiota is damaged by antibiotic treatments. Project Narrative Mathematical ecology models of host-microbiota interaction  in auto microbiota transplants (auto-FMT) The intestinal microbiota is an ecosystem with thousands of bacterial species that interact with each other and with their living host.

"Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces Project Summary The innate immune system constitutes the first line of host defense. The invasion of external pathogens leads into inflammatory responses, including the clinical signs such as swelling. During inflammation, cytokines are released from injured cells.  They recruit leukocytes to reach the site of injury and remove the foreign pathogens. Proteins in the superfamily of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are one major class of these cytokines. They bind to the cell surface proteins called TNF-receptors. The binding between TNF and receptors triggers the intracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-κB pathway that is an essential regulator of cell survival. Due to this critical role in immune responses, binding of TNF receptors with their ligands is under intense study. However, most of these studies isolate the TNF receptors from their usual biological surrounding. In living cells, TNF receptors are anchored on surfaces of plasma membrane. The membrane confinement of TNF receptors causes significant impacts on their functions. For instance, the TNF ligand oligomerization provides high local binding avidity to receptors. Moreover, TNF receptors can aggregate into high- order clusters upon ligand binding. Mechanisms underlying these phenomena are not fully understood due to current experimental limitations. Computational modeling can reach dimensions that are currently unapproachable in the laboratory. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to decompose the complexity of binding kinetics between TNF soluble ligands and cell-surface-bound receptors. We have developed different methods for calculating binding affinities between protein and simulating protein binding kinetics on the molecular and lower-resolution levels. Through the application of these methods to the specific problem of TNF receptor binding on cell surfaces, and the establishment of ongoing experimental collaborations, we are specifically interested in answering the following two questions: how does oligomerization of TNF ligands modulate receptor binding, and what are the functional roles of TNF receptor clustering in regulating ligand binding. In order to study these two problems, we construct a new domain-based rigid-body model and further develop a multiscale modeling framework to quantitatively calculate the kinetics of binding between multivalent ligands and multiple receptors on cell surfaces. Our long-term goal is to further elucidate the functional roles of TNF-mediated signaling in regulating the inflammatory responses. In summary, this study will shed light on the basic mechanisms of TNF receptor binding on cell surface. Project Narrative The cellular functions of interaction between tumor necrosis factors (TNF) and their receptors are not fully understood. This proposal aims to simulate the binding process of TNF ligands with their receptors on cell surfaces by multi-scale computational methods. TNF receptors are the common drug targets for autoimmune diseases. Understand their cellular mechanism of binding therefore is highly relevant to public health.",Computational models for the signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor on cell surfaces,9983105,R01GM122804,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Avidity', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Surface Proteins', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell membrane', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fibrinogen', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Homo', 'Host Defense', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Innate Immune System', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Mutate', 'N-terminal', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Property', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Swelling', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factors', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Whole Organism', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large-scale database', 'method development', 'multi-scale modeling', 'pathogen', 'physical process', 'protein complex', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'recruit', 'simulation', 'tumor necrosis factor receptor binding']",NIGMS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,327738,-0.025277301820481275
"Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias Abstract Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, play a significant role in human disease. DNA methylation is altered in cancer, and DNA methylation-induced silencing of promoters of tumor-suppressors is thought to play a key role in tumorigenesis. Though there is an increasing number of methylation sequencing datasets generated from cancer, they are confounded by tumor heterogeneity. Understanding the subclonal architecture underlying heterogeneity is important because individual cancer subclones impact cancer growth, treatment resistance, and metastasis. Increased “epigenetic heterogeneity,” or variation in DNA methylation patterns, was determined to be correlated with worse prognosis in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, these studies only profiled epigenetic heterogeneity at a global scale and did not analyze methylation of individual subclones. Many computational methods have been developed for this purpose in epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), but these methods are not applicable for methylation sequencing data. As such, there is a need to develop new computational methods to study subclonal methylation profiles in cancer. I will develop a novel computational method (DXM) that deconvolves DNA methylation of heterogeneous clinical samples into their major subpopulations, their prevalence, and their respective DNA methylation profiles (Aim 1). DXM will be developed on simulations generated from data available from both the Roadmap Epigenomics Project and the Blueprint Epigenome Project and will be validated with methylation sequencing on DLBCL samples. I will then leverage DXM to study subclonal methylation profiles in AML (Aim 2). I hypothesize that methylation can confer fitness advantages in epigenetic subclones of AML, leading to clonal expansion following therapeutic intervention and subsequent relapse. Using DXM, I will first identify epigenetic subclones from whole genome bisulfite sequencing data from AML patients with well-characterized genetic subclonal architecture and compare the epigenetic subclonal architecture to that of the genetic subclones. In a second dataset containing methylation sequencing data from paired diagnosis-relapse samples, I will apply DXM, identify subclonal methylation profiles, and characterize all genes impacted by subclonal methylation to determine if they are expected to confer fitness advantages. Finally, I will test if mutations known to impact DNA methylation in AML (DNMT3A, IDH1/2) alter epigenetic subclonal expansion. Taken together, this proposal will result in a new computational approach to interpret epigenetic data from heterogeneous clinical samples as well as identification of DNA methylation changes in epigenetic subclones of AML that contribute to disease progression and correlate with prognosis. Project Narrative Studies that characterize which variations in cancer relate to worse outcome may do analysis on the entire tumor sample, which is composed of many different types of cells, each with distinct biology. The goal of this proposal is to develop a novel computational method to analyze variations in cancer at the level of cell-types. These results can be used to improve patient prognostics and care in multiple cancers.",Identification of epigenetic subclones in lymphomas and leukemias,9931169,F30CA224687,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'CpG dinucleotide', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Relapse', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor Promoters', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States', 'Variant', 'X Inactivation', 'anticancer research', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'design', 'epigenome', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'epigenomics', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'leukemia/lymphoma', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'simulation', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,47730,0.061329752678658304
"Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity PROJECT SUMMARY  The risk of fatality and/or severe complications due to COVID-19 infection is strongly age dependent. Data from the CDC suggests that those ages 85 and older have predicted mortality rates that is 100-fold higher than for those under the age of 50 and currently, 8 out of 10 COVID-19 deaths in the United States were in adults age 65 or older. While the exact etiology underlying this age disparity is unknown, evidence suggests that vulnerability may be due to changes that occur as a function of the aging process. This is further evidenced by the pattern of increased vulnerability among persons with pre-existing diseases of aging—cardiovascular disease, diabetes, COPD, chronic kidney disease, liver disease—suggesting that it isn't just chronological age that determines risk, but rather, biological age.  In recent years, our group has helped develop some of the most robust biomarkers available, namely the epigenetic clocks. These measures estimate biological age in a sample based on DNA methylation levels at hundreds to thousands of CpG sites across the genome. Not only do epigenetic clocks track with age in diverse tissues and cell types, but discrepancies between epigenetic age and actual age have also been shown to predict risk of mortality and incidence of major chronic disease, including those which appear to be major risk factors for COVID-19. However, in order for these measures to be informative for assessing COVID-19 risk clinically, or in the general population, 1) they need to be re-optimized to capture the aspects of biological aging specific to COVID-19 susceptibility, and 2) advances in technology need to be made to ensure lower costs and rapid turnaround.  This proposal aims to build on our team's multidisciplinary strengths to develop and validate a targeted, lab-developed, readily-available test to predict COVID-19 symptomology and mortality risk. If successful, this test will have widespread applications—from informing triage and treatment decisions in the clinic, to guiding social and pollical decisions when it comes to lifting “stay-at-home” orders for certain individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE The risks associated with COVID-19 infection are highly age and health dependent, suggesting that biological aging may be a major determinant for symptom severity and mortality risk. Based on our previous work in developing biomarkers of aging, we propose to develop and validate a novel, rapid, and affordable COVID-19 test to predict long-term response to infection, based on DNA methylation.",Epigenetic Age Measures to Predict COVID-19 Symptom Progression and Severity,10158592,R00AG052604,"['Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genome', 'Geroscience', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Hypertension', 'Immunocompetence', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infection', 'Lifting', 'Liver diseases', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'bisulfite', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'genome-wide', 'human very old age (85+)', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'older patient', 'predictive marker', 'preservation', 'resilience', 'response', 'social', 'transmission process', 'trend']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,139448,-0.025257224300103017
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease.

Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,9849157,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,415624,-0.018930248043488963
"Comprehensive analysis of human adaptive immune receptors to elucidate correlates of Epstein-Barr virus disease suppression Project Summary/Abstract This project will develop a new technological approach for the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune responses, which holds the potential to catalyze new strategies to prevent and treat disease. Here we will apply immune profiling techniques recently invented by the PI to investigate the mechanisms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) adaptive immune control in clinical cohorts of infected patients. EBV is a highly prevalent pathogen infecting >90% of the world’s population. Primary EBV infection often causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) and long-term sequelae include numerous malignancies, lymphoproliferative disorders, and a strong association with multiple sclerosis. No EBV vaccine is approved to date, and the molecular mechanisms of immune protection from EBV-associated diseases are unclear. Unfortunately, prior technical barriers in high- throughput immune profiling methods have prevented a comprehensive understanding of adaptive immune protection against EBV diseases. A technological approach that identifies the critical features of EBV immune protection will advance new solutions for vaccine and therapeutic development. Therefore, we developed an experimental pipeline to enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of B- and T-cell responses to EBV that is scalable to dozens of human patients per experiment. We hypothesize that a comprehensive B- and T-cell analysis of carefully selected patient cohorts that either can or cannot suppress symptomatic infection will reveal function-based correlates of EBV control. To test this hypothesis, we will apply quantitative immune profiling technologies to analyze cryopreserved longitudinal samples from recently completed prospective clinical studies of IM. Patient samples in our cohort span pre- and post-infection through convalescence and encompass the full range of clinical IM severity scores (from 0, asymptomatic primary infection, to 6, essentially bedridden with IM). Immune profile data will be used to establish adaptive immune correlates of IM disease severity. In addition, we will analyze immune responses in apparently immunocompetent patients with chronic active EBV (CAEBV) disease, or patients who do not adequately suppress EBV infection, to gain insight regarding adaptive immune function and dysfunction in CAEBV. Finally, we will develop a new computational toolkit to rapidly identify immune correlates from high-throughput datasets. Successful completion of this project will constitute the first comprehensive functional B- and T-cell receptor analysis in a human clinical cohort. Our efforts will provide a repertoire-scale, mechanistic understanding of adaptive immunity to EBV and suggest new strategies for treatment and prevention of EBV-associated diseases. Our long-term goal is to develop human immune profiling techniques as a platform approach to accelerate the rational design of vaccines and therapeutics against pathogens of high public health importance, beginning with EBV. Project Narrative This project will apply new high-throughput immune profiling technologies to elucidate the features of effective Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immune control.

"Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are exceedingly common in immunocompromised hosts. Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) are particularly susceptible to these infections and are the patient population our studies will focus upon. Our goal is to extend and further develop systems biology approaches that our group has pioneered to identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota confers resistance to infection by Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (arKp) and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). Aim 1 of our project is to establish a clinical database from the hospital recrds of allo-HSCT patients during their initial hospitalization that will include all laboratory values,vital signs, pharmacy data, dietary data, symptoms and physical exam findings. Aim 2 will expand our fecal bank by collecting fecal samples from approximately 160 allo-HSCT patients per year and determining the presence/absence of VRE, arKp and C. diff by culture and PCR. We will use NGS of 16S rRNA genes to determine microbiota composition on each sample, will perform metagenomic and RNA sequencing to determine the bacterial transcriptome and perform metabolomic analyses on a selected subset of fecal samples. Aim 3 is to extend our mathematical modeling to identify specific members of the microbiota, metabolic pathways and metabolic products that correlate with resistance to VRE or arKp expansion in the GI tract or are associated with resistance to C. diff infection. The clinical database will be used to establish correlations between clinical treatments or events and changes in the intestinal microbiota or the expression of bacterial metabolic pathways. Ultimately, the computational platforms developed in aim 3 will identify bacterial species or consortia that are associated with resistance to infection and Aim 4 will test these associations in germ-free mouse models. We will culture bacterial species associated with resistance, colonize mice with these protective bacteria and test for resistance against VRE, arKp and C. diff. Samples obtained from these experimental studies will be subjected to metagenomic and metabolomic analyses to further refine, in an iterative fashion, computational models developed in aim 3. Our proposed studies will develop new and extend existing computational models to identify bacterial species and molecular mechanisms that confer resistance to antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The normal bacteria inhabiting the human intestine provide a high level of resistance against antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We are investigating the intestinal flora of hospitalized patients and using mathematical modeling to identify bacterial species and their metabolic products that reduce the risk of infection by three prevalent antibiotic-resistant bacteria. These studies may lead to the development of new approaches to treat and prevent antibiotic-resistant infections.",Systems Biology of Microbiome-mediated Resilience to Antibiotic-resistant Pathogens,9922844,U01AI124275,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Allogenic', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Categories', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Intestinal Content', 'Intestines', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metagenomics', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Resistance', 'Resistance to infection', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Transplantation', 'Uncertainty', 'Vancomycin Resistance', 'Vancomycin resistant enterococcus', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial drug', 'clinical database', 'clinically relevant', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal bacteria', 'commensal microbes', 'computational platform', 'computer studies', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'gut microbiota', 'host microbiome', 'immune activation', 'infection rate', 'infection risk', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'mouse model', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parallel computer', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'rRNA Genes', 'resilience', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'text searching', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1755886,0.014867150192075452
"Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response Abstract Rotavirus (RV) infection causes life-threatening, dehydrating diarrhea and is the leading cause of diarrheal deaths among children <5 years old despite availability of a vaccine. Critically, the oral vaccine is less effective in middle- and low-income countries where disproportionately more deaths occur compared to high-income countries. Addressing this disparity in vaccine effectiveness is a major public health priority. Correlates of protection do not exist, and cellular responses against RV in humans remain incompletely understood. Mounting evidence supports a direct role for the gut microbiota in modulating humoral and cellular immune responses to oral vaccines, but little is known about their actual mechanism of action. In our pilot study, vaccine responders had a significantly greater abundance of Bifidobacterium longum and higher content of microbial genes associated with folate transformation in their gut compared to nonresponders. These data suggest that infants may depend on microbes such as B. longum to synthesize folate de novo as a mechanism for RV-specific immune cell expansion. We hypothesize that de novo folate synthesis by microbes such as B. longum facilitates RV-specific immune cell expansion, and that levels of folate modulate vaccine immunogenicity. We propose to study 330 infants from the US, Panama, and Peru where vaccine efficacy is known to be high, medium and low, respectively, by using both stored and prospectively collected longitudinal samples of blood and stool from infants 0 to 12 months of age. We have designed a novel RV “megapool” of immunogenic peptides to define cellular immune responses to RV vaccination in addition to assessing traditional serum RV-specific IgA and stool RV shedding after immunization (Aim 1). We will characterize gut microbial composition and function using metagenomic sequencing at multiple pre-vaccination time points in vaccine responders and nonresponders to determine if the abundance of B. longum and capacity to synthesize folate predict vaccine immunogenicity (Aim 2). We will analyze the metabolic byproducts to identify if folate or other metabolites enhance vaccine response (Aim 3). Our unique team of experts in vaccinology, immunology, microbiology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analysis and interpretation of these immunologic and multi-omics data. Completion of the study will provide a comprehensive characterization of microbial and metabolic biomarkers of RV vaccine responses, paving the way for targeted immune augmentation strategies. Project Narrative Rotavirus vaccine was developed to prevent severe diarrhea and is especially important in low- and middle- income countries where 85% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur; unfortunately, vaccine efficacy is lower in these countries compared to high-income countries. This proposal will study infants from three countries with different socioeconomic levels and use sophisticated methods to determine how specific bacteria in the infant gut (microbiome) may change the response to the vaccine. If successful, this study will have a significant impact on this important public health disparity as a targeted intervention to improve vaccine response, even if small, could save tens of thousands of lives every year.",Gut Microbial and Metabolic Mediators of Rotavirus Vaccine Response,9862588,R01HD100542,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody titer measurement', 'Bacteria', 'Bifidobacterium', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diarrhea', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feces', 'Folic Acid', 'Folic Acid Deficiency', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lymphocyte', 'Maintenance', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Biotransformation', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nutrient', 'Oral', 'Panama', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Peru', 'Peruvian', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Role', 'Rotavirus', 'Rotavirus Infections', 'Rotavirus Vaccines', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Specificity', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Proliferation', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Vitamins', 'base', 'cell growth', 'design', 'folic acid supplementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'health disparity', 'immune function', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'infant gut microbiome', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'oral vaccine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'sample collection', 'socioeconomics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'stool sample', 'vaccine effectiveness', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine response', 'vaccinology']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,681780,0.006724065414537023
"Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers Chronic, non-healing wounds are common and costly complications of diabetes. Microbial colonization and biofilm formation are hypothesized to impair wound healing and contribute to severe complications such as osteomyelitis and amputation. Although all chronic wounds are colonized with microbiota, its importance, in the absence of clinical infection, is currently unknown. In this competitive renewal, we hypothesize that host response, wound healing, and clinical DFU outcomes are determined by 1) genomic diversification of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus; 2) commensal interactions with wound pathogens; and 3) commensal interactions with the host. In the previous cycle, we developed a shotgun metagenomic sequencing pipeline to analyze the microbiota colonizing neuropathic, non-infected DFU (n=100; the “DFU100” cohort) in a longitudinal prospective cohort study. We observed that strain-level variation of the wound pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was associated with DFU outcomes. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use a microbial genomic approach and matched clinical isolates from the DFU100 cohort to identify S. aureus genomic determinants of pathogenesis in DFU and their association with clinical outcomes. We also observed that species clinically regarded as “bystanders” (e.g. skin commensals, environmental contaminants) influence the virulence of wound pathogens and tune host tissue repair responses to promote healing in vivo. Aim 2 will determine if a skin commensal, Corynebacterium striatum, tunes the virulence of S. aureus and improves wound healing in murine and porcine models of S. aureus wound infection. Aim 3 is based on our observation that Alcaligenes faecalis wound isolates promote keratinocyte migration, cytokine secretion, and accelerated wound closure in a murine model of diabetic wound healing. We will establish the mechanism and therapeutic potential of A. faecalis-mediated host responses that lead to accelerated wound healing. The proposed research will use cutting-edge, cross-disciplinary approaches to investigate interactions between wound pathogens, wound “bystanders”, and the host; understanding these mechanisms will lead to improved DFU outcomes as our long-term objectives are to 1) develop novel microbiota-based interventions to improve healing that exploit microbial interactions with each other and the host; and 2) identify microbial biomarkers to classify patients at risk of complication. Chronic non-healing foot wounds develop in as many as 25% of persons with diabetes, and are often colonized or infected with microbes, though the role of microbes in healing and complications is unclear. The objective of this project is to establish the microbial basis of impaired healing and poor outcomes in diabetic foot ulcers by coupling cutting-edge microbial genomic and bioinformatic techniques with clinically relevant models. This knowledge will enable the development of novel microbiota-based therapeutic approaches and identification of patients at risk for complication.",Decoding the microbial burden in diabetic foot ulcers,9989920,R01NR015639,"['Adhesions', 'Alcaligenes', 'Amputation', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Complication', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Corynebacterium', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Foot Ulcer', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Family suidae', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Immune response', 'Impaired healing', 'Impaired wound healing', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neuropathy', 'Osteomyelitis', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Skin', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Staphylococcus aureus infection', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Wound Infection', 'Wound models', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chronic wound', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'diabetic ulcer', 'diabetic wound healing', 'foot', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'healing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'keratinocyte', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial genomics', 'microbiota', 'microorganism interaction', 'migration', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'phenotypic data', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'tissue repair', 'tissue-repair responses', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,511458,0.010179080854406825
"Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition Over 50% of postmenopausal women are affected by the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which includes vaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, and sexual dysfunction. Symptoms worsen if untreated and are associated with stress and depression. Estrogen decline in menopause is thought to lead to reduced glycogen accumulation in the vaginal epithelium and is associated with low vaginal Lactobacillus spp. levels in 50-80% of women. Lactobacillus spp. protect the urogenital tract from pathogens in part by producing lactic acid and for their anti-inflammatory properties, but whether lactobacilli are a marker for estrogen levels or play a functional role in GSM is unknown. Available treatments for vulvovaginal GSM symptoms have limitations. Some women are contraindicated for hormonal therapy or are concerned with side effects. Vaginal lubricants provide some relief, but they may be toxic to the vaginal epithelium, reduce lactobacilli, and raise urogenital infection risk. New therapies are needed. Vaginal microbiota are a plausible approach to treatment, however, probiotics alone have not proven effective. Vaginal microbiota co-vary with metabolite and immune profiles, and it is unknown how these molecular features relate to GSM. We hypothesize that core vaginal microenvironment biomarkers (VMB; e.g., microbial, metabolite, and immune profiles) reflect vaginal biological aging (V-BA) that is increased by menopause but may also be modifiable by other factors, such as lifestyle. Longitudinal studies are needed to identify core age-related VMB and determine how they relate to GSM. To accomplish this task, we will develop new statistical methods to combine complex longitudinal epidemiologic data with high- dimensional compositional data. We will leverage 2,301 archived cervicovaginal samples collected as part of a cohort of 812 women aged 35-60 years with visits every six months for two years (R01-CA123467). Specific Aims are to 1) quantify V-BA using VMB; 2) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between V-BA and GSM; 3) longitudinally assess the relationship of lifestyle factors on V-BA and VMB; 4) quantify longitudinal mediation by V-BA and VMB between lifestyle and GSM. Microbiota are already profiled by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing (R21-AI107224). Along with clinical, demographic, and behavioral surveys, we will 1) use cervical secretions and multiplexed bead-based immune-assays to quantify concentrations of 70 immune markers (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors); 2) profile metabolites from vaginal swabs (GC/LC-MS). This proposal is focused on developing and validating new statistical methods that refine and adapt modern structural modeling and microbiota compositional analyses. The novel statistical approaches will allow identification of vaginal microenvironment features which may lead to development of new and effective GSM treatments. These methods will also provide a new framework to handle missing data and confounding that has limited prior microbiome studies. Our team has the multidisciplinary expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, aging, gynecology, genomics, microbiology, and immunology required for a new systems-biology approach to GSM. Over 50% of postmenopausal women report genitourinary symptoms which result in detriments to their quality of life. Changes in the normal and protective vaginal bacteria (termed vaginal microbiota) accelerate in menopause transition for some women and have been associated with a higher burden of urogenital symptoms; therefore, we aim to determine how vaginal bacterial, metabolite, and immune profiles relate to genitourinary symptoms over time in a large study. The public health impact is to identify molecular targets of intervention which will improve postmenopausal vaginal health and lengthen women's healthspan, a key NIA mission.","Methods to Test Lifestyle, Vaginal Microenvironment, and Genitourinary Symptoms across Menopause Transition",10229293,R56AG068673,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Archives', 'Atrophic', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Body mass index', 'Cells', 'Cervical', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Dryness', 'Epidemiology', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Therapy', 'Estrogens', 'Funding', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Genitourinary system', 'Genomics', 'Glycogen', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Gynecology', 'Health', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Inflammaging', 'Intervention', 'Kynurenine', 'Lactic acid', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lubricants', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Menopausal Symptom', 'Menopausal Syndrome', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Outcome', 'Perimenopause', 'Play', 'Postmenopause', 'Prevotella', 'Probiotics', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Functioning', 'Sexual Dysfunction', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Streptococcus', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taurine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'chemokine', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'dietary supplements', 'epidemiologic data', 'healthspan', 'high dimensionality', 'hormonal contraception', 'hormone therapy', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'lifestyle factors', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'preservation', 'repository', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'urogenital tract', 'vaginal dryness', 'vaginal lactobacilli', 'vaginal microbiota', 'vaginal mucosa']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R56,2020,795662,0.0022925481701639803
"C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD PROJECT SUMMARY The Candidate is a postdoctoral fellow committed to developing an academic research group focused on applying bioinformatics to understand the pathophysiology of alcohol-related liver diseases (ALD). His previous and current postdoctoral work has given him the unique skillset to answer questions involving gene expression/regulation in the immune system. The Career Development Plan describes 2 years of mentored research wherein the candidate will develop skills in clinical immunology, generate the sequencing data outlined in the proposal, and learn leadership skills to transition into independence. The next 3 years, after obtaining an independent faculty position, will be dedicated to developing new data analysis pipelines and establishing cell biological and bioinformatics tools to understand gene regulation in the innate immune system, which will allow the candidate to establish future projects in ALD immunology. Research Plan: ALD is a spectrum of disorders that affect a growing number of people worldwide. Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that can increase the morbidity and severity of ALD disorders. In AH, the innate immune system is hypersensitive to microbial byproducts. Alcohol consumption causes gut-barrier disruption, leading to leakage of gut microbes into the portal circulation. The liver immune system is able to detect these microbes through pattern recognition receptors, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type Lectin receptors (CTLs). While TLRs have been well studied for their role in sensitizing the innate immune cells to microbial products, the CTLs have only recently been implicated in mouse models of ALD. CTLs are a large family of PRRs that sense a vast diversity of microbes, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Our work has found that many members of the CTL gene family are upregulated in the liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs of AH patients. CTLs were also upregulated in PBMCs in response to LPS/TLR4 signaling. We predict CTLs are upregulated in response to gut- derived LPS in order to increase sensing for other microbes that may be present in the blood, making this pathway a secondary innate immune surveillance pathway. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis in three aims to address the functional role and regulation of this immune surveillance pathway, and the mechanism by which it is exacerbated in AH. First, we will use PBMCs isolated from AH patients to measure increased sensitivity to CTL agonists, as well as micro-/mycobiome sequencing to determine what microbial byproducts were in circulation in patients. Second, we will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the different monocyte subclasses, variation in CTL expression, and how different cell types respond to CTL agonists. Third, because CTL genes are clustered in the genome, we will use scRNA-seq and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin) to understand co-regulation of nearby genes in the genome. Altogether, this proposal will further our understanding of CTL mediated immune surveillance in host/microbial interactions during AH disease progression and potentially identify new therapeutic targets to decrease inflammation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcoholic Hepatitis (AH) is a severe inflammatory disease that causes significant mortality among patients with Alcohol-related liver disease. In this project, we will investigate how the innate immune system and the micro- and myco-biome interact via a family of genes called the C-type lectin receptors (CTLs) to increase inflammation and disease severity among AH patients. The results of this project will expand our understanding of CTLs and immune surveillance, and provide new therapeutic targets for treatment of AH.",C-Type Lectins and Immune Surveillance in ALD,10020883,K99AA028048,"['ATAC-seq', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcohols', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'C Type Lectin Receptors', 'C-Type Lectins', 'CD14 gene', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elements', 'Ethanol Metabolism', 'Extravasation', 'FCGR3B gene', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Fungal Components', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunology', 'Inflammasome', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myelogenous', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Receptor Gene', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'TLR4 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toll-like receptors', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Transposase', 'Up-Regulation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cytokine', 'data analysis pipeline', 'dectin 1', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'fungus', 'gut microbes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'immunological diversity', 'immunoregulation', 'inflammatory milieu', 'liver inflammation', 'liver injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'mouse dectin-2', 'mouse model', 'mycobiome', 'new therapeutic target', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic fungus', 'prevent', 'receptor expression', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAAA,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K99,2020,123096,-0.003493801162814499
