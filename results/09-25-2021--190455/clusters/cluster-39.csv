"Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism PROJECT SUMMARY This R21 addresses a critical need for accurate and scalable screening tools able to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within the first year of life. This project will pilot an innovative digital phenotyping screening method, which uses computer vision and machine learning to measure synchrony within simple infant-caregiver interactions. Synchrony refers to the tendency for infants to spontaneously and dynamically coordinate their behaviors with their caregivers in time. This critical and early-emerging developmental process may provide unique and precise information about an infant’s risk for ASD, while also offering a lens for understanding early social interaction differences at the core of ASD. Significance: This project represents a paradigm shift in ASD screening, moving beyond behavior rating scales toward methods that are better suited to capture the subtle early indicators of ASD. Caregiver rating scales lack the granularity and objectivity necessary for detecting signs of ASD that emerge slowly and subtly throughout the first year. Approach: The interdisciplinary study team will leverage cutting-edge technology to objectively and granularly measure synchrony within 5-minute, play-based infant-caregiver interactions. Markerless computer vision will be used to quantify facial movements, captured unobtrusively with small, bidirectional cameras. The dyadic synchrony among infants’ and caregivers’ facial movements will then be calculated throughout the interaction, as part of an automated machine learning pipeline. Preliminary Data: We evaluated this approach in young adults with and without ASD during brief conversational interactions with research staff members. In a machine learning analysis pipeline, synchrony features classified diagnosis with 91% accuracy - significantly better than expert clinicians assessing the same videos. The same set of synchrony features significantly predicted symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that this method is effective for both diagnostic classification and dimensional prediction of individual differences. Importantly, the pipeline also classified diagnosis in children with similarly high accuracy, demonstrating the reproducibility of results across age groups. Aims. This project extends these computer vision-based methods to infants, with the overarching goal of evaluating their utility as a Level II screener for ASD. Aim 1 will evaluate the concurrent validity of our computational measures of interactional synchrony by evaluating their relationships with an established clinician-administered assessment of early ASD markers. Aim 2 will assess the utility of our interactional synchrony measure as a Level II screening tool at 12 months, by testing its ability to predict future ASD diagnosis with high specificity. Impact: This R21 will provide initial validation for a novel, computer vision- based screener for ASD in infancy. By targeting the dynamics of natural infant-caregiver interactions, this method has the potential to identify very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge. Moreover, this quick interaction-based screener would fit easily into the context of routine pediatric care, holding promise as a Level II screener deployable within a universal screening framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new method of screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy, leveraging computer vision and machine learning to develop a screening tool that detects alterations in the dynamic social coordination between infants and caregivers during brief, play-based interactions. There are currently no screening tools capable of reliably detecting ASD in the first year of life, and in particular, no tools based on direct measurement of behavior that can be feasibly deployed in primary care. This project addresses this critical public health challenge by examining an objective, granular, and scalable Level II screener, which has potential to lower the average age of diagnosis by identifying very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge.",Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism,9861937,R21HD102078,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior rating scale', 'digital', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'member', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'young adult']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2019,264000,0.1152109678811462
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families. These methods have potential to improve access to care and reduce the time lag between symptom emergence and diagnosis.",Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life,9860951,R01MH121344,"['4 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hour', 'Improve Access', 'Infant', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lifestyle-related condition', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computer program', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'validation studies', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,730137,0.16221305103490508
"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,9642534,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2019,835525,0.06865923205598375
"Deep Learning to Transform Clinician Autism Diagnostic Assessments and More NODA Telehealth system improves access to an autism diagnostic assessment by guiding families to share video clips of their child at home, so diagnostic clinicians can directly observe and ‘tag’ video of any atypical behavior, and if warranted, render a diagnosis. This system is evidence-based and has been commercialized, with several published studies to discuss the benefits. We now propose to improve this service by developing a Deep (machine) Learning capability in a software product called ‘NODA DL Classifier’ to help clinicians more quickly identify and better quantify typical and atypical behaviors on videos they receive from families. If successful, this NODA DL feature within the NODA system will have a profound impact in the time to reach a firm diagnosis, and then the capability could be used subsequently to effectively monitor treatment progress of individuals diagnosed with autism. In this project, we will determine how much DL improves the diagnostic process. In Phase I, we will test our use previously generated datasets to qualify and quantify potential benefits. In Phase II, we will conduct a clinical study to document time-savings and other clinical benefits. Our proposed NODA DL innovation represents a large step change in identification and then the care for ASD individuals, not an incremental one.

"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9791518,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,388353,0.08022011725093244
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",9906771,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2019,139681,0.04463068911811472
"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder.

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9600692,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,568221,0.02203049891123589
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9773231,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,799760,0.09479439448164691
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9692797,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,195916,0.07285509412342994
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9757857,F32DC017637,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Stuttering', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'caudate nucleus', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'language impairment', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'standardize measure']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2019,65354,-0.050136803290134736
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Neuroethics of Predictive MRI Testing: Parental Attitudes Towards Pre-Symptomatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Machine-learning-based classification of neuroimaging data (hereafter ML-MRI) to predict clinical diagnoses has increased substantially in the last decade. Despite the promise of ML for clinical classification and prediction, no work has been done to anticipate the ethical obligations and challenges that emerge when ML algorithms predict clinical diagnoses in pre-symptomatic individuals. Two recent reports from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) have exemplified the ML classification approach by predicting 24-month clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) from 6-month MRI data in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD. These preliminary results demonstrated—for the first time—the feasibility of identifying infants prior to onset of ASD symptoms, and raised critical ethical questions about whether and how to disclose predictive ML- MRI classification of ASD to parents of pre-symptomatic infants. The proposed research aims to investigate parental attitudes towards predictive ML-MRI testing in IBIS, and addresses a core principle of BRAIN Initiative: considering the ethical implications of neuroscience research. Aim 1 will review the bioethics literature on disclosure of results in genetic research, and identify overlapping and distinct ethical considerations for disclosure using ML-MRI vs. genetic testing for disease prediction. Aim 2 will use a theory-based approach to assess the attitudes of IBIS parents towards predictive ML-MRI testing through qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey. The knowledge gained through this research will help investigators make ethical decisions about disclosure in future neuroimaging studies of high-risk infants. Our long-term goal is to develop guidelines for navigating the unique ethical challenges posed by a new frontier in neuroimaging research: clinical prediction via increasingly powerful and sophisticated ML-based analyses of large neuroimaging datasets. The proposed research and training plan will leverage the resources of the University of Washington Autism Center, the Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics at Seattle Children’s Hospital, and the multi-site, longitudinal Infant Brain Imaging Study. The applicant will receive formal training in neuroethics, pediatric bioethics, and qualitative research methods, which will complement her prior skillset and prepare her for an independent research career investigating ethical issues in pediatric neuroscience. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning-based statistical techniques, recently applied to neuroimaging data, have allowed researchers to predict disease and disorder from brain data alone. Investigators working at this new frontier in neuroimaging research now face ethical challenges about whether and how to disclose a predictive clinical diagnosis to pre-symptomatic individuals. By combining bioethical theory with the perspectives of participants, the current research will generate new knowledge to guide ethical judgments about the disclosure of predictive diagnoses in future neuroimaging research.",Neuroethics of Predictive MRI Testing: Parental Attitudes Towards Pre-Symptomatic Identification of Autism Spectrum Disorder,10003829,F32MH118689,"['Address', 'Attitude', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Bioethics', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Face', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intention', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'University resources', 'Validation', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism onset', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical predictors', 'frontier', 'high risk infant', 'imaging study', 'interest', 'neuroethics', 'neuroimaging', 'parental influence', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recruit', 'systematic review', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F32,2019,66610,0.023990284966035114
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models.

"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,9746821,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,783284,0.12776941002196157
"Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder Abstract The goal of this R03 is to characterize longitudinal vocal development in infants and toddlers at risk for ASD and use these metrics to predict subsequent diagnosis and dimensional social/language abilities. There is a critical need for reliable markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can be used to detect the condition in infancy and hasten the onset of early intervention services. Preliminary data from our team indicates that infant vocalization features distinguish groups beginning in the first year of life, and account for significant variance in later diagnostic status and social/language phenotype. For example, we found that infants later diagnosed with ASD produce fewer speech-like vocalizations, fewer vocalizations directed toward others, more crying, and altered vocalization acoustics. However, the longitudinal development of these early-emerging differences has not been completely described, and while they hold promise as early markers, their ability to predict individual clinical outcomes has not been directly tested in a large sample. Therefore, the power of these early vocalization differences to improve clinical detection has not been fully harnessed. To address this gap, we leverage a large existing dataset collected through the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS; NICHD R01HD055741, PI: Dr. Joseph Piven). In this successful longitudinal multi-site study, infants at high and low familial risk for ASD completed video-recorded behavioral assessments at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, as well as neuroimaging at the same time points. Our research plan includes annotating infant vocalizations produced during these interactions using an expanded version of a coding scheme we have already developed, manualized, and trained annotators to reliably implement, and measuring the acoustic properties of each annotated vocalization. In Aim 1, we will use mixed models to analyze developmental group differences in vocalization features, determining which qualities distinguish groups and when. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning to test whether vocalization features produced during the first year of life can accurately predict diagnostic and social/language outcomes at age 2. This work will provide evidence of the clinical utility of infant vocalizations as pre-diagnostic behavioral biomarkers, setting the stage for subsequent studies of the relationship between early vocal behavior and brain development (measured using previously collected neuroimaging data from the same participants). The  Project Narrative This R03 proposal tackles a persistent public health challenge – detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during infancy – by identifying characteristics of infant vocalizations that predict whether a given child will develop the condition. To achieve this goal, we use computational linguistics and machine learning to analyze existing audio/video recordings from a large longitudinal cohort of infants at high and low risk for autism. This work has high public health relevance because it aims to identify markers that improve early identification of ASD, which is essential for initiating early intervention services and improving long-term functional outcomes.",Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder,9726509,R03DC017944,"['2 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Laughter', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biobehavior', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'language outcome', 'neuroimaging', 'peer', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'service intervention', 'social', 'success', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2019,88000,0.13358174134036369
"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9836112,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'trait', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2019,40450,0.01931154184077789
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9764485,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2019,75492,0.07629037946815549
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS.

Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes.

Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs).

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9607105,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'deaf', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phrases', 'programs', 'sound', 'statistics', 'virtual', 'visual motor', 'word learning']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,580188,0.07274049287217539
"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy.

"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9684602,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,608110,0.03823491492679872
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9753018,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'language outcome', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2019,268205,0.0502092887961655
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9788034,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'preservation', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2019,22217,0.07020309434500695
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern.

"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9729661,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,606922,0.045994708465339734
"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9776620,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,3605729,0.07699434602754598
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9613837,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multilingualism', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,268961,0.051622479908853415
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,9616310,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'movie', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2019,548461,0.038643475502380044
"Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD Abstract Language delay is often one of the first concerns of parents of toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and early language abilities predict broader outcomes for children on the autism spectrum. Yet, mechanisms underlying language deficits in children with ASD remain unspecified. One prominent component of linguistic behavior is the use of predictions or expectations during learning and processing. Several researchers have recently posited prediction-deficit accounts of ASD. The basic assumption of the prediction accounts is that information is processed by making predictions and testing violations against expectations (prediction errors). Flexible (neurotypical) brains attribute differential weights to prediction errors to determine when new learning is appropriate, while individuals with ASD are thought to assign disproportionate weight to prediction errors. These prediction deficits are hypothesized to lead to higher levels of perceived novelty, resulting in `hyperplasticity' of learning based on the most recent input. The proposed project will be the first study to examine whether language deficits in young children with ASD are linked to atypical domain-general prediction processes. Seven studies are proposed to address the following Specific Aims: (1) to determine the ability of toddlers with ASD to generate predictions compared to typically developing (TD) peers; (2) to establish whether toddlers with ASD exhibit hyperplasticity of learning relative to TD peers; (3) to examine the extent to which certain child characteristics predict individual variability in predictive behavior and hyperplasticity in toddlers with ASD; and (4) establish whether predictive behavior or hyperplasticity of learning on verbal/visual tasks predicts vocabulary and/or syntactic ability one year later in young children with ASD. The sample will be comprised of 75 ASD toddlers (three cohorts of 25 toddlers) and 75 TD controls distribution-matched on cognition (raw scores), SES, and sex. In this project we will utilize anticipatory eye movements (AEMs) and looking-while-listening (LWL) methods to investigate prediction in visual and verbal tasks in toddlers with and without ASD. Studies 1 (auditory) and 2 (visual) examine prediction as indexed by AEMs under conditions in which probabilities of the occurrence of events are relatively stable. Studies 3 (verbal) and 4 (nonverbal) will investigate hyperplasticity of learning in AEM tasks in which probabilities of the events change and predictions must be updated. Study 5 will explore hyperplasticity within the context of novel word learning using a LWL task. Study 6 will examine the relationship between child characteristics (cognition, language, autism symptom severity) and prediction. In Study 7, performance on Studies 1-5 will be used to predict language abilities in the same sample of toddlers one year later (from 18-35 mo to 30-47 mo) using both standardized tasks and an online incremental language processing task. All studies were developed to have minimal task demands in order to include toddlers with ASD across a wide range of functioning. Findings from this research will provide important new insights into ASD phenotypes and mechanisms underlying language development that could open new pathways for intervention. Project Narrative Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit challenges in numerous domains of functioning which often include significant impacts on language development. The proposed research investigates the assumption that individuals with ASD have difficulties making predictions, leading to atypical learning. Using methods designed to study learning in toddlers based on their eye movements, the proposed studies will examine links between language abilities and performance on verbal and visual learning tasks in toddlers with ASD and toddlers with typical development.",Prediction and Early Language Development in Young Children with ASD,9797068,R01DC017974,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Eye Movements', 'Generations', 'Hyperplasia', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'central coherence', 'cohort', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'novel', 'peer', 'sequence learning', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'syntax', 'theories', 'visual learning', 'visual processing', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,609106,0.1757073893736535
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD Abstract ! Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) show enormous heterogeneity in core language abilities, such as phonology and grammar. Over 50% of verbal children with ASD have borderline or impaired language. Deciphering how children with ASD learn language is important for understanding the heterogeneity of language abilities in this population, as well as for the development of more effective interventions for children with ASD who also have language difficulties. Based on decades of behavioral research in typical language acquisition, statistical learning is essential for encoding rich regularities and variability for first language development. Whereas statistical learning has been linked to typical language development and Developmental Language Disorder (DLD), existing studies investigating statistical learning in ASD lack consensus regarding whether statistical learning is impaired in ASD. Both the enormous heterogeneity of ASD population and the recently reported variation in one’s ability to learn statistics across linguistic and non-linguistic domains, as well as across sensory modalities, might have contributed to such inconclusive results. The overall goal of this research is to understand whether the language heterogeneity in ASD can be attributed to variations of statistical learning in a specific domain (linguistic vs. nonlinguistic) or modality (auditory vs. visual). Aim 1 proposes to first characterize the relationship between children’s language abilities and statistical-learning profiles across domains and modalities in a large sample of children with ASD (6 to 8 years old) and typically developing (TD) controls. Both groups will be evaluated using a novel web-based testing platform. Aim 2 will focus on probing the neural mechanisms during statistical learning in each domain and modality in ASD, and how relative strengths and weaknesses in the groupings are related to language performance. Comparing the neural responses during statistical learning tasks among children with ASD in relation to high vs. low statistical learning abilities grouped by domain and modality, the study will test whether language performance in ASD is related to domain-specific, modality-specific, or domain/modality-general neural substrates of statistical learning. The proposed study will pave the way towards a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in language impairment in ASD. The results will provide crucial preliminary data for future investigations aiming to elucidate the causal relationship between statistical learning ability and language learning in a longitudinal intervention study and how statistical learning profile is related to different genetic risks in children with ASD. Narrative: The proposed research aims to understand the cognitive and neural bases of learning mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of language abilities in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The findings of this work will characterize the behavioral phenotypes of statistical learning in a large sample of children with ASD and provide critical pilot data for the brain bases that constrain language learning in children with ASD.!",The role of statistical learning in the atypical language development in ASD,9813899,R21DC017576,"['11 year old', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundational Skills', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Environment', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'effective intervention', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'learning ability', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phonology', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'white matter']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R21,2019,152317,0.19448568065256167
"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9640127,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Differences', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,571164,0.09911462624387399
"Adapting Biomarker Assays for Individuals with Autism and Intellectual Disability Project Summary/Abstract The field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research lacks objective, sensitive quantifications of symptomatology with sufficient evidence to justify use as biomarkers in clinical trials. In the current proposal we investigate two promising markers, neural response to faces, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual attention to faces, measured by eye-tracking (ET). Published work and our preliminary data indicate that these measures: reflect clinically meaningful differences in the core symptoms of ASD, both by discriminating groups with ASD from those with typical development (TD) and by correlating with symptomatology in individuals with ASD; have strong test-retest reliability; demonstrate sensitivity to change in clinical status, both in the context of pharmacological and behavioral intervention; are collected by objective, automated tools not vulnerable to issues associated with inter-rater or inter-operator reliability; are minimally invasive and highly tolerable and therefore applicable across a wide range of ages and functional levels, with acceptable burden for participants and families; are collected using economical and accessible technologies that are scalable for large multisite studies with potential utility in the near term. Despite the promise of these biomarkers, their appropriateness in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability (ASD+ID) is poorly understood. In this application, we propose a novel integration of technologies and an innovative experimental approach to investigate these promising biomarkers in this critically understudied population. We leverage two complementary lines of research developed by the PIs: Dr. McPartland's Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT), a multisite study collecting large samples of highly reliable EEG and ET data in children with ASD, and Dr. Naples' suite of gaze- and behaviorally-contingent technologies permitting concurrent collection of ET and EEG data in individuals with severe ID. The proposed work will incorporate robust ABC-CT experiments into an innovative experimental approach to study 30 6-11 year old children with ASD+ID and a matched sample of 30 individuals with ID without ASD. We test the hypotheses that individuals with ASD+ID will display longer latency of the N170 event-related potential (ERP) to human faces and reduced proportion of looking time to human faces in static social scenes relative to individuals with ID without ASD and that face N170 and visual attention to faces will correlate with clinician and caregiver ratings of social- communicative function. This innovative project uses a suite of contingent technologies to acclimate participants to the testing environment and apparatus, to attenuate motion, to permit real time feedback on data quality to prioritize stimulus delivery, and to support post-processing of motion artifact using computer vision derived motion estimates. By adapting robust markers for administration to individuals with ASD and ID, this application holds promise for development of biomarkers viable in an understudied but critically important segment of the autism spectrum.

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9599448,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'human model', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'language outcome', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2019,506133,0.13510670296070226
"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9637451,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '5 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'multidisciplinary', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,648903,0.11599945466490404
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9759681,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2019,100000,0.16241770446333562

"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-modal partial least squared analysis to elucidate information linkage between complementary neuroimaging data sets. Research Design: We will analyze both cross-sectional data of young-adult (n=100) vs. middle-aged (n=120) ASD and NT groups, and longitudinal data of middle-aged adults in two year increments (n=120 participants; 360 data sets). Men and women will be similarly represented in groups (M:F ratio, 1.0 : 0.7). Aim 2: Identify the combination of behavioral measures in adults with ASD that best predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-task learning to determine the linkage between complementary behavioral data sets. Research Design: We will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data from Aim 1 ASD participants. Health Relatedness: These aims will have a substantial positive impact on health care quality and costs in the ASD community by vertically advancing our understanding of the unique cognitive and brain aging process, and laying the groundwork for delivering effective, precision medicine care to the growing and vulnerable population of older adults with ASD. Candidate Career Goals: Dr. Braden's long-term goal is to become a leading researcher in the neurobiology of aging in ASD through a multi-disciplinary program from basic science to translational treatment. Her short-term goals are to: 1) comprehensively describe age-related cognitive and brain changes in adults with ASD, and 2) identify targets for behavioral and neurobiological interventions and care plans tailored to specific cognitive needs of older adults with ASD. Career Development Plan: Building on her strong foundation in multi-disciplinary cognitive aging neuroscience, Dr. Braden will have intensive training in: 1) advanced neuroimaging analytics, 2) ASD phenotyping and interventions, and 3) professional and programmatic development for leading a funded multi-disciplinary research effort. Environment: Each training aim has an expert mentor across three local institutions with abundant academic overlap. Dr. Braden's home institution, Arizona State University, is one of the fastest growing research enterprise among all U.S. universities, and specializes in the neuroscience of cognitive and brain aging. She will also receive training at the Banner Alzheimer's Institute, an internationally recognized research and patient care program, and the Southwest Autism Research and Resource Center, an ASD community-based center of excellence.

"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9662003,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,802904,0.053172045018706
"Neuronal Correlates of Autistic Traits in ADHD and Autism ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered ""blind"" to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A substantial proportion of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have autistic traits for which clinicians have no effective treatmens. We propose to use advanced brain imaging methods to identify circuit(s) responsible for difficulties in recognizing facial expressions and relating socially to others.

"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome. Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction. Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.

"Deep Learning to Transform Clinician Autism Diagnostic Assessments and More NODA Telehealth system improves access to an autism diagnostic assessment by guiding families to share video clips of their child at home, so diagnostic clinicians can directly observe and ‘tag’ video of any atypical behavior, and if warranted, render a diagnosis. This system is evidence-based and has been commercialized, with several published studies to discuss the benefits. We now propose to improve this service by developing a Deep (machine) Learning capability in a software product called ‘NODA DL Classifier’ to help clinicians more quickly identify and better quantify typical and atypical behaviors on videos they receive from families. If successful, this NODA DL feature within the NODA system will have a profound impact in the time to reach a firm diagnosis, and then the capability could be used subsequently to effectively monitor treatment progress of individuals diagnosed with autism. In this project, we will determine how much DL improves the diagnostic process. In Phase I, we will test our use previously generated datasets to qualify and quantify potential benefits. In Phase II, we will conduct a clinical study to document time-savings and other clinical benefits. Our proposed NODA DL innovation represents a large step change in identification and then the care for ASD individuals, not an incremental one. It will lead to a significant improvement in both health outcomes and in reduced time required by clinicians or psychologists for office visits and for analyzing video data. This reduced time can be translated into reduced costs. We anticipate that significant commercial benefits will result from the use of our innovative computer methodologies. The proposed computerized Deep Learning (DL) function within our current NODA Telehealth System will have a profound impact in saving time to reach a firm diagnosis of individuals with ASD, plus provide other important benefits.",Deep Learning to Transform Clinician Autism Diagnostic Assessments and More,9465737,R44MH115523,"['Address', 'Applications Grants', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clip', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Current Procedural Terminology Codes', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Methodology', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychologist', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'human study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'prototype', 'satisfaction', 'telehealth', 'telehealth systems', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"CARING TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R44,2018,149124,0.05500487852918538
"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9524706,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design', 'wearable device']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,235500,0.006467969045858092
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9390046,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,578454,0.02203049891123589
"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder. The insights gained from this research will shed light on the biological mechanisms of this disease, thereby facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and treatment tools for autism.",Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism,9572935,F30MH115584,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Curiosities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Salvelinus', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'prognostic', 'risk variant', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2018,49524,0.06821340503675181
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9615416,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,841853,0.09479439448164691
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9527403,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,195916,0.07285509412342994

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9671829,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,194969,0.0623265809268306
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9596160,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,405254,0.03435519809039289
"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9522332,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,666236,0.059919396465953456
"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3).

"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis.

"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9263673,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,2297205,0.07248105052636028
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9470863,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,606853,0.03823491492679872
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term aim of the proposed research is to provide an account of how children learn the grammatical structure of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input, and also how these learning mechanisms may differ from those of adult learners. Distributional information is the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences. We hypothesize that learners acquire aspects of language structure from the statistics arising from this distributional information, such as which elements co-occur, what positions they regularly occupy in a word or sentence, and with what neighboring elements they frequently occur. Our program of research to date has focused on word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) and on word categories (how learners determine which words form grammatical categories such as noun and verb). This work has documented the power and robustness of infants’, children’s, and adults’ ability to use complex distributional information to discover these aspects of language. We now propose to extend our research in new directions, to examine two crucial aspects of learning higher- level linguistic structure. In Part 1 we study the factors that lead learners to generalize a novel inflectional morpheme (like –s for noun plurals) to novel words. In Part 2 we examine how learners acquire phrases and simple hierarchical structure in sentences, and we ask what leads learners to prefer the types of phrase and hierarchical structures that are most common in natural languages.  In our proposed studies we test our hypotheses using miniature artificial language paradigms that afford control over the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using only data from natural language learning. In each experiment, participants listen to utterances in a miniature language and then produce their own utterances or make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during the learning phase they hear only a sample of the possible utterances that are legal in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test, to determine whether learners generalize what they have observed to novel instances (and if so, to which types of novel instances). We have developed highly successful paradigms for engaging young children in miniature language studies, and we have demonstrated important differences between child and adult language learners in these studies. We will also present children and adults with comparable learning paradigms in the visual-motor domain, to assess the time-course of the learning process and the specificity or generality of the results using auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies will document the key variables that enable a distributional learning mechanism to acquire the structure of words (inflectional morphology) and sentences (phrase and hierarchical structure) and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and stimulus domain. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The study of age effects in language acquisition can help to determine the timing of optimal language input for bilingual children, deaf children, and children with communicative disabilities. Our findings on statistical learning of words, word categories, morphology, and sentence structure are also highly relevant to understanding language disorders, and our paradigms are widely used for identifying and treating children with difficulties, delays, and disorders of language acquisition. As research in language acquisition has moved from measuring stages of acquisition to understanding the processes by which languages are learned, our proposed studies will make important contributions to understanding where these processes break down and how principles of statistical learning can be used for treatment and rehabilitation.",Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning,9471944,R01HD037082,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age effect', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lexical', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phrases', 'programs', 'sound', 'statistics', 'virtual', 'visual motor', 'word learning']",NICHD,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,594063,0.07274049287217539
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9533881,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2018,266324,0.0502092887961655
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9747512,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2018,75492,0.07629037946815549
"Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder Project Summary/Abstract Currently, we lack an understanding of why grammatical deficits, particularly, are the primary deficit in developmental language disorder in children, and we also lack effective clinical treatment for these deficits. Recent studies have suggested that grammar may be impaired because of its statistical properties, which may be difficult for children with this disorder to learn or attend to. However, we do not yet understand what exactly about statistical input is difficult, and therefore face a gap in determining theoretical mechanisms that can explain the profile of developmental language disorder. In the proposed research, we explore the hypothesis that manipulations in the statistical properties of linguistic input may facilitate grammar learning in children with developmental language disorder. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims: We will compare learning for deterministic versus probabilistic statistical information to determine which type is more easily learned by children with developmental language disorder. We will compare learning for dependencies at different distributions to determine if children with developmental language disorder benefit from certain statistical structures. We will address these aims through two studies: an artificial grammar learning task and a sentence processing task with eye-tracking. These studies are innovative because they use tasks from basic research on language acquisition and processing to isolate aspects of linguistic input that could improve learning in developmental language disorder. Identifying the characteristics of linguistic information that are particularly problematic or relatively helpful for children with developmental language disorder as they learn grammar can help us understand where and how grammatical deficits in this population arise. Findings will be impactful because they may lead to more effective treatment through control of variables that can be simply managed in clinical settings, e.g. how often a word appears in one grammatical structure compared with another. The training provided in this proposal will provide theoretical and technical training in intervention research, working with individuals with developmental language disorder, and using real-time technologies to study language. Project Narrative Language development plays a critical role in a child’s ultimate academic and social success. A lack of effective treatment for the most prominent deficits in children with developmental language disorder represents a critical barrier to these children reaching their full potential as adults. By identifying and distinguishing the properties of language that are particularly effortful as well as those that are relatively easy for these children to learn, we can develop our understanding of learning in this disorder, and potentially make language treatment more effective.",Probabilistic learning in developmental language disorder,9609288,F32DC017373,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'educational atmosphere', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'farmer', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language processing', 'peer', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,F32,2018,58282,0.07020309434500695
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,9379468,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2018,340010,0.09677162700865645
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse.

"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9393259,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multilingualism', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,268713,0.051622479908853415
"Autoscreen: An innovative e-health solution for early identification of autism spectrum disorder Project Summary:  Early accurate identification and treatment of young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) represents a pressing public health and clinical care challenge. Given mounting evidence that early, accurate diagnosis of ASD is possible and very young children who receive intervention can demonstrate substantial gains in functioning, current American Academy of Pediatrics practice guidelines endorse formal ASD screening at 18 and 24 months of age. Ideally, this recommended screening would translate into early diagnosis and treatment for most children. Unfortunately, large numbers of children are still not screened for ASD; waits for specialized diagnostic assessment can be very long; and the average age of diagnosis in the US remains between 4 to 5 years of age. Further, groups from traditionally underserved communities are even more likely to be diagnosed at later ages. Delays in accurate diagnosis contribute to high levels of family stress and limit access to ASD behavioral intervention services, which are increasingly recognized as very important to children’s functioning. The current project tests a novel e-health system (“Autoscreen”) for rapid screening, diagnostic triage, referral, and treatment engagement of young children within community pediatric settings, with an embedded focus on reaching underserved populations. This tool fuses advanced computational strategies with expert knowledge and tools for ASD screening/assessment in order to realize an e-health application that not only provides support for enhanced screening across diverse communities, but also establishes a clear decision pathway for early, accurate diagnostic triage and meaningful engagement in early treatment.  We will integrate (a) our computational analyses of gold-standard assessments conducted across a very large-sample of toddlers with ASD and other developmental concerns with (b) a novel interactive assessment designed to target core areas of earliest ASD vulnerability, in order to create an e-screening application that can guide early action within traditional community pediatric settings. We will rigorously evaluate the feasibility, usability, compatibility, and potential utility of this tool in the current work. This evaluation will be conducted in order to ultimately create and test the efficacy of this innovative e-health product in terms of identifying and linking children with ASD more rapidly to meaningful interventions at young ages. We believe the potential market for such a system is quite substantial with common use developmental screening instruments identifying roughly 7-9% of children in first year of life. In this capacity, our tool will ultimately be designed as a practical, feasible, and reimbursable health-screening module for wide-scale use in community pediatric settings.

"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern.

"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9418062,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,571364,0.09911462624387399
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9422719,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '5 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Immunologics', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'multidisciplinary', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,649081,0.11599945466490404
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9560864,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'early screening', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'individual response', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2018,2585606,0.16241770446333562

This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion.

"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD.

"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,9452117,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'hands-on learning', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2018,175793,0.14318373346735286
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-modal partial least squared analysis to elucidate information linkage between complementary neuroimaging data sets. Research Design: We will analyze both cross-sectional data of young-adult (n=100) vs. middle-aged (n=120) ASD and NT groups, and longitudinal data of middle-aged adults in two year increments (n=120 participants; 360 data sets). Men and women will be similarly represented in groups (M:F ratio, 1.0 : 0.7). Aim 2: Identify the combination of behavioral measures in adults with ASD that best predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-task learning to determine the linkage between complementary behavioral data sets. Research Design: We will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data from Aim 1 ASD participants.

"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,9566985,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,154085,0.06533221333928234
"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9595884,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2018,3641916,0.07699434602754598
"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy.

"Neuronal Correlates of Autistic Traits in ADHD and Autism ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This study aims to conduct the first investigation of the neurobiological underpinnings of social communicative impairments, i.e., autistic traits (AT), in children with ADHD and ASD. AT, a key feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), occurs in 20-30% of children with ADHD. These children incur relatively elevated school failure and poor global functioning, highlighting the clinical significance of AT in children with ADHD (ADHD+AT). We aim to advance our understanding of AT across ADHD and ASD, applying state of the art brain imaging methodology as a first step in efforts to foster advances in treatment. Hypotheses emanate from the literature and our preliminary data. We aim to test that intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) between the fusiform face area (FFA) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) underpins AT across ASD and ADHD diagnoses. Specifically, we hypothesize: H1a: FFA-ACC iFC is reduced in children with ASD and in those with ADHD+AT, relative to children with ADHD but no AT (ADHD-AT); H1b: Across groups, weaker FFA-ACC iFC is associated with more severe AT. H2a: FFA-ACC iFC is positively associated with accuracy in emotion face recognition, and H2b: FFA-ACC iFC is significantly more related to accuracy on an emotion task than on a control non-emotion task. In addition, we will explore 1) similarities between R-fMRI and task-fMRI connectivity; 2) brain-behavior relationships beyond the FFA-ACC circuit, deriving whole-brain voxelwise R- fMRI metrics and iFC between regions-of-interest representing the `social brain'; 3) behavioral relations with structural connectivity indexed by fractional anisotroy, focusing on the inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, and other relevant tracts; and 4) data-drive approaches combining available clinical and imaging data to identify homogenous neurophenotypes regardless of diagnosis. Methods. We anticipate obtaining complete datasets from at least 70 children per group - ADHD+AT, ADHD-AT, and ASD (total N=210), group-matched for age, sex, full IQ, handedness and socioeconomic status. Assessments. A partial list includes: Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 (administered ""blind"" to all other clinical data), K-SADS and ADI-R interviews, Parent and Teacher rating scales. The emotion face recognition task, and the holistic configural face processing task will assess emotion face processing; a Go-No Go task, and motion tracking will measure attention and motion. Brain-behavior analyses will rely on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI), structural, diffusion tensor imaging and task- fMRI (matching face task). Significance. The study informs the neurobiology of a shared phenotype, and will bring the field closer to a neural stratification of individuals with AT a critical step for developing neuroscientifically-informed treatments. Additionally, we will share unidentified data with National Database for Autism Research yearly to accelerate scientific progress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A substantial proportion of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have autistic traits for which clinicians have no effective treatmens. We propose to use advanced brain imaging methods to identify circuit(s) responsible for difficulties in recognizing facial expressions and relating socially to others.

"Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children Project Summary Access to diagnosis of autism and to invaluable early interventional therapy is severely hampered by the imbalance between the number of children needing care and the inadequate number of clinical practitioners who can deliver that care. This numerical imbalance is unlikely to change in the near future, and therefore there is an urgent need and an exciting opportunity to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers of children at risk for or with a diagnosis of autism, and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Using machine learning and large-scale data mining, we have built a mobile system to quantify and track the severity of autism that takes only minutes of a caregiver’s time and that has promise for repeat use at home due to its speed, accuracy and mobility. We have concomitantly developed a machine-learning system for automatic facial expression recognition that runs on Google Glass and delivers real time social cues to individuals with autism in that child’s natural environment. Our goal in this research program is to work with our clinical colleagues at Stanford’s Autism Center to test and refine these complementary machine-learning systems for accuracy and optimal use by families and their child with autism from their natural environments. We will then combine the two systems in a multi-month longitudinal trial designed to harness our mobilized machine learning tool to quantitatively measure the efficacy of our Autism Glasses as a therapeutic assistant that functions in real time and within the child’s natural environment. Our proposed experiments with at least 40 subjects at risk for developmental delay promise to demonstrate how to leverage digital health technologies to improve, mobilize and quicken the detection and treatment of autism. The work also will result in a new and unique dataset that validates the ability to bring the social learning process outside of the clinic and into the real world, leading to a faster, more fluid way for children with autism to gain social skills. We also expect our work to show how measurable indicators of behavioral improvement during therapy will facilitate the process of tracking progress on an increasingly more granular scale, and hopefully set the stage for more effective, precise and personalized treatment. Project Narrative There is a growing and striking imbalance between the number of clinical care providers and the number of children at risk for or managing an autism diagnosis, creating an urgent need to innovate new methods of care delivery that can appropriately empower caregivers and that capitalize on mobile tools and wearable devices. Our research proposal is focused on building two complementary machine learning tools – one for rapid, mobile measurement of the autism phenotype and one for at-home social learning on Google Glasses – that we believe will open the diagnostic bottleneck and provide a valuable form of behavioral therapy that can be used at home and outside of the clinical setting.",Evaluation of machine learning to mobilize detection and therapy of developmental delay in children,9297669,R21HD091500,"['Address', 'Age', 'Android', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Therapeutics Program', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotions', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operating System', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'handheld equipment', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intervention program', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'social', 'social learning', 'social skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'trial design']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,196250,0.006467969045858092
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9191358,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,602469,0.02203049891123589
"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9272012,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,389936,0.0623265809268306
"Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations and genetic heterogeneity. This complex genetic landscape poses a serious challenge to eﬀorts to ﬁnd a relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in ASD. Therefore, the disorder remains poorly understand, and diagnostic and treatment tools are lacking. Though genetic overlap between patients is low, many mutations in autism likely aﬀect stereotyped biological pathways, resulting in subgroups of autistic patients with similar functional mutation burden. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that patients with functionally similar mutations can be clustered together in order to reveal previously unidentiﬁed groups that share both molecular mechanisms and disease related cognitive traits. This proposal ﬁrst describes an algorithm for genomic subtype detection of autistic patients using graph clustering and a novel distance function that is based on gene ontology, a database that describes the functional relationship of genes. Next, it is shown that resulting patient clusters are deﬁned by both unique and convergent involvement of genetic pathways, which provides insight into the variety of disease mechanisms that may be present in ASD. These potential mechanisms can be explored at the cellular level by connecting the clustering algorithm with data from ASD patient derived neurons. Finally, cluster membership is associated with diﬀerences in the clinical and cognitive variables, validating the relevance of the genomic subtypes. In addition, deep learning approaches to describe individualized clinical prediction are discussed. Genome clustering in autism is an important step towards deﬁning both mechanistic and clinical subtypes in this complex disorder, and this proposal addresses a growing need for algorithmic tools that connect genotype to phenotype in the context of heritable mental illnesses. Narrative Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism, remain a leading cause of global disease burden, due to a limited understanding of their fundamental causes. This application proposes a novel computational method that harnesses the power of genomics to identify groups of similar patients that suﬀer from autism spectrum disorder. The insights gained from this research will shed light on the biological mechanisms of this disease, thereby facilitating the discovery of new diagnostic and treatment tools for autism.",Genome Clustering for Clinical Subtype Detection in Autism,9470779,F30MH115584,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Curiosities', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Salvelinus', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'risk variant', 'social', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2017,49044,0.06821340503675181
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk).

"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9313700,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'indexing', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2017,267749,0.0502092887961655
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9307257,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,636163,0.03823491492679872
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9352674,F31DC015370,"['Adult', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'comprehension deficit', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'farmer', 'improved', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language impairment', 'natural language', 'novel', 'peer', 'social', 'sound', 'syntax', 'teacher', 'therapy design']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2017,24909,0.05679105346333352
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,9470704,F99NS105206,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F99,2017,39195,0.07629037946815549
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9242682,R03HD084941,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'educational atmosphere', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'infancy', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2017,78500,0.0818775027302204
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9297279,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2017,606922,0.045994708465339734
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,9178665,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Statistical Study', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2017,340010,0.09677162700865645
"Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, and the infrastructure developed in the CHILDES Project, the PhonBank database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for the study of phonological developemnt. PhonBank also provides the Phon program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 25 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",Extending PhonBank for Clinical Phonology and Speech Analysis,9234982,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Multilingualism', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'protocol development', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,293203,0.051622479908853415
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern.

"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9247655,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,616714,0.09911462624387399
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes.

"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes. To fill a critical gap in knowledge, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, including work that will enable improved early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of ADHD symptoms and improve quality of life for people with ASD.","Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment",9385863,P50HD093074,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'developmental psychology', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'model development', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'outreach', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'social', 'social attention', 'social engagement', 'social learning', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,P50,2017,2380519,0.16241770446333562
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,9244850,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'hands-on learning', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2017,175793,0.14318373346735286
"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,9431483,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alpha Cell', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2017,154085,0.06533221333928234
"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders ABSTRACT  Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome.  Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction.  Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. Project Narrative The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.

"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,9297357,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Music', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'portability', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,370333,0.12430231697167968

"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.                ",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9020029,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Only Child', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Sign Language', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'speech recognition', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,638494,0.02203049891123589
"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders. The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.",fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism,9002864,R01MH093510,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Euclidean Space', 'Fiber', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'cost', 'early onset', 'gaze', 'graph theory', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'novel', 'patient population', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,440666,0.06502236033142707
"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,9069097,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'graph theory', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'study population', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,465839,0.0623265809268306
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.            ",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9016694,R01DC015108,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Staging', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2016,565736,0.13510670296070226
"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism Spectrum Disorders This past year we have continued to evaluate the neural characteristics, and associated behavioral consequences, of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).   Prevailing theories suggest that ASD results from impaired brain communication due to aberrant timing or coordination of neuronal firing patterns (impaired synchrony). However, it remains debated whether synchrony abnormalities in ASD are among local and/or long-range circuits, are circuit-specific or are generalized, reflect increased (hyper-) synchrony and/or decreased (hypo-) synchrony, and whether they are frequency band specific or are distributed across the frequency spectrum. In previous studies, we used data driven techniques in conjunction with both fMRI and structural data to show that the abnormalities in ASD brain networks are most prominent within brain regions that support social functions. To provide an additional test of this hypothesis, as well as determine how oscillatory neural dynamics are affected in ASD, we recorded spontaneous MEG data in 17 high functioning adolescents and adults with ASD and 18 controls matched on age, IQ, and sex, and equated for motion during the scanning session. We used a method we recently developed to look at all-to-all synchronization across the brain in conjunction with data driven analyses to compare local and long-distance synchrony in a frequency-specific manner. We found that individuals with ASD showed local increased or hypersynchrony in the theta band (4-7 Hz) in lateral occipitotemporal cortex. We also observed long-range decreased or hyposynchronous activity in the alpha band (10-13 Hz) that was most prominent in neural circuitry underpinning social processing. The magnitude of this alpha band hyposynchrony was correlated with social symptom severity. These results suggest that while ASD is associated with both decreased long-range synchrony and increased posterior local synchrony - with each effect limited to a specific frequency band - impairments in social functioning may be most related to decreased alpha synchronization between critical nodes of the social processing network (Ghuman et al., 2016).  Our lab, as well as many others, have also documented deficient neural connectivity in the ASD brain via analyses of slowly fluctuating neural activity recorded while subjects rest quietly in the MRI scanner. However, the viability of this measure of neural connectivity as a diagnostic biomarker of ASD remains to be investigated. To address this important question we used a large number of machine learning classifiers to distinguish ASD from typically developing control subjects using resting-state fMRI data obtained from our own subjects (59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing males) and an additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset for replication. High classification accuracy was achieved through several analysis methods (peak accuracy 76.67%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed all findings based on measures of neural connectivity (peak accuracy 95.19%). Thus, while individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy based on their resting-state scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards. Nevertheless, the connectivity measures provided further evidence that ASD is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional brain networks, particularly those involved in social information processing (Plitt et al., 2015a).  Though typically identified in childhood, the defining social and communication symptoms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) persist throughout the lifespan. Although higher IQ, less severe symptoms, and stronger adaptive behaviors moderately predict positive outcomes in ASD, there is substantial outcome variability even among high functioning individuals with ASD (Farley et al., 2009). Thus, there is a critical need to identify predictors of adulthood outcomes in individuals with ASD.  The work described above identified three functional networks that best discriminated ASD from TD individuals (the so-called salience network, default-mode network, and the frontoparietal task control network (2).  In this study we used those networks to constrain our search for brain networks that were predictive of longitudinal change in symptoms, a realm in which resting state fMRI may be able to serve as a prognostic biomarker. Previous studies have found various behavioral assessments (such as intelligence quotient (IQ), early language ability, and baseline autistic traits and adaptive behavior scores) to be predictive of outcome, but most of the variance in functioning remained unexplained by such factors. We investigated to what extent functional brain connectivity measures could predict the variance left unexplained by age and behavioral measures of outcome; adaptive behaviors (as measured by the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, ABAS) and autistic traits (as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale) at least 1 year post scan (mean follow-up latency =  3 years). We found that connectivity involving all three networks was highly predictive of future autistic traits and the change in autistic traits and adaptive behavior over the same time period. Furthermore, functional connectivity involving the salience network, which is predominantly composed of the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate, was extremely accurate at predicting improvement in adaptive behaviors (Plitt et al., 2015b). n/a",The Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism Spectrum Disorders,9357304,ZIAMH002920,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dorsal', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intelligence quotient', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pervasive Development Disorder', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Questionnaires', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'developmental disease', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'information processing', 'instrument', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2016,1162902,0.12427105663034914
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",9116242,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2016,263788,0.0502092887961655
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8984169,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Apraxias', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discourse analysis', 'Educational workshop', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'lexical', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,270581,0.06711380934346638
"""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition"" ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A majority of children worldwide learn more than one language (Grosjean, 2010), yet theories of language acquisition treat monolingualism as the standard learning model. Bilingualism is highly common, but the mechanisms that drive bilingual learning are not yet well understood. In order to develop rich theories of language acquisition, it is necessary to include a full consideration of the demands of bilingual learning environments and how learners cope with these demands.  The proposed research project seeks to fill this theoretical gap by investigating bilingual statistical learning at the very early stages of languag acquisition. Statistical learning entails discovering structure by tracking patterns that are preset in the input. Statistical learning is a popular framework that has received a great deal of attention for its potential to explain how infants and children acquire many dimensions of linguistic structure. Infants are remarkably skilled at tracking regularities. However, the literatre has not yet addressed how bilingualism affects the ability to extract statistical regularities in linguistic input. The demands are substantially greater for bilinguals than for monolinguals. They must track two separate sets of regularities for every aspect of linguistic structure, from sounds to words to grammar. This research will examine two processes that are fundamental for early language acquisition, the ability to detect words in fluent speech and the ability to associate word forms with meanings. The experiments will address how dual language input affects infants' ability to perform these tasks. In addition, both monolingual and bilingual infants will participate, providing a window on how bilingual experience affects infants' tracking of regularities in dual languages. The project will also explore what cognitive processes support bilingual infants' ability to learn effectively in two immensely complex linguistic systems, focusig on how cognitive control and vocabulary composition relate to statistical learning skills in the laboratory.  In addressing a theoretical gap, the proposed research also has substantial significance for public health. This work will reveal mechanisms that infants use to learn and the conditions that support or hinder bilingual learning. These contributions have potential to affect the design and implementation of early bilingual education programs. In addition, this work will elucidate the mechanisms that typically developing infants use to acquire language, which has applied value for the study of language impairments. Understanding the underlying processes of typical development is crucial for understanding the development of populations who are not acquiring language on a typical course. It is important to know how learning typically proceeds in order to identify potential underlying deficits in learning impairments.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A majority of children worldwide are bilingual, yet there is limited understanding of how bilinguals learn. This work addresses a crucial gap in accounts of language acquisition and will inform programs for bilingual education. In addition, the research will support the search for underlying deficits in children with language impairments by characterizing the mechanisms that drive typical development.        ","""Mechanisms of Early Bilingual Language Acquisition""",9112198,R03HD084941,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attention', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Controlled Vocabulary', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Shapes', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'coping', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'educational atmosphere', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'infancy', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'phonology', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R03,2016,78438,0.0818775027302204
"Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment Project Summary/Abstract Statistical learning experiments have demonstrated that children and infants are sensitive to the types of statistical regularities found in natural language. These experiments often rely on statistical information based on linear dependencies, e.g. that x predicts y either immediately or after some intervening items, whereas learning to creatively use language relies on the ability to form grammatical categories (e.g. verbs, nouns) that share distributions. Distributional learning has not been explored in children or individuals with language impairment. The proposed research can reveal new findings regarding language acquisition and use in these populations. Proposed statistical learning deficits in individuals with language impairment (LI) are thought to have downstream effects causing poorer comprehension, but this relationship has not been experimentally shown. In this project, children with and without LI and their typically developing (TD) peers will complete an online comprehension task that employs natural language and an artificial grammar learning task that employs a made-up language. In the online comprehension task, participants use a computer mouse to choose a preferred interpretation of a sentence that is ambiguous, but that most adults would interpret a certain way due to the distributional properties of the verb, an effect termed verb bias. It has not been shown whether individuals LI are sensitive to verb bias effects, but we predict children with LI will be less sensitive than peers on the basis of previous work showing deficits with verb use and overall poorer linguistic experience in this population. In the artificial grammar learning task, participants will be tested to determine if they have learned the statistical regularities of trained stimuli and formed categories based upon these regularities. We predict TD participants will form more robust categories. It has not been shown whether individuals with LI are worse at utilizing distributional information from novel input, but poor performance on other statistical learning tasks by this population suggests a deficit. We will use measurements from both tasks to verify a relationship between them, for the additional goal of showing that language comprehension and statistical learning are related. This study will provide information about differences between children with LI and their TD peers in the ability to use distributional information from both accumulated and novel input. To this end, we will discover the role of input and experience in using distributional information in linguistic environments. Project Narrative The proposed project will provide information about the extent to which children with and without language impairment utilize distributional information in the input, specifically as regards to language. Problems with language learning are correlated with long-term academic and social difficulties, and a better understanding of how statistical information like words’ distribution is processed and utilized by individuals with language impairment can shed insight into the role of the input in language learning and use. This information could lead to intervention techniques that manipulate distributional information in order to facilitate language development and improve comprehension in children with language impairment.",Distributional Learning in Children with Language Impairment,9255906,F31DC015370,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nursery Schools', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comprehension deficit', 'experience', 'farmer', 'improved', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'language impairment', 'natural language', 'novel', 'peer', 'research study', 'social', 'sound', 'syntax', 'teacher', 'therapy design']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,F31,2016,31612,0.05679105346333352
"Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children. Poor language skills undermine academic success, which eventually impacts socio-economic outcomes and quality of life. When deficient language skills are first noticed in young children, there is relatively little time available to close the gap before they are faced with the increased language demands of formal education as well as the potential for academic failure. For the 8-13% of preschool children with impaired language skills, language treatments that are faster and more effective are urgently needed. Yet current treatments are notoriously protracted and expensive, and the effects of treatment can be weak. There is a growing call among scholars to step back from the business-as-usual approach to treatment research in favor of a systematic approach that integrates promising theoretical frameworks with experimental manipulations designed to isolate and enhance the effective components of treatment approaches. This grant proposes to leverage insights from the statistical learning perspective on language acquisition, which explains rapid, unguided learning sometimes even in the presence of impaired language. The grant proposes six treatment studies that target two groups of children with poor language skills. “Late Talkers” are children (ages 2-3 years) who are identified by their limited lexicons. Preschool children with specific language impairment (ages 4-5 years) show marked deficits in the use of grammatical morphemes. Parallel sets of studies with these two populations will determine the extent to which treatment variables enhance or detract from treatment efficacy across language domains. The goal of this work will be to identify specific treatment methods, derived from general learning principles, that clinicians can employ to enhance learning outcomes for children with impaired language skills.   Despite forty years of research on language impairments in children, information on effective treatment is sparse. The proposed studies evaluate treatment methods for vocabulary and morphosyntax deficits. The results should yield treatment procedures that can be imported into clinical practice.",Identification of treatment parameters that maximize language treatment efficacy for children.,9172394,R01DC015642,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Back', 'Businesses', 'Child', 'Cleaved cell', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Expenditure', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fathers', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Nursery Schools', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Parents', 'Population', 'Preschool Child', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Special Education', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'density', 'design', 'dosage', 'economic outcome', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'learning outcome', 'literacy', 'peer', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'specific language impairment', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment effect']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2016,606922,0.045994708465339734
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs. Carolyn Mervis and Cara Cashon, U. of Lousiville), and children with Cerebral Palsy (with Dr. Katie Hustad, UW-Madison).",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,8976620,R37HD037466,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Health', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'base', 'expectation', 'experience', 'innovation', 'knowledge of results', 'language processing', 'named group', 'natural language', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R37,2016,336609,0.09677162700865645
"Developing an Automated Emotion Training System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problems with nonverbal social interaction are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such problems include impaired ability to detect as well as express emotions, termed facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotion expression (EE), respectively. Computer-based, automated training systems to target these mechanisms hold tremendous promise for moving the field of interventions for ASD forward. We propose to develop a highly transportable, low-cost, and user-friendly technotherapy system that targets both FER and EE. This system [Facial Emotion Expression Training: FEET] will be entirely non-invasive and game- like, to make it appealing to the target population - children with ASD. This new system will be technologically sophisticated as it uses 3D sensors, allows for free movement of the user, and automatically adjusts stimuli presentation based on real-time feedback from the user (the child). Additionally, we are integrating best practices in the field of ASD intervention research, in that the system is individualized and delivery of stimuli will be scaffolded, based on the responses (accuracy) of the user. In this two-year study, we will first refine the computational system used by the system to maximize accurate computer emotion detection with children. We will then examine usability, feasibility, and assessment validity of th new system using a two-group study comprised of children with ASD (n=20) and children without ASD (n=20). This is not a treatment evaluation study, but rather a proof of principle study, the goal of which is to optimize the technology that will be used in intervention. The penultimate goal of this line of research is to develop an innovative treatment approach that targets core processes that underlie manifest social deficits in children with ASD. Such an approach has transdiagnostic appeal as poor FER/EE is not specific to ASD; it is commonly found in children with ADHD for example. This research is also necessary to establish viability of the system before proceeding to efficacy evaluation, which will be the next step. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problems with recognition and accurate interpretation of others' emotions as well as appropriate expression of one's own emotions are hallmark characteristics of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Computerized intervention may be useful in training these skills, as such training can be scaffolded, easily personalized to the needs of the individual child, and delivered in the comfort of one's own home thereby making it highly accessible and low-cost. We will develop a novel, interactive computerized system that will address emotion recognition and expression and evaluate usability of the system in children with and without ASD, in preparation for future clinical evaluation of this system as an intervention.",Developing an Automated Emotion Training System,9041646,R03HD081070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anger', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'animation', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'efficacy evaluation', 'emotional experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive therapy', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'peer', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R03,2016,73045,0.013201831229968167
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"HARE: Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of autism leads to earlier treatment, which is proven to have a major impact on outcomes. In spite of recent advances in early Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) detection, the average age of diagnosis in the US is still around five. ASD diagnosis is currently performed via behavioral assessment, which requires highly specialized training, is not widely available in rural areas, and may be applied inconsistently. The need for specialized training for the administration of behavioral assessment and the effort involved in individual assessments preclude large scale deployment of these diagnostic methods in clinics and pediatricians' offices as well as large scale population studies. The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is an early detection study at the University of Washington Autism Center which assesses behavioral and brain development in infants at high familial risk for ASD. Behavioral assessments include specialized observations of gross motor function, an area of development that is uniquely highlighted in the first year of life. This study along with others, highlight atypical motor development as the first step in the emergence of autism-related symptoms. Analyzing behavioral video data in order to assess/score individual subjects is a process that is time-intensive, subjective, and requires extensive training to attain reliability. We will build a Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) that leverages computer vision tools to automatically extract, quantify and classify known motor actions - from video datasets - adding a significantly more efficient and standardized method to augment the current diagnostic standard of care. In this Phase I proposal, we will: 1. Develop the HARE prototype: automatic segmentation of subject of interest; determination of 3D orientation; extraction of features that are used in classification of actions from a predefined set defined in the IBIS behavioral assessment battery; 2. Leverage the intermediate outputs of the AR engine in establishing techniques to detect and de-identify faces of multiple, closely-interacting human subjects in video toward further processing and data sharing; 3. Explore early markers to classify subjects, based on actions detected, into ASD and non-ASD groups and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the classification engine. This Phase I effort will pave the way forthe creation of an action-annotated video repository from HARE's action recognition output. The repository will provide a rich source of highly-accessible data toward training and further research discoveries. Finally, the HARE system can systematically identify new, previously unidentified motor actions that may relate to increased risk for later developmental difficulties, particularly ASD. These novel early risk markers - in combination with existing assessments - would allow reliable, earlier identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build an action-annotated video repository that will aid objective behavioral assessment of infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and serve as a valuable training tool.

"Quantitative Measurements of Cortical Excitability in Neurodevelopmental Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are characterized by abnormalities in baseline cortical excitability that are believed to be caused by an abnormal, system-wide balance between excitation and inhibition. Mounting evidence has linked baseline cortical excitability to abnormalities in the sensory systems. as manifested by both over- and hypo- reactivity to sensory stimuli and by the high prevalence of epileptiform EEG activity in the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD and ADHD. Sensory systems rely on a set of well-characterized network of mechanisms whose functioning directly depends on a precise balancing of excitation and inhibition. The aim of this investigation is to use sensory evoked responses as a means to quantitatively assess baseline cortical excitability in two common neurodevelopmental disorders, ASD and ADHD. These measurements will be made via Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials. Patterns sensory responses measured electrophysiologically will be compared to patterns of behavioral hyper/hyposensitivity measured via a well- characterized parental questionnaire and examiner-administered performance evaluations. These measurements will be obtained from 40 children with ASD, 40 children with ADHD and 40 matched controls. The immediate goal of the project is to determine whether specific patterns of sensory evoked potentials are associated with behavioral indices of disturbed sensory processing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop sensitive and objective measures of cortical excitability for use in classifying neurodevelopmental disorders. An ability to detect and quantify underlying alterations in cortical excitability in infancy and ealy childhood would be of significant value in the diagnosis, classification and treatment management of common neurodevelopmental disorders. The present proposal is a fundamental step toward the achievement of this purpose and this approach is consistent with the NIMH Strategic Plan for the development of new ways of classifying psychopathology based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.

"Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an NIH Pathway to Independence PI Award (K99/R00), entitled ""Brain systems underlying episodic memory for social stimuli in childhood autism"". The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the neural basis of aberrant episodic memory for social stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by life-long deficits in social interactions. Impaired episodic memory for events of social relevance has also been commonly seen in individuals with ASD and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding aberrant episodic memory, particularly as it pertains to social stimuli, has the potential to provie new insights into the nature and etiology of the disorder. The candidate will use state-of-the-art functional and diffusion tensor brain imaging in conjunction with novel memory paradigms and multivariate methods to compare the neural correlates of episodic memory for social and nonsocial stimuli in children with ASD and typically developing children matched on age, gender and IQ. Memory encoding, retrieval and consolidation processes will be examined. The Specific Aims are: (1) To investigate atypical brain systems underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval for social stimuli in children with ASD (K99 phase); (2) To investigate atypical brain connectivity underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval in children with ASD (K99 and R00 phases); (3) To investigate atypical brain systems and connectivity underlying episodic memory consolidation (i.e., long-term retention of memories for social stimuli after several days) in children with ASD, and to determine which memory processes and brain measures are the most reliable predictors of clinical and neuropsychological assessments of memory functioning and social deficits in children with ASD (R00 phase). Findings from this research will advance our understanding of the brain basis of episodic memory dysfunction and its contribution to social deficits in ASD. This knowledge will inform early intervention and remedial education in children with ASD. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education, training, and career development plan in the K99 phase to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ASD research, and multivariate pattern classification analysis of functional brain imaging data in conjunction with structural diffusion tensor imaging. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, and will gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ASD. This knowledge and skills during the K99 phase will enable the candidate to become an independent investigator and accomplish the follow-up innovative studies in the R00 phase. Accomplishing the proposed research in the two phases will allow the candidate to launch a rigorous research program by bridging clinical and cognitive neuroscience, and autism research, leading to a competitive NIH R01 grant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 88 children and are characterized by life-long deficits in social communication, making the disorder an urgent public health concern. Impaired episodic memory for socially relevant information is commonly seen in individuals with ASD, and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying impaired episodic memory for social stimuli in children with ASD will inform early intervention and remediation, eventually leading to improved long-term outcomes and quality of life for these children.",Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism,9014567,K99MH105601,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Remedial Teaching', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'bridge program', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'early onset', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory retention', 'memory retrieval', 'neocortical', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'white matter']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2016,123112,0.1064114015497895
"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9032537,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain overgrowth', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'middle childhood', 'phenome', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2016,670458,0.11599945466490404
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team. We present a highly integrated center with multiple collaborations across levels of analysis to further a strongly translational research strategy aimed at changing outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorders.        RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The UCLA Autism Center of Excellence is dedicated to identifying the causes of autism, discovering how risk factors translate into abnormal brain development, developing and validating novel interventions, and targeting the core deficits to change trajectories and outcomes in individuals with autism spectrum disorder.             RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence.

"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy. This work will advance our understanding of this disorder and its treatment and ultimately inform and guide personalized therapies.",Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism,9237585,R01NS035193,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Autacoids', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'forest', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,388857,0.11762495589500369
"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,9095902,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,372175,0.12430231697167968
"Neural Systems For Infant Sensitivity to Phonological Rhythmic-Temporal Patterning No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to understand how all infants discover the finite set of language units in their native language from the infinite combinations of sensory stimuli around them. Specifically, we explore whether infants are sensitive to the pure timing of the stimuli (the frequency), or whether they also are sensitive to linguistic information within the stimuli (alternation of phonetic-syllabic units). The findings will help us better understand [[on a modality-free level]] how infants begin life with brain mechanisms predisposed for discovering the core [[phonological]] parts of their languages, and how we can support clinicians in identifying infants at risk for phonology-based language and reading disorders.",Neural Systems For Infant Sensitivity to Phonological Rhythmic-Temporal Patterning,9193903,F31HD087085,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Beginning of Life', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Child', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Equation', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Impaired Persons', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Reading Disorder', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sign Language', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'gaze', 'hemodynamics', 'infancy', 'insight', 'language perception', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'phonology', 'reading difficulties', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'syntax']",NICHD,GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.05742768588436824

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders. The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.",fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism,8804285,R01MH093510,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Euclidean Space', 'Fiber', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'cost', 'early onset', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,439808,0.06502236033142707
"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial. The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism,8852186,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Ants', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Inferior', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Psychometrics', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biosignature', 'computerized tools', 'developmental disease', 'early onset', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'response', 'theories', 'translational study']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,709255,0.0623265809268306
"The Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism Spectrum Disorders This past year we have continued to evaluate the neural characteristics, and associated behavioral consequences, of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD).   Previous studies have suggested that ASD is associated with abnormal early brain growth.  More recently, cross-sectional studies suggest that cortical development during adolescence/ adulthood might also be aberrant.  However, longitudinal designs that follow the same individuals over time are needed to evaluate this possibility.  To accomplish this we analyzed structural MRI images acquired at least two years apart from our high functioning ASD and typically developing control subjects.  We found accelerated cortical thinning for the ASD group as compared to typically developing individuals, especially in left ventral temporal cortex.  Importantly, this accelerated cortical thinning was associated with impairments in everyday functioning and other social symptoms. These findings of longitudinal change extend prior cross-sectional studies by demonstrating increased cortical thinning in specific brain regions in ASD subjects during adolescence, thereby providing further evidence for atypical cortical development beyond the early years in ASD.  In another series of studies we explored the functional consequences of these structural changes using task-based fMRI.  We found that the neural circuitry associated with perceiving and understanding social interactions showed a lack of category-selectivity in ASD. Specifically, brain regions, such as ventral temporal cortex, that typically respond when viewing social, compared to mechanical interactions, responded equally strong to both types of situations in our ASD subjects. This finding suggests that ASD may be characterized by deficient neural connectivity between brain regions comprising a specific processing network or circuit.  Our lab, as well as many others, have documented deficient neural connectivity in the ASD brain via analyses of slowly fluctuating neural activity recorded while subjects rest quietly in the MRI scanner.  However, the viability of this measure of neural connectivity as a diagnostic biomarker of ASD remains to be investigated. To address this important question we used a large number of machine learning classifiers to distinguish ASD from typically developing control subjects using resting-state fMRI data obtained from our own subjects (59 high functioning males with ASD and 59 age- and IQ-matched typically developing males) and an additional age and IQ-matched cohort of 178 individuals (89 ASD; 89 TD) from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) open-access dataset for replication. High classification accuracy was achieved through several analysis methods (peak accuracy 76.67%). However, classification via behavioral measures consistently surpassed all findings based on measures of neural connectivity (peak accuracy 95.19%). Thus, while individuals can be classified as having ASD with statistically significant accuracy based on their resting-state scans alone, this method falls short of biomarker standards.  Nevertheless, the connectivity measures provided further evidence that ASD is characterized by dysfunction of large-scale functional brain networks, particularly those involved in social information processing. n/a",The Cognitive Neuroscience of Autism Spectrum Disorders,9152129,ZIAMH002920,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Pervasive Development Disorder', 'Process', 'Questionnaires', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'developmental disease', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'instrument', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'relating to nervous system', 'social']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2015,1125989,0.1203425734145789

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment. The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.",Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development,8852664,R01HD067364,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Assimilations', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'English Learner', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Orthography', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Writing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'bilingualism', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'literacy', 'longitudinal design', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'phonology', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories']",NICHD,"HASKINS LABORATORIES, INC.",R01,2015,576358,0.0560844022520393
"Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Typically developing infants acquire language at a remarkable rate despite numerous perceptual and cognitive challenges. Infants may begin to learn language by tracking regularities in their environment. Specifically, research suggests that infants possess powerful computational mechanisms that may support the segmentation of words from fluent speech and facilitate word learning. The problem is that there is little research on the extent to which statistical regularities support early language acquisition under the challenging learning conditions often faced by young infants. The objective of the proposed research is to advance integrative and comprehensive theories of infant language acquisition by assessing how statistical learning supports (1) speech segmentation and word learning in background noise, (2) infants' ability to encode lexical representations in long-term memory, and (3) infants' abilities to represent newly segmented words with the appropriate level and type of detail to facilitate subsequent language learning. Three Aims will be addressed across nine experiments designed to test how statistical regularities found in natural language input support resilience, longevity, and representational specificity within a developmental framework. Infants will be familiarized with a short natural Italian language corpus and then tested on their ability o either discriminate words that have strong versus weak internal co-occurrence patterns (8- and 11-month-olds), or associate those words with novel objects (17-month-olds). Experiments are designed to tests how infants cope with simultaneous learning challenges. We will test the predictions that strong syllable co-occurrence patterns will bolster (1) speech segmentation and word learning in noise and (2) long-term memory for newly extracted words, and (3) that infants' word form representations will become more robust and specific. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative language development. Individuals who are, for a variety of sensory, neurological, or developmental reasons, less adept at tracking and representing statistical regularities when faced with real-world learning challenges may be at greater risk for atypical language development. Results from the proposed research will be used to help generate and test hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed set of studies explores potential mechanisms underlying positive language outcomes in typically developing infants. Being at risk for atypical language development poses a major health concern. The results of the project will help us generate testable hypotheses about the causal mechanisms for specific language delays in atypical populations, such as for infants with hearing loss or infants who, for various reasons, receive sub-optimal language input during critical developmental periods, and will begin to address NIH's need for evidence-based research to guide clinical practice.            ","Infant statistical learning: Resilience, longevity, and specificity",8984582,R01HD083312,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Chiroptera', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'hearing impairment', 'lexical', 'long term memory', 'natural language', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'resilience', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'word learning']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R01,2015,241243,0.0502092887961655
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.","Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys",8851635,R01HD067250,"['Adult', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Benchmarking', 'British', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured football', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phonetics', 'Procedures', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Rivers', 'Role', 'Saguinus', 'Semantics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soccer', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Voice', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'lexical', 'man', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'phonology', 'preference', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2015,208800,0.03221985635028216
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,8787131,R01HD051698,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Impairment', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Site', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'computer program', 'developmental disease', 'digital', 'disability', 'improved', 'lexical', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,268514,0.06711380934346638
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Developing an Automated Emotion Training System ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Problems with nonverbal social interaction are characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such problems include impaired ability to detect as well as express emotions, termed facial emotion recognition (FER) and emotion expression (EE), respectively. Computer-based, automated training systems to target these mechanisms hold tremendous promise for moving the field of interventions for ASD forward. We propose to develop a highly transportable, low-cost, and user-friendly technotherapy system that targets both FER and EE. This system [Facial Emotion Expression Training: FEET] will be entirely non-invasive and game- like, to make it appealing to the target population - children with ASD. This new system will be technologically sophisticated as it uses 3D sensors, allows for free movement of the user, and automatically adjusts stimuli presentation based on real-time feedback from the user (the child). Additionally, we are integrating best practices in the field of ASD intervention research, in that the system is individualized and delivery of stimuli will be scaffolded, based on the responses (accuracy) of the user. In this two-year study, we will first refine the computational system used by the system to maximize accurate computer emotion detection with children. We will then examine usability, feasibility, and assessment validity of th new system using a two-group study comprised of children with ASD (n=20) and children without ASD (n=20). This is not a treatment evaluation study, but rather a proof of principle study, the goal of which is to optimize the technology that will be used in intervention. The penultimate goal of this line of research is to develop an innovative treatment approach that targets core processes that underlie manifest social deficits in children with ASD. Such an approach has transdiagnostic appeal as poor FER/EE is not specific to ASD; it is commonly found in children with ADHD for example. This research is also necessary to establish viability of the system before proceeding to efficacy evaluation, which will be the next step.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Problems with recognition and accurate interpretation of others' emotions as well as appropriate expression of one's own emotions are hallmark characteristics of people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Computerized intervention may be useful in training these skills, as such training can be scaffolded, easily personalized to the needs of the individual child, and delivered in the comfort of one's own home thereby making it highly accessible and low-cost. We will develop a novel, interactive computerized system that will address emotion recognition and expression and evaluate usability of the system in children with and without ASD, in preparation for future clinical evaluation of this system as an intervention.            ",Developing an Automated Emotion Training System,8889799,R03HD081070,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anger', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Feedback', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Happiness', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Sampling', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'animation', 'anxious', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'efficacy evaluation', 'emotional experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive therapy', 'interest', 'meetings', 'novel', 'peer', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'sensor', 'showing emotion', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NICHD,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R03,2015,74163,0.013201831229968167
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.",Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism,8841825,K23MH094517,"['Aftercare', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Day Care', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Strategic Planning', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cooking', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'early childhood', 'improved', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'joint attention', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2015,181319,0.13659199382996517
"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism. This research holds promise for discovery of gene-brain-behavior relationships, attained through integration of genotypic, EEG, and behavioral data.

"Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an NIH Pathway to Independence PI Award (K99/R00), entitled ""Brain systems underlying episodic memory for social stimuli in childhood autism"". The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the neural basis of aberrant episodic memory for social stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by life-long deficits in social interactions. Impaired episodic memory for events of social relevance has also been commonly seen in individuals with ASD and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding aberrant episodic memory, particularly as it pertains to social stimuli, has the potential to provie new insights into the nature and etiology of the disorder. The candidate will use state-of-the-art functional and diffusion tensor brain imaging in conjunction with novel memory paradigms and multivariate methods to compare the neural correlates of episodic memory for social and nonsocial stimuli in children with ASD and typically developing children matched on age, gender and IQ. Memory encoding, retrieval and consolidation processes will be examined. The Specific Aims are: (1) To investigate atypical brain systems underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval for social stimuli in children with ASD (K99 phase); (2) To investigate atypical brain connectivity underlying episodic memory encoding and retrieval in children with ASD (K99 and R00 phases); (3) To investigate atypical brain systems and connectivity underlying episodic memory consolidation (i.e., long-term retention of memories for social stimuli after several days) in children with ASD, and to determine which memory processes and brain measures are the most reliable predictors of clinical and neuropsychological assessments of memory functioning and social deficits in children with ASD (R00 phase). Findings from this research will advance our understanding of the brain basis of episodic memory dysfunction and its contribution to social deficits in ASD. This knowledge will inform early intervention and remedial education in children with ASD. The candidate will undergo a rigorous education, training, and career development plan in the K99 phase to increase expertise in clinical aspects of ASD research, and multivariate pattern classification analysis of functional brain imaging data in conjunction with structural diffusion tensor imaging. The candidate will be mentored and trained by leading experts in clinical psychology, psychiatry, developmental and cognitive neuroscience, and will gain critical experience in clinical assessments necessary for successfully working with children with ASD. This knowledge and skills during the K99 phase will enable the candidate to become an independent investigator and accomplish the follow-up innovative studies in the R00 phase. Accomplishing the proposed research in the two phases will allow the candidate to launch a rigorous research program by bridging clinical and cognitive neuroscience, and autism research, leading to a competitive NIH R01 grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 88 children and are characterized by life-long deficits in social communication, making the disorder an urgent public health concern. Impaired episodic memory for socially relevant information is commonly seen in individuals with ASD, and such impairments can be highly detrimental to successful social interactions and the formation of long-term social relationships. Understanding the cognitive and brain mechanisms underlying impaired episodic memory for social stimuli in children with ASD will inform early intervention and remediation, eventually leading to improved long-term outcomes and quality of life for these children.                ",Brain Systems Underlying Episodic Memory for Social Stimuli in Childhood Autism,8805345,K99MH105601,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Episodic memory', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Relative (related person)', 'Remedial Teaching', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Sensory', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'aged', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'early onset', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory retention', 'memory retrieval', 'neocortical', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'white matter']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2015,126252,0.1064114015497895
"Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of autism leads to earlier treatment, which is proven to have a major impact on outcomes. In spite of recent advances in early Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) detection, the average age of diagnosis in the US is still around five. ASD diagnosis is currently performed via behavioral assessment, which requires highly specialized training, is not widely available in rural areas, and may be applied inconsistently. The need for specialized training for the administration of behavioral assessment and the effort involved in individual assessments preclude large scale deployment of these diagnostic methods in clinics and pediatricians' offices as well as large scale population studies. The Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS) is an early detection study at the University of Washington Autism Center which assesses behavioral and brain development in infants at high familial risk for ASD. Behavioral assessments include specialized observations of gross motor function, an area of development that is uniquely highlighted in the first year of life. This study along with others, highlight atypical motor development as the first step in the emergence of autism-related symptoms. Analyzing behavioral video data in order to assess/score individual subjects is a process that is time-intensive, subjective, and requires extensive training to attain reliability. We will build a Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) that leverages computer vision tools to automatically extract, quantify and classify known motor actions - from video datasets - adding a significantly more efficient and standardized method to augment the current diagnostic standard of care. In this Phase I proposal, we will: 1. Develop the HARE prototype: automatic segmentation of subject of interest; determination of 3D orientation; extraction of features that are used in classification of actions from a predefined set defined in the IBIS behavioral assessment battery; 2. Leverage the intermediate outputs of the AR engine in establishing techniques to detect and de-identify faces of multiple, closely-interacting human subjects in video toward further processing and data sharing; 3. Explore early markers to classify subjects, based on actions detected, into ASD and non-ASD groups and evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the classification engine. This Phase I effort will pave the way forthe creation of an action-annotated video repository from HARE's action recognition output. The repository will provide a rich source of highly-accessible data toward training and further research discoveries. Finally, the HARE system can systematically identify new, previously unidentified motor actions that may relate to increased risk for later developmental difficulties, particularly ASD. These novel early risk markers - in combination with existing assessments - would allow reliable, earlier identification of ASD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to build an action-annotated video repository that will aid objective behavioral assessment of infants at risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and serve as a valuable training tool. We offer a methodology that can systematically reveal salient early motor markers that can result in efficacious screening of high risk infants.            ","Action Recognition System for Behavioral Assessment Training, Data-sharing, and Early Markers Detection for Autism Spectrum Disorders",8980858,R43MH107063,"['Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alberta province', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Siblings', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data sharing', 'design', 'high risk infant', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'interest', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'rural area', 'screening', 'social communication', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIMH,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R43,2015,360563,0.12121709837593428
"Quantitative Measurements of Cortical Excitability in Neurodevelopmental Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are characterized by abnormalities in baseline cortical excitability that are believed to be caused by an abnormal, system-wide balance between excitation and inhibition. Mounting evidence has linked baseline cortical excitability to abnormalities in the sensory systems. as manifested by both over- and hypo- reactivity to sensory stimuli and by the high prevalence of epileptiform EEG activity in the majority of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD and ADHD. Sensory systems rely on a set of well-characterized network of mechanisms whose functioning directly depends on a precise balancing of excitation and inhibition. The aim of this investigation is to use sensory evoked responses as a means to quantitatively assess baseline cortical excitability in two common neurodevelopmental disorders, ASD and ADHD. These measurements will be made via Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials. Patterns sensory responses measured electrophysiologically will be compared to patterns of behavioral hyper/hyposensitivity measured via a well- characterized parental questionnaire and examiner-administered performance evaluations. These measurements will be obtained from 40 children with ASD, 40 children with ADHD and 40 matched controls. The immediate goal of the project is to determine whether specific patterns of sensory evoked potentials are associated with behavioral indices of disturbed sensory processing. The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop sensitive and objective measures of cortical excitability for use in classifying neurodevelopmental disorders. An ability to detect and quantify underlying alterations in cortical excitability in infancy and ealy childhood would be of significant value in the diagnosis, classification and treatment management of common neurodevelopmental disorders. The present proposal is a fundamental step toward the achievement of this purpose and this approach is consistent with the NIMH Strategic Plan for the development of new ways of classifying psychopathology based on dimensions of observable behavior and neurobiological measures.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims at applying Steady-State Visual and Auditory Evoked Potentials to examine patterns of abnormal sensory processing in children with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

"Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a common set of diagnostic features that nonetheless vary substantially in severity in different individuals. There are also many co-morbid features ranging from developmental delay to epilepsy to gastrointestinal disturbances that further complicate the phenotypes of ASD. To discover and integrate multilevel phenotypic information that would allow definition of biological subtypes and potentially predict and facilitate optimal outcomes, the MIND Institute initiated the Autism Phenome Project (APP) in 2006. To date, behavioral, medical, immunological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data have been acquired on 279 children (189 ASD, 90 typically developing controls - TD) at 2-3.5 years of age. Of these, 210 (134 ASD, 76 TD) have received a second MRI scan one year later and thus far 142 (83 ASD, 59 TD) have received a third scan at 5-6.5 years of age. This program of research has identified a number of neurophenotypes of ASD related to abnormal amygdala growth and abnormal brain enlargement. But, do these brain differences really matter? An overarching goal of the proposed research is to determine whether identified neural phenotypes persist into middle childhood and are associated with the quality and severity of core and co-morbid behavioral impairments. A unifying hypothesis is that different morphometric patterns will be associated with clinical features and with the quality of behavioral outcome. We are particularly interested in whether there are different patterns of brain organization that may predict optimal behavioral outcomes in ASD. Using recently developed behavioral modification procedures that yield high quality MRI images from children at all severity levels of ASD, we propose to obtain an additional MRI time point and conduct extensive behavioral assessment of children enrolled in the APP when they reach 9-11 years of age. Based on previous return rates, we estimate that 195 children will participate. We will also recruit 100 new subjects into the APP program. This research would allow an unprecedented exploration of the relationship between brain development, behavioral abnormalities, and cognitive and functional outcome in children transitioning from early to middle childhood. We propose: 1. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of three patterns of early amygdala growth; 2. To evaluate brain and behavioral consequences of abnormal brain enlargement in early childhood; and 3. To identify a pattern of brain organization that is associated with optimal behavioral outcome. These projects are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 of the NIMH Strategic plan and address the 2009 IACC Strategic Plan crosscutting themes of Heterogeneity and Lifespan Perspective. They also contribute to the still unmet research opportunity for ""Multi-disciplinary, longitudinal, biobehavioral studies of children, youths, and adults beginning during infancy that characterize neurodevelopmental and medical developmental trajectories across the multiple axes of ASD phenotype..."". An important goal is to identify children who will need additional or specialized help to achieve the highest quality of life.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By studying nearly 300 children in the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project on three occasions from 3 to 6 years of age, we have discovered that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have various altered patterns of brain development. The current application seeks funding to bring the children back for another visit when they are 9-11 years old to see if certain patterns of brain development are useful in predicting which children have more serious symptoms of ASD, have higher levels of cognitive and emotional problems or, conversely, have optimal behavioral outcomes. One important goal is to find those children who will need additional or specialized help in order to achieve the highest quality of life.            ",Neurophenotypic Trajectories and Behavioral Outcomes in Autism Spectrum Disorder,8888079,R01MH103371,"['11 year old', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Years', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body Size', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'biobehavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive function', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'functional outcomes', 'gastrointestinal', 'infancy', 'interest', 'phenome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social communication']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2015,770599,0.11599945466490404
"Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mentored Career Development Award for Frederick Shic, Ph.D. This application will support my development as a scientist, giving me the tools necessary to advance as an independent investigator. For the last 9 years, I have been invested in understanding the early visual social-cognitive processes of infants and toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). I have developed new technologies and new approaches for analyzing eye-tracking data, drawing heavily on my experiences as a software developer and engineer. I have conducted several studies of atypical visual social cognition in ASD, charting early developmental trajectories of the disorder and offering new perspectives on the nature of information processing atypicalities in ASD. I bring a unique toolset and perspective to the field of autism research. I am currently building a lab centered on developing new, consumer- ready technologies that translate theoretical mechanisms of change and laboratory findings into clinically- meaningful tools for individuals with ASD. At the moment, the development of new technologies for helping children with ASD is progressing incredibly rapidly. Countless software applications, tools, and techniques have been proposed, and the breadth and pace of these new developments is breathtaking. My goal is to ground these new developments in an approach that leverages a rich understanding of developmental theory, brain development, and behavior. Although I have experience studying behavior, I will benefit from more directed and concerted instruction; to become an expert in developmental theory and methods for the study of brain development, I will need a specific, comprehensive program of guided education as well as hands-on learning opportunities. Combining an understanding of developmental cognitive neuroscience with technology development will result in a more theoretically complete picture of the processes of change and will accelerate methods for developing and refining new technologies. This approach will make me an extremely unique investigator in the field of autism research, allowing me to use my talents and abilities to discover more about the fundamental nature of atypical developmental processes in ASD and to develop new technologies to effect positive change in individuals affected by the disorder. To this end, I am seeking to deepen and broaden my understanding of 3 fields: (a) developmental cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging; (b) clinical/behavioral aspects of the developmental psychopathology of autism; and (c) statistical methods for combining and modeling complex data streams. In a keystone research experience, I propose to combine my expertise in eye tracking with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a neuroimaging technique applicable to individuals with ASD from infancy to adulthood and which targets the same underlying dynamic processes as the standard-of-field neuroimaging technique, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In my proposal, I will examine neural correlates of emotional biological motion processing in toddlers and children with ASD (N = 30) as compared to typically developing (TD; N = 30) and developmentally delayed (DD; N = 20) toddlers and children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal study uses functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and eye tracking to examine atypical neural and behavioral responses in toddlers and young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) presented with point light displays of emotional biological motion. This study will deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of deficits in ASD by highlighting deficits in basic social-emotional information processing, and may lead to the discovery of new markers for the disorder and new methodologies for parsing the vast behavioral and clinical heterogeneity of ASD.            ",Neural Correlates of Biological Motion Perception in Children with ASD,8891837,K01MH104739,"['3 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Perception', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'System', 'Talents', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Visual', 'Work', 'animation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'biobehavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'design', 'disorder control', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'gaze', 'infancy', 'information processing', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'social cognition', 'spatiotemporal', 'technology development', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,177012,0.14318373346735286
"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8852183,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,373818,0.12430231697167968
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first US estimates of ASD in an outpatient population and will greatly enhance community clinicians' ability to identify adults with ASD.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.        The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.          The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.        Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulties learning words, which negatively impacts academic performance, functional independence, and quality of life. Despite the importance of vocabulary development, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits. Furthermore, the overlap of language characteristics in children with ASD and SLI is not well understood. An understanding of language-learning mechanisms in children with ASD and SLI has important theoretical implications upon which effective language therapies rely. Although statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is accpted as a robust language-learning mechanism in multiple domains of language in typical development, very little is known about statistical learning in children with ASD and SLI. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning in word learning. Specifically, this study will assess how children link knowledge of native language sound patterns to meaning. The contribution of statistical learning in word learning in children with atypical language development will be assessed through three studies. Specific Aim 1 will investigate prerequisite skills in word learning. Study 1a will assess the use of statistical learnng through a segmenting task (i.e., segmenting sound units from a continuous speech stream with the use of implicit transitional probability cues) without word learning. Study 1b will test associative word learning of novel labels paired with novel objects without segmentation. Because children with ASD and SLI have difficulties learning words and have difficulties consolidating linguistic information in word learning, it is important to test component skills in word learning. Once prerequisite skills have been assessed, Study 2, addressing specific aim 2, will assess whether children with ASD and SLI are able to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and specific aim 2 is anticipated; however, comparison among the different groups will allow for identification of potentially different abilities in word learning skills in the two populations with atypical language development. Both implicit and explicit teaching and testing methods will be used to capture subtle real-time learning information while placing minimal behavioral demands on the children. Within- and between- group analyses will assess learning in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development. New statistical methods for analyzing eye-gaze data will be employed to address potential analytical difficulties given the heterogeneity and possible lack of within-subject stability in children with ASD and SLI. Additionally, because of known social deficits in children with ASD, the studies will use non-social tasks. Findings from this study will contribute important information to our theoretical understanding of language acquisition in children with atypical language development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI). Specifically, this study will evaluate two prerequisite skills for word learning, segmenting sounds into word-like units and mapping novel labels onto novel objects, to assess the ability to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A comparison of abilities in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development will be conducted to assess whether similar abilities underlie word learning across different populations, which will have important implications for theories of language development in children with ASD and SLI.                ",Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders,8667313,F31DC013485,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Bees', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Speech', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'classical conditioning', 'gaze', 'innovation', 'movie', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2014,27926,0.146021035635414
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage. The successful completion of this project will promote innovative treatments that advance the recovery of communication abilities and hence improve the quality of life of individuals with acquired language disorders.                ",Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach,8642022,F31DC013204,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agrammatism', 'Aphasia', 'Attention', 'Brain Injuries', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Communication', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Perceptual learning', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction Time', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'aphasia rehabilitation', 'aphasic', 'base', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language training', 'learning ability', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'sequence learning', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,35352,0.029410646529413415
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research  in  ASD  has  aimed  at  identifying  brain  level  endophenotypes  or  univariate  biomarkers  associated  with  the  different  subtypes  of  ASD  using  different  imaging  modalities.    DTI-based  studies  have provided insights into pathology-induced and neuro-developmental changes in white matter (WM)  architecture  and  structural  connectivity  for  ASD,  and  the  neurobiological  basis  for  neuronal  deficits  associated  with  ASD.  Specific  symptoms  such  as  LI  are  also  being  investigated  via  MEG  derived  temporal signatures based on evoked neuromagnetic activity during speech perception, processing and  cognition. Encouraged by the fact that DTI and MEG studies have individually been able to characterize  different aspects of ASD and some of its related symptoms like LI, in this proposal we aim at combining  the  MEG-based  temporal  signatures  with  the  DTI-based  structural  connectivity  signatures  to  create  a  multi-parametric  spatio temporal  signature  of  ASD  using  pattern  classification.  Creating  joint  multivariate signatures for an ASD population is rendered challenging by high heterogeneity imposed  by disease and development~ manifest as various subtle subtypes possibly associated with differential  neuronal deficits and the presence of datasets with missing modalities due to the inability of the subject  in completing both diffusion and electrophysiology protocols. In this proposal, we aim to address these  challenges, by creating quantifiable multi-parametric spatio-temporal markers of autism learnt from the  underlying pathology patterns of the population, by combining the MEG-based temporal signatures with  the DTI-based structural connectivity signatures using pattern classifiers created on an ASD population  with LI. We identify spatio-temporally compatible DTI- MEG features (aim 1) and create various multi- parametric pattern classifiers that will quantify ASD pathology by learning the population heterogeneity  despite partially missing data (aim 2). Via the application in aim 3, to an ASD population with LI as one  of  the  sources  of  heterogeneity,  we  will  have  created  classifiers  that  will  elucidate  he  importance  of  combination  diffusion  and  MEG  information,  identify  the  regional  and  connectivity  combinations  that  best  characterize  ASD,  and  provide  abnormality  scores  associated  with  each  subject  that  can  aid  in  quantifying  the  likelihood  of  impairment,  thereby  enriching  diagnosis  decisions.  The  classifiers  that  embrace  population  heterogeneity  and  missing  data  will  be  generic  and  flexible  in  applicability  to  any  population, as these can be easily retrained with new MEG and DTI features, and will aid future studies  that wish to incorporate spatio-temporal information.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This  project  aims  at  developing  multivariate  spatio-temporal  imaging  signatures  that  will  produce  quantitative markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder by integrating spatial features from diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI)  and  temporal  features  from  MEG  (Magnetoencephalography).  These  markers  will  provide an abnormality score for each subject by learning the underlying pattern of pathology which  can be used as an additional measure to quantify pathology thereby aiding in diagnosis, prognosis,   and  identify  modalities  and  regional  brain  patterns  that  best  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the disorder.              ",Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination,8679003,R21MH098010,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamencephalon', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'endophenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2014,202233,0.10717042429150087
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Phenotypic Characterization of Gene Disrupting Mutations in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorder. Efforts to identifying subtypes based on the behavioral and neural phenotypes have been unsuccessful, and the rarity of specific genetic events renders subtyping at the CNV or exonic mutation level challenging and exceedingly resource-intensive. However, exploring the impact of gene disruptions in common pathways holds promise for elucidating phenotypic subtypes and clarifying genotype-phenotype relations in ASD. Most importantly, the identification of pathway-based subtypes will advance translational goals of selecting interventions, defining treatment targets, and predicting outcomes. The current project aims to investigate the behavioral and neural phenotype, obtained through electroencephalography (EEG), in pre-identified individuals with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway. This project addresses the critical need to understand the pathogenesis of ASD by elucidating the relationship between ASD risk genes, brain function and behavior and the need to address the wide heterogeneity in ASD by careful subtype identification. We will include 60 participants with ASD with gene mutations in the beta-catenin pathway, 60 participants with ASD with gene disruptions falling in other pathways, and 60 participants with ASD without any identified CNVs or gene disrupting mutations along with 30 typical individuals. Given the role of beta-catenin in neuronal adhesion, synapse formation, and in the transcription of target genes linked to cell growth, differentiation, and migration, as well as preliminary evidence of behavioral disruptions in learning and memory, evidence of dysfunction of beta-catenin may be observed at both the behavioral and neurophysiological level. Electrophysiological measures will allow us to specifically address the brain systems related to learning and memory as well as those related to the core features of autism.

"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team. We present a highly integrated center with multiple collaborations across levels of analysis to further a strongly translational research strategy aimed at changing outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorders.        RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8723296,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2014,375283,0.12430231697167968
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies. If successful, the proposed study will provide the first US estimates of ASD in an outpatient population and will greatly enhance community clinicians' ability to identify adults with ASD.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.        The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.          The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.

"EEG Complexity Trajectory as an Early Biomarker for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG Complexity as a Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Personnel William Bosl (PI) Instructor, Children's Hospital Informatics Program (ChIP) Charles Nelson (collaborator) Professor, Harvard and Division of Developmental Medicine at CHB Helen Tager-Flusberg (consultant) Professor, Boston University Department of Psychology Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex, heritable disorders that have highly variable long-term outcomes. Research suggests that complex mental disorders such as autism are associated with abnormal brain connectivity that may vary between different regions and different scales [1]. In the autistic brain, high local connectivity and low long-range connectivity may develop concurrently due to problems with synapse pruning or formation [1, 2]. Estimation of changes in neural connectivity might be an effective diagnostic biomarker for abnormal connectivity development that leads to ASD behaviors. The electrical signals produced by neural networks contain information about the network structure [3-5]. Nonlinear signal processing algorithms [6, 7] can be used to compute features from the time series produced by the network to characterize the dynamics of a complex system such as the brain. Our hypothesis is that multiscale entropy (MSE) is one measure of signal complexity that will reveal distinct, measurable differences between normally developing brains and those that will eventually be diagnosed with an ASD. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify infants into one of three groups using MSE values: controls (CON), high risk based on having an older sibling with autism, but does not develop autism (HRN) and high risk and develops autism (HRA). Rather than mapping to these three risk groups, MSE values will be mapped to a severity score based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or equivalent assessments given to all infants in the study. Preliminary data using MSE to measure signal complexity shows a clear difference between normal controls and a group of infants at high risk for developing ASD based on family history (Bosl, et al., 2011). The change was particularly striking between 9 and 12 months of age when critical cognitive milestones are expected in normal infants. In the proposed study, we will also attempt to make predictions of outcome using MSE growth trajectories, with feature vectors composed of all values up to a specified age: 6-9, 6-12, 6-18 and 6-24 months. We hypothesize that the growth trajectories may be more informative than measures at one given age. To establish a baseline for comparison of predictions based on MSE, a similar prediction calculation using machine learning algorithms will be done with all available assessment scores, including ADOS, SCQ, Mullen and physiological measures such as head circumference. Even if a diagnosis of autism is not possible from assessment scores at one age before 18 months, it may be that the trajectory of assessment scores has predictive value. In all prediction computations, an estimate will be made of which variables contribute the most information to the prediction (whether EEG channels or assessment scores). Finally, correlations between MSE values and assessment scores will be determined in order to judge whether MSE measurements are proxies for assessment scores, or contribute complementary information, or neither. Early diagnosis and therapy are known to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of ASD patients. This project has the potential to enable early diagnosis of ASD, within the first year of life, and assess severity. If successful, this will also enable a new class of therapies aimed at averting the development of autistic brain functional tendencies before they are fully formed. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and machine learning to map MSE values, traditional scores and physical measurements to autism severity estimates, may be widely applicable as an approach for identifying quantitative biomarkers of other mental disorders. This may have particular value in resource poor regions where few professionals are available for complete behavioral assessments. PHS 398/2590 (Rev. 11/07) Page Continuation Format Page        Autism spectrum disorders are a complex and heterogeneous set of disorders that affect the developmental trajectory in several key behavioral domains including social, cognitive and language. The underlying brain dysfunction that results in the behavioral characteristics is not well understood. Because the proposed grant will leverage data from existing grants, it is uniquely positioned to explore novel diagnostic methods in a longitudinal study in a much shorter time than would normally be required. To our knowledge, our preliminary results are the first demonstration of the use of an information-theoretic value derived from EEG data, the multiscale entropy, as a biomarker for infants at risk for a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and the use of machine learning to discover patterns in signal features may not only enable early diagnosis of autism, but also provide a means of monitoring the effectiveness of early interventions.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.        Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.  The goal of this project is to develop and apply Natural Language Processing technologies to automatically extract ASD-specific language characteristics from uncoded, ""raw"" transcripts of natural language samples.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI) have difficulties learning words, which negatively impacts academic performance, functional independence, and quality of life. Despite the importance of vocabulary development, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits. Furthermore, the overlap of language characteristics in children with ASD and SLI is not well understood. An understanding of language-learning mechanisms in children with ASD and SLI has important theoretical implications upon which effective language therapies rely. Although statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is accpted as a robust language-learning mechanism in multiple domains of language in typical development, very little is known about statistical learning in children with ASD and SLI. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning in word learning. Specifically, this study will assess how children link knowledge of native language sound patterns to meaning. The contribution of statistical learning in word learning in children with atypical language development will be assessed through three studies. Specific Aim 1 will investigate prerequisite skills in word learning. Study 1a will assess the use of statistical learnng through a segmenting task (i.e., segmenting sound units from a continuous speech stream with the use of implicit transitional probability cues) without word learning. Study 1b will test associative word learning of novel labels paired with novel objects without segmentation. Because children with ASD and SLI have difficulties learning words and have difficulties consolidating linguistic information in word learning, it is important to test component skills in word learning. Once prerequisite skills have been assessed, Study 2, addressing specific aim 2, will assess whether children with ASD and SLI are able to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and specific aim 2 is anticipated; however, comparison among the different groups will allow for identification of potentially different abilities in word learning skills in the two populations with atypical language development. Both implicit and explicit teaching and testing methods will be used to capture subtle real-time learning information while placing minimal behavioral demands on the children. Within- and between- group analyses will assess learning in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development. New statistical methods for analyzing eye-gaze data will be employed to address potential analytical difficulties given the heterogeneity and possible lack of within-subject stability in children with ASD and SLI. Additionally, because of known social deficits in children with ASD, the studies will use non-social tasks. Findings from this study will contribute important information to our theoretical understanding of language acquisition in children with atypical language development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and specific language impairment (SLI). Specifically, this study will evaluate two prerequisite skills for word learning, segmenting sounds into word-like units and mapping novel labels onto novel objects, to assess the ability to map meaning onto newly segmented words. A comparison of abilities in children with ASD, SLI, and typical development will be conducted to assess whether similar abilities underlie word learning across different populations, which will have important implications for theories of language development in children with ASD and SLI.                ",Statistical Word Learning in Children with Language Disorders,8594469,F31DC013485,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Bees', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Communication', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Therapy', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Speech', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'classical conditioning', 'gaze', 'innovation', 'movie', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2013,29355,0.146021035635414
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.        The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering. The tools and methods used in this area can also be used for the study of adult language disorders such as aphasia, apraxia, and dementia, as well as for understanding normal and abnormal patterns of second language learning.

"Artificial Grammar Learning in Aphasia: An Implicit Learning Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Implicit learning procedures have the potential to greatly enhance language training, and yet have received little attention in the aphasia rehabilitation literature. Preliminary evidence of implicit learning ability in individuals with aphasia suggests that this approach could lead to less effortful language rehabilitation strategies, which may be used in combination with established methods of explicit treatment of grammatical ability. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to further the understanding of learning processes in aphasia, and to use that knowledge to engage patients in language learning strategies that will be most beneficial for language recovery. The specific objective of the proposed project is to test an implicit approach to artificial grammar learning in healthy and agrammatic aphasic individuals using a statistical learning paradigm. The central hypothesis is that implicit learning mechanisms, which are effective in deriving grammatical structure from statistical relationships in language, remain intact in individuals with aphasia, and that grammar learning is enhanced when passive language exposure is combined with active practice. The proposed research will be the first to test learning and short-term retention of an artificial phrae structure grammar under implicit learning conditions in individuals with agrammatic aphasia and healthy age-matched adults. Participants in this study will receive repeated passive exposure to the grammar on two consecutive days, and their acquisition and 24-hour retention of the grammatical rules will be evaluated by grammaticality judgment tests. The proposed research will also use the artificial grammar learning task with healthy young adults to test the relative effects of passive exposure to the grammar compared to active practice with feedback and a combination of both approaches. These contributions are significant because they are the first steps toward evaluation of an approach that utilizes patients' retained learning abilities and hence can improve the quality of life of individuals with aphasia.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research aims to further the understanding of language learning strategies that are effective and efficient for healthy adults and for individual with impaired language as a result of brain damage.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs. Jan Edwards and Julie Washington, UW-Madison), toddlers with Williams Syndrome (with Drs.

"Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research  in  ASD  has  aimed  at  identifying  brain  level  endophenotypes  or  univariate  biomarkers  associated  with  the  different  subtypes  of  ASD  using  different  imaging  modalities.    DTI-based  studies  have provided insights into pathology-induced and neuro-developmental changes in white matter (WM)  architecture  and  structural  connectivity  for  ASD,  and  the  neurobiological  basis  for  neuronal  deficits  associated  with  ASD.  Specific  symptoms  such  as  LI  are  also  being  investigated  via  MEG  derived  temporal signatures based on evoked neuromagnetic activity during speech perception, processing and  cognition. Encouraged by the fact that DTI and MEG studies have individually been able to characterize  different aspects of ASD and some of its related symptoms like LI, in this proposal we aim at combining  the  MEG-based  temporal  signatures  with  the  DTI-based  structural  connectivity  signatures  to  create  a  multi-parametric  spatio temporal  signature  of  ASD  using  pattern  classification.  Creating  joint  multivariate signatures for an ASD population is rendered challenging by high heterogeneity imposed  by disease and development~ manifest as various subtle subtypes possibly associated with differential  neuronal deficits and the presence of datasets with missing modalities due to the inability of the subject  in completing both diffusion and electrophysiology protocols. In this proposal, we aim to address these  challenges, by creating quantifiable multi-parametric spatio-temporal markers of autism learnt from the  underlying pathology patterns of the population, by combining the MEG-based temporal signatures with  the DTI-based structural connectivity signatures using pattern classifiers created on an ASD population  with LI. We identify spatio-temporally compatible DTI- MEG features (aim 1) and create various multi- parametric pattern classifiers that will quantify ASD pathology by learning the population heterogeneity  despite partially missing data (aim 2). Via the application in aim 3, to an ASD population with LI as one  of  the  sources  of  heterogeneity,  we  will  have  created  classifiers  that  will  elucidate  he  importance  of  combination  diffusion  and  MEG  information,  identify  the  regional  and  connectivity  combinations  that  best  characterize  ASD,  and  provide  abnormality  scores  associated  with  each  subject  that  can  aid  in  quantifying  the  likelihood  of  impairment,  thereby  enriching  diagnosis  decisions.  The  classifiers  that  embrace  population  heterogeneity  and  missing  data  will  be  generic  and  flexible  in  applicability  to  any  population, as these can be easily retrained with new MEG and DTI features, and will aid future studies  that wish to incorporate spatio-temporal information.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This  project  aims  at  developing  multivariate  spatio-temporal  imaging  signatures  that  will  produce  quantitative markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder by integrating spatial features from diffusion tensor  imaging  (DTI)  and  temporal  features  from  MEG  (Magnetoencephalography).  These  markers  will  provide an abnormality score for each subject by learning the underlying pattern of pathology which  can be used as an additional measure to quantify pathology thereby aiding in diagnosis, prognosis,   and  identify  modalities  and  regional  brain  patterns  that  best  contribute  to  the  understanding  of  the disorder.              ",Quantifiable markers of ASD via multivariate MEG-DTI combination,8517891,R21MH098010,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Nodal', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Speech Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamencephalon', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'endophenotype', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2013,257169,0.10717042429150087
"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Biomarkers of Developmental Trajectories and Treatment in ASD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence. The primary focus of the UCLA ACE renewal is to understand the relationship between aberrant brain development and core deficits in autism by identifying mechanisms relating genes to brain structure/function and brain to behavior, and to develop effective interventions based on basic experimental and clinical research findings that will change outcomes in autism. In five interdependent projects and cores, our center builds on our expertise in autism genetics, multimodal brain imaging, early detection and analysis of core autism features, and experience in implementing randomized control trials of novel interventions that target these core symptoms. In this renewal application, projects focus on defining longitudinal trajectories of brain and behavioral development in infants with multiple risks for autism (Proj I); infants and toddlers with early signs of autism (Project II), nonverbal school age children with autism (Proj III), and higher functioning children/ adolescents (Project IV), using a shared set of imaging, neurophysiological and neurobehavioral biomarkers, as well as genetic risk and expression analysis (Proj V) in longitudinal studies. This center is focused on understanding both early and later trajectories of emerging and developing functional connectivity and behavioral change in relation to variation in autism phenotypes, defining how genetic risks mediate both imaging and behavioral phenotypes, and altering trajectories through two separate treatments focused on core deficits in ASD, one targeted developing joint attention and social orientation in infants, and one focused on improving language nonverbal children with augmentative pharmacological intervention. Four cores support the scientific goals: an Administrative Core, facilitating scientific progress and providing data management/statistics support; a Diagnostic and Phenotyping Core; a Neuroimaging/Neurophysiology core, and a Research Education and Outreach core. The UCLA ACE benefits from our years of working together as a team. We present a highly integrated center with multiple collaborations across levels of analysis to further a strongly translational research strategy aimed at changing outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorders.        RELEVANCE: This is a renewal application for the UCLA Autism Center of Excellence.

"Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Currently, parent report screening tools (e.g., M-CHAT, CSBS) are the only standardized screening options available to pediatricians for the early detection of autism. As demonstrated in our previous work (the 1-Year Well-Baby Check-Up Approach, Pierce et al., 2011), such screens have valuable strengths, but also weaknesses, including the impact of parent characteristics on how they rate their child's behavior and high false positive rates. Autism is a disorder that has its roots in abnormal early brain development, yet early identification rests largely in the hands of parent report measures, rather than in the domain of more objective, quantifiable behavior. To move beyond parent report as the only early screening choice, novel procedures for screening must be researched.  During our last grant cycle we developed a novel eye-tracking test, the Geometric Preference Test for Autism (GeoPref Test). This simple one-minute test shows dynamic, colorful geometric moving patterns on half of a computer monitor and colorful active people on the other half. Of >440 toddlers tested using standard eye tracking technology, almost every toddler who fixated at high rates on the geometric patterns was ASD, and not typical or developmentally delayed. Thus, our laboratory experiments demonstrated exceptionally high, 99%, specificity of the GeoPref Test for detecting ASD. A low false positive rate is essential in a screening tool because false positives overload the system and create anxiety. Equally important in this heterogeneous disorder, the 1-min test identified 37% of all ASD toddlers. This is a larger percentage than any other early genetic, proteomic, neuroimaging or neurobehavioral screen, and it is fast, easy, and highly ASD specific.  Aim 1 will identify methods to integrate ASD specific test into clinical practice as a 2nd tier screen for babies who fail a routine 1st tier pencil and paper screen (i.e., the CSBS). Results will greatly improve the accuracy of early detection and speed referral of babies for diagnostic and treatment services. Using a portable eye tracker, 39 pediatricians will give the GeoPref Test in their office to toddlers who fail the CSBS who will in turn be referred to our Center for blinded diagnosis. This will be the first translation of an eye tracking finding on ASD into real-world clinical practice. In an effort to fully understand the clinical phenotype of ASD toddlers that ""fail"" the GeoPref Test, Aim 2 will use novel experimental tests, such as a test of exploration, as well as standardized tests such as the Mullen, to identify clinical profiles tha distinguish these toddlers from others with an ASD. Although the GeoPref Test identifies a large subgroup of 37% of all ASD toddlers, equally fast, and accurate tests are needed to identify the remaining ASD toddlers. Aim 3 proposes to develop new eye tracking tests, specifically novel social orienting and motherese paradigms, to detect these toddlers. Random forest classification algorithms will identify eye gaze signatures that best identify subgroups of ASD toddlers. All toddlers will receive a final blinded diagnosis at 30-36 months.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  In order to move beyond paper-and-pencil parent reports as the only option for early autism screening, novel techniques must be researched. Here, for the first time, this grant will translate an eye tracking test which was found to be highly accurate in detecting ASD - the GeoPref Test - out of the laboratory and into pediatric offices. Moreover, additional novel eye tracking tests will be developed and relationships between how a toddler performs on a given eye tracking test will be examined in relation to various clinical measures such as how a toddler explores their environment; understanding the clinical-eye tracking relationships is central to discovering the many unique subgroups that likely make up the overall ASD phenotype.            ",Early Identification of ASD: Translating Eye Tracking into Practice,8579445,R01MH080134,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child Behavior', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head circumference', 'Heterogeneity', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Language Tests', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'checkup examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computer monitor', 'forest', 'gaze', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'social', 'sound', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,387500,0.12430231697167968
"Clinical algorithm for identifying adult autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R34 application seeks support to refine and test a clinical algorithm for identifying autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in adults receiving outpatient psychiatric care. Evidence suggests that adults with ASD are overrepresented and underdiagnosed among individuals receiving psychiatric care. Adults with ASD may be medicated for disorders they do not have with medications that are not effective for treating ASD. They also may benefit from ASD-specific interventions that they do not get because of inaccurate diagnosis. ASD diagnostic tools are lengthy, most are validated only in children, and they require considerable training to administer correctly. Therefore they are not feasible for use with adults in community mental health settings. To develop a screening strategy appropriate for this setting, we will build upon our prior work in inpatient settings by partnering with Horizon House, a large community mental health organization in Pennsylvania, to identify adults with ASD in their care. We then will refine and validate our algorithm for identifying ASD in adults presenting for psychiatric treatment. Our goal is to use items readily available to clinicians, in combination with a brief screening tool, to accurately identify ASD in adults in community mental health settings, which would then lead to further diagnostic assessment. The specific aims of the proposed study are to: 1) Estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed ASD in community outpatient  settings~ 2) Compare clinical characteristics,  treatment and assigned diagnoses of adults with ASD with those of adults with other psychiatric disorders~ and  3) Develop and test a brief tool for community mental health practice to screen for ASD in adults. To determine cases of ASD, Horizon House staff will complete the SRS and the Autism Spectrum Disorders in Adults Screening Questionnaire (a shorter instrument used in similar studies) for adult clients with whom they have in-person contact during a 6-month period (n H 2000). Researchers then will conduct, on a  sample  of 450 subjects stratified by SRS score: 1) chart reviews to extract information  using  a  checklist comprising the characteristics found to discriminate between adults with ASD and other psychiatric disorders in prior studies (developmental history, neurological problems, substance use and criminal activity~ Appendix B)~ 2) structured clinical interviews using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Module 4, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders~ and 3) family interviews, using the Social Communication Questionnaire, semi-structured questions about early development, and the modified Family Interview for Genetic Studies. Case conferences will be conducted for all subjects to make a final determination of ASD. Once case status is determined, subjects with and without ASD will be compared on all variables using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision tree analyses to determine the most parsimonious creening strategies.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.          Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.

"fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This ESI / New Investigator clinician-scientist brings an expert team to test the altered brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism during infancy. We will conduct graph-theory-based network analyses on functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) data acquired in high-risk infants who are currently being studied in the multi-site, NIH-funded Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) study R01 HD055741: A Longitudinal MRI Study of Infants at Risk for Autism - Joseph Piven: PI. We will prospectively study diverging developmental trajectories for functional networks of brain regions in infants who do and do not develop an Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), during a suspected period of altered brain growth in autism, and prior to symptom expression. All four ACE data collection sites and their existing Data Coordination Center will participate. These efforts will provide longitudinal fcMRI data (scans at 6, 12, and 24 months old) in up to 664 high-risk and control infants (~15% of the 544 high-risk infants will develop an ASD). All four ACE data collection sites are already (as of May, 2010) - in advance of any dedicated funding, to ensure enough fcMRI data - acquiring fcMRI data on their subjects. Interfacing with the high-risk infant ACE structural imaging study and its supplements will allow us to build on existing infrastructure, save effort and cost, standardize collections, and merge databases. It also provides the potential for future genetic-functional imaging associations. Our fcMRI approach considers the problem of autism from the perspective of alterations in the behavior of brain-wide networks and changes in strengths of functional connectivity between and within rigorously defined sub-networks of brain regions. We believe this approach is more fruitful than those which consider smaller numbers of brain regions. We will additionally use a novel cortical functional areal parcellation routine (that Co-I Steve Petersen et al. have developed) to enhance the sensitivity of the infant fcMRI data analyses. Unique insights may come from comparing our network-based fcMRI analyses to the structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive phenotypic data generated by the existing ACE study (fcMRI acquired in the same infants). Once diagnoses are assigned in the ACE study, we will use a machine learning, multivariate pattern classification approach (Support Vector Machine: SVM) to explore the possibility of developing a diagnostic classifier for ASD. The eventual goal would be to train an SVM to predict which infants will and will not develop ASD, based on network properties of their fcMRI data, prior to the expression of symptoms. If successful, our proposed program of research could inform the future development of pre- symptomatic diagnostic tests for ASD, increase our knowledge about the neurobiology of autism, and provide methods for studying functional brain changes in response to interventions. These approaches could be adapted for the study of other neurodevelopmental and early-onset psychiatric disorders.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals. We propose to test the brain functional connectivity hypothesis of autism with functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) in infants who are at high risk for autism. If successful, we may contribute to the eventual development of pre-symptomatic diagnostic tests for autism that will improve early identification, which is critical for enhancing outcome in affected individuals. More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.           The proposed work is relevant to public health because autism is one of the most devastating psychiatric disorders of childhood, and disorders spanning the broader spectrum affect approximately 1/100 individuals.

More broadly, our proposed studies will also increase our knowledge about autism in ways that will complement future genetic, screening, and intervention studies.         ",fcMRI in Infants at High Risk for Autism,8237196,R01MH093510,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fiber', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'case control', 'cost', 'early onset', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'joint attention', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'social', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,584566,0.060902866630462835
"EEG Complexity Trajectory as an Early Biomarker for Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): EEG Complexity as a Biomarker for Autism Spectrum Disorder Risk Personnel William Bosl (PI) Instructor, Children's Hospital Informatics Program (ChIP) Charles Nelson (collaborator) Professor, Harvard and Division of Developmental Medicine at CHB Helen Tager-Flusberg (consultant) Professor, Boston University Department of Psychology Abstract Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex, heritable disorders that have highly variable long-term outcomes. Research suggests that complex mental disorders such as autism are associated with abnormal brain connectivity that may vary between different regions and different scales [1]. In the autistic brain, high local connectivity and low long-range connectivity may develop concurrently due to problems with synapse pruning or formation [1, 2]. Estimation of changes in neural connectivity might be an effective diagnostic biomarker for abnormal connectivity development that leads to ASD behaviors. The electrical signals produced by neural networks contain information about the network structure [3-5]. Nonlinear signal processing algorithms [6, 7] can be used to compute features from the time series produced by the network to characterize the dynamics of a complex system such as the brain. Our hypothesis is that multiscale entropy (MSE) is one measure of signal complexity that will reveal distinct, measurable differences between normally developing brains and those that will eventually be diagnosed with an ASD. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify infants into one of three groups using MSE values: controls (CON), high risk based on having an older sibling with autism, but does not develop autism (HRN) and high risk and develops autism (HRA). Rather than mapping to these three risk groups, MSE values will be mapped to a severity score based on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) or equivalent assessments given to all infants in the study. Preliminary data using MSE to measure signal complexity shows a clear difference between normal controls and a group of infants at high risk for developing ASD based on family history (Bosl, et al., 2011). The change was particularly striking between 9 and 12 months of age when critical cognitive milestones are expected in normal infants. In the proposed study, we will also attempt to make predictions of outcome using MSE growth trajectories, with feature vectors composed of all values up to a specified age: 6-9, 6-12, 6-18 and 6-24 months. We hypothesize that the growth trajectories may be more informative than measures at one given age. To establish a baseline for comparison of predictions based on MSE, a similar prediction calculation using machine learning algorithms will be done with all available assessment scores, including ADOS, SCQ, Mullen and physiological measures such as head circumference. Even if a diagnosis of autism is not possible from assessment scores at one age before 18 months, it may be that the trajectory of assessment scores has predictive value. In all prediction computations, an estimate will be made of which variables contribute the most information to the prediction (whether EEG channels or assessment scores). Finally, correlations between MSE values and assessment scores will be determined in order to judge whether MSE measurements are proxies for assessment scores, or contribute complementary information, or neither. Early diagnosis and therapy are known to significantly improve the long-term prognosis of ASD patients. This project has the potential to enable early diagnosis of ASD, within the first year of life, and assess severity. If successful, this will also enable a new class of therapies aimed at averting the development of autistic brain functional tendencies before they are fully formed. The novel methodology developed here, using complex systems methods to extract signal features and machine learning to map MSE values, traditional scores and physical measurements to autism severity estimates, may be widely applicable as an approach for identifying quantitative biomarkers of other mental disorders. This may have particular value in resource poor regions where few professionals are available for complete behavioral assessments.

"Characterizing mechanistic heterogeneity across ADHD and Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress in establishing the etiology of psychiatric illness is limited by the absence of objective biological measures able to detect and discriminate between disorders. This problem is particularly important in developmental disorders, where early identification could eventually assist in prevention of lifelong impairments. The two earlies onsets, most common and costly developmental disorders in child psychiatry are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A recent 2011 study, surveying the years 1997-2008, has now verified that 1 in 6 children have a developmental disability, a 17% increase over the past decade driven largely by increases in ASD and ADHD. These developments highlight the need for innovative approaches to address the underlying cause of these disorders. It is likely that the clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment.  Interestingly, an emerging observation regarding brain imaging in ASD and ADHD is that they often have the same atypical functional brain signatures. However, because these two syndromes are almost exclusively studied separately, it is difficult to determine atypical brain function that is common compared to what is distinct for each disorder. If we are to improve our understanding regarding the underlying etiology of these disorders, it will be necessary to study these populations simultaneously. With that said, simply comparing groups of children based on their DSM diagnosis is unlikely to suffice. The behavioral and biological heterogeneity within each syndrome further complicates the meaning of any given group difference found in brain imaging. Thus, progress in our understanding requires not only examining these disorders in the same studies, but also identifying how brain signatures relate to distinct behavioral components (i.e., endophenotypes) that span the syndromes.  Under this context, and consistent with NIMH's new strategic plan, Strategy 1.4 (also see RDoC), the current proposal aims to use resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) and structural connectivity (DTI) to identify brain signatures that correspond to fundamental behavioral components (executive, facial recognition, and affect recognition) found in ADHD and/or ASD. We also aim to develop integrated, multimodal sub-classifications (i.e. neurotypes) or ""biosignatures"" of these disorders with computational tools that include Graph Theory and support vector machine (SVM) based pattern classification. The potential impact of the proposed mechanistic categorization on future functional, genetic, treatment, and other translational studies of ADHD and ASD are substantial.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism. The work will also advance new approaches and methods to classify these disorders based on specific behavioral and neurobiological measures. The result from this study will advance our knowledge regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes of future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.              The proposed study uses relatively new and advanced imaging techniques (i.e. resting-state functional connectivity MRI, and diffusion tensor imaging), along with computational tools (i.e. Graph theory and pattern classification) to identify atypical brain physiology that is unique and shared across ADHD and Autism.

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.        Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.        The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.

"Statistical Word Learning and Non-Social Visual Attention in Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have difficulty learning words, which negatively impacts their functional independence and quality of life. Unfortunately, relatively little is known about the learning mechanisms that underlie these deficits, which has important theoretical and clinical implications. This study will address this gap in knowledge by examining the impact of statistical learning and non-social visual attention on word learning in children with ASD. Implicit eye-gaze methods will be the primary methodology because they capture real-time information about learning and attention. Because of their limited task demands, these methods are appropriate for children with a range of abilities. Many studies have focused exclusively on high-functioning children with ASD, thus limiting research and clinical implications for the broader population. The use of eye-gaze methodology in this study facilitates the inclusion of children with a broad range of language and attentional abilities.  Statistical learning (i.e., sensitivity to linguistic regularities) is a roust language-learning mechanism in typical development, but almost nothing is known about statistical learning in autism. Specific Aim 1 (Study 1) investigates a form of statistical learnin known as cross-situational word learning, which supports word learning in ambiguous contexts. Because children with ASD have difficulty using social cues to determine word meanings and thus experience many ambiguous learning situations, it is vital to characterize their cross-situational word-learning abilities. It is hypothesized that the ASD group will have impaired cross-situational learning abilities but that considerable variability will emerge. Specific Aim 2 will characterize this variability by examining two prerequisite skills--the ability to recognize recurring visual stimuli across contexts (Study 2a) and the ability to form a label-object association (Study 2b). A significant relationship between prerequisite skills and cross-situational learning is anticipated in the ASD group.  It is well known that children with ASD demonstrate atypical social attention (e.g., joint attention), but many children also demonstrate impairments in non-social visual attention. Specifically, many children with ASD show atypical attentional orienting (e.g., prolonged disengagement of attention) that may impact their ability to use cross-situational learning mechanisms. Specific Aim 3 (Study 3) will investigate the relationship between cross-situational learning and an established, independent visual orienting task. Study 4 will be an exploratory study that examines the relationship between visual orienting during the training phase of the cross-situational learning task (Study 1), and learning outcomes. This study is based on recent work with typically developing infants. Visual orienting, specifically disengagement, is expected to predict cross-situational learning in children with ASD in Studies 3 and 4.  Findings from this study will inform theories of ASD and language acquisition, and may have clinical implications for maximizing the effectiveness of existing treatment paradigms and designing new intervention programs to facilitate language acquisition in children with ASD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms that underlie word-learning deficits in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis, understanding, and treatment of developmental language disorders. It also has implications for the understanding of language patterns in stuttering, disfluency, aphasia, bilingualism, second language learning, and dementia. Recent computational advances now make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project now provides universal Internet access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not provided effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis. PhonBank seeks to bridge this gap by providing a new database on phonological development with transcripts linked directly to audio records. It also provides a program that automates creation and analysis of these new corpora. The construction of this database is being be supported by a group of 60 researchers and their students who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data are being structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of developmental disorders such as articulatory impairment, specific language impairment, and stuttering.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes. The results will inform subsequent studies of children at risk for atypical language development, a major public health concern. We are currently working with a number of relevant populations who are potential targets of future studies based on the experiments proposed in this application, including children with Specific Language Impairment (with Dr. Julia Evans, San Diego State University), deaf toddlers who use cochlear implants (with Dr. Ruth Litovsky, UW-Madison and Dr. Tina Grieco-Calub, Northern Illinois University), toddlers who are late-talkers (with Dr. Susan Ellis-Weismer, UW-Madison), children living in poverty (with Drs.

"Neural Predictors of Language Function After Intervention in Children with Autism    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !        Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children. This study proposes to couple behavioral testing with advanced electrophysiology to predict language outcomes after treatment in children with ASD. This study has the potential to improve our ability to predict language outcomes which, in turn, will allow clinicians to make more informed treatment recommendations and to provide more detailed prognostic information to patients and their families.

"Software to Enrich the Noun Lexicons and Lexical Learning of Children with Autism     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this project is to develop and field-test prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The target population for the curriculum will be 3-8 year old children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders, with language function in the range of 2-5 years. The curriculum will use a core noun vocabulary in training activities de- signed to address four interrelated goals: (a) train a basic noun vocabulary using both fast and slow mapping strategies; (b) enrich the semantic features of lexical entries by associating them with functional and/or descriptive information; (c) enhance lexical organization by using the core vocabulary in a series of categorization activities; and (d) expand paradigmatic schemas with training that associates basic level nouns with paradigmatically associated concepts. A subset of the curriculum was developed in Phase I and used in iterative testing with subjects in the target populations. It was found that even low language functioning children with ASD were able to use the prototype materials as intended and acquire or demonstrate knowledge of fast mapping, the vocabulary items, their categories, and their semantic associations. In Phase II the knowledge gained in Phase I will be used to improve and expand the curriculum into a prototype that covers 220 Target Nouns (110 associated pairs) with at least 10 superordinate noun categories. The prototype will include a unique integrated expert curriculum control system that includes probe tests to establish appropriate entry points into the curriculum, and will provide highly individualized and efficient language instruction in appropriate activities with proper instructional support. The prototype will be used in a 12-week field test in a public school distrit to evaluate its effectiveness when used by children with ASD and language impairments under natural conditions. Dependent measures will include pre- and post-intervention measures of receptive and expressive language status.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Despite extensive incidental exposure to language, many children with ASD have a markedly limited vocabulary and are clearly in need of formal remediation. The goal of this project is to develop a curriculum and prototype software for a research-based vocabulary development program featuring a combined lexical-cognitive approach to noun acquisition. The curriculum will focus on helping children to develop the learning processes necessary for efficient lexical acquisition and organization, and on laying the groundwork for a rich and semantically well organized conceptual framework. This will provide a cost effective means to promote early language and cognitive development in children with ASD as well as a broad range of other children with language disorders.              Impaired language is recognized as one of the hallmarks of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

"Computational characterization of language use in autism spectrum disorder    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yet, what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown. An important obstacle for the study of language in any disorder is that conventional structured instruments (i.e., instruments consisting of a sequence of items, each eliciting a - typically brief - response, such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals [CELF]) may not provide adequate breadth of information: Analysis of natural language samples is required  The proposed research will build on recent progress in ""Natural Language Processing"" (NLP) technology, an area of Computer Science concerned with computational analysis of text. The goal of the proposed research is to develop and validate new NLP based methods that automatically measure language characteristics of ASD based on raw (i.e., not coded) transcripts of natural language samples. The objective is to improve the analysis of natural language samples by enhancing efficiency, reliability, and richness of information extracted.  Data on three groups of children ages four to eight will be analyzed, obtained from an earlier study: ASD, SLI, and typically developing children.  If successful, the new methods will have important impacts on research and clinical practice for ASD and for other disorders in which language is affected, by enabling analysis of more representative and ecologically valid natural language samples as well as by creating opportunities for discovery of currently unknown language characteristics of ASD by the effortless extraction of numerous language features.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although atypical or impaired language is one of the core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), what the precise characteristics of language are in ASD and how they differ from those in other disorders such as Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is still substantially unknown, in part due to the paucity of instruments for the analysis of natural language samples.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,8097952,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2011,14727,0.06658580926832647
"Neurocognitive determinants of adolescent second language literacy development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The problem of bilingual education has become especially acute in light of globalization, where an increasing number of countries are faced with multilingual societies. In the United States, the educational challenges associated with integrating non-native populations into society are particularly challenging for the significant cohort of language-minority individuals who come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. The proposed project comprises a comprehensive investigation of the neurocognitive parameters that affect how adolescents acquire and learn to read a new language. The project will employ a longitudinal design in which we will recruit cohorts of adolescents ranging from a basic to medium literacy level in a second language (L2) and track skill development with both behavioral and fMRI measures over 24 months. Cohorts will be recruited in both Israel and the U.S.; thus, each language will serve as both L2 and L1. Specific aims are: 1) To investigate how learning to read in L2 is jointly determined by the linguistic structure of L1 and by individual differences in neurocognitive capacities of the reader; 2) To investigate whether acquiring reading fluency in a second language necessarily depends on acquiring ""native- like"" neurocognitive markers; and 3) To investigate the linguistic and general neurocognitive consequences of learning a new set of statistical regularities in L2. In addition, a cross-sectional fourth aim contrasts Hebrew vs. Spanish as L1 in order to assess both the generality of findings from Hebrew and investigate the impact of qualitative differences in the underlying linguistic structures of an L1 on neurocognitive indices of reading English. This proposed research will directly inform theories of second language learning, and holds promise to inform research on optimal approaches to second language curriculum development. Moreover, the focus on individual differences in L2 learning, at the level of brain and behavior, will yield new insights into challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and linguistic environment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured. By exploring how differences in language characteristics, in conjunction with neurocognitive individual differences, shape the trajectory of acquiring literacy skills in a new language and how those skills, in turn, impact native language performance, this proposed research aims to provide new understanding of challenges to second language literacy acquisition, given the characteristics of an individual's native language and language environment.           The proposed research will contribute important foundational knowledge about second language literacy development that will inform educational and health issues in an increasingly multilingual society in which many learners come to the task of acquiring a new language after the acquisition of literacy in L1 has matured.

"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,8042604,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2011,291831,0.054272973042554074
"Statistical learning of multiple patterns in infants, adults, and monkeys    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the present grant application is to understand how a naive learner collects distributional information from the environment and makes an implicit decision that the corpus of input contains either a single structure or multiple structures. Mature learners are incredibly facile at interpreting information in a context-specific manner, thereby partitioning the input into two or more sub-structures. We will investigate this question of context-specific statistical learning by studying two types of naove learners - human infants and tamarin monkeys - as well as mature adults. The specific objective of the proposed research is to determine whether and how infants learn that there are multiple patterns of information embedded in streams of speech, or that there are multiple words that refer to the same object, and to determine whether context-specific statistical learning has species-specific biases. Two types of experimental designs will be used to study context-specific statistical learning. The first uses a single change in the underlying structure. A variety of contextual cues will be introduced to signal that the underlying structure has undergone a change, and the dependent measure is whether the learner has acquired the first, the second, both the first and the second, or neither structures. The second design uses two alternating structures that are signaled by a variety of stimulus cues to partition the two underlying structures. It is important to note that in both of these designs, if the learner aggregates the structural information across the entire corpus, rather than partitioning the corpus into two subsets, no learning is possible. Thus, these designs test the ability of the learner to extract the contextual cues that partition the input into subsets. The implications of the proposed studies are fundamental to any theory of learning, but particularly to the kind of implicit (passive exposure) statistical learning that is thought to characterize much of early human development in many domains. Infants must learn - by a combination of sensitivity to distributional patterns and innate biases - that patterns of information are context-specific, as in the case of bilingualism. Our proposed experiments will extend our recent studies of human adults by determining (a) whether infants show the same pattern of learning biases (primacy effects) and context-sensitivity (to talker voice), (b) whether tamarin monkeys show these same biases and context effects, and (c) what the limits of context-specific statistical learning are in human adults and infants in both word segmentation and referential tasks.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the infants and adults learn the patterns of words in streams of speech and contrast this with performance in nonhuman primates. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal infants and adults can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",8094445,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2011,176482,0.03900184245272346
"Measurement of the time course of statistical learning in word segmentation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical learning refers to a wide variety of phenomena, many of which have been argued to be related to language acquisition. However, there is little agreement on the process that underlies statistical learning. Several different accounts have been proposed, but it has been difficult to differentiate between these accounts as many converge on the same end result of learning. To identify the process responsible for statistical learning, it is necessary to more closely examine behavioral data that can characterize the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure. The objective of the current project is to develop and apply a novel method for examining statistical learning of linguistic materials. This method will provide more comprehensive and sensitive results than prior methods, which will enable these experiments to distinguish between theories of statistical learning in a way that has not been previously possible. In these experiments, participants will be exposed to a stream of syllables made up for nonsense words. Within this stream, words consistently co-occur, while syllable conjunctions formed across word boundaries are less predictable. Participants will be asked to listen for a particular syllable within the speech stream, and respond with a button press when they hear it. For some of these participants, the syllable will occur in an unpredictable location (for example, go in golabu is relatively unpredictable, because it can occur after the end of any word in the speech stream). For other participants, the syllable will occur in a predictable location (for example, bu in golabu is consistently signaled by the presence of both go and la). The experiments outlined in this proposal are a first step towards a process-based, mechanistic account of statistical learning. The first experiment demonstrates that this novel methodology is feasible, and will assess the extent to which the serial reaction time measure correlates with more standard post-test measures. The second and third experiments seek to test process-level predictions of a theory of statistical learning. Experiment 2 assesses the extent to which working memory is related to performance in the task, especially on different word lengths. Experiment 3 assesses a proposal about how chunking might be supplemented by processes of comparison to make learning of non-adjacent regularities possible. Finally, Experiment 4 asks how multiple cues to segmentation are integrated while learning is occurring in real time. By identifying the dynamic characteristics of learning over the course of exposure to the input, this research will test and refine theories of statistical learning in ways that have not previously been possible.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:This research proposal will provide insight into the mechanisms underlying language learning.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"Neural predictors of language acquisition after intensive behavioral intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a phenotypically heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disorders being diagnosed at growing rates in toddlers and young children, with prevalence estimates of 1%. Many children have limited expressive language at the time of diagnosis, and only 50% make significant gains in communication, even with intensive interventions. Unfortunately, intervention studies in ASD have struggled to reliably predict language gain, and, importantly, to differentiate pre-verbal from non-verbal children. One major limitation is the reliance on standardized behavioral assessments, which only capture overt behaviors. Innovative methodology is needed to better characterize the neural correlates of cognitive and perceptual domains important for language acquisition and to apply these methods to inform intervention studies. Such knowledge will allow us to design and apply more effective, targeted interventions for children with ASD based on baseline phenotypes. This study proposes to apply electrophysiological measures to better characterize the neural correlates of two cognitive domains essential for language acquisition: joint attention and statistical learning, along with resting state EEG power, in young children with ASD prior to entry into an intensive behavioral intervention and then after completion of the intervention, in order to determine if specific electrophysiological profiles can predict language acquisition and gain. Combined with the activities outlined in the training plan, this research proposal represents a timely effort to apply translational methods to behavioral intervention studies in order to enrich the conventional predictors of outcome in ASD. The principle unifying this study is that a better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the behavioral and cognitive deficits in ASD will inform predictors of treatment response, which, in turn, will facilitate the development of more targeted interventions for these children. This study is in line with objective 1 (strategy 1.3) and objective 3 (strategy 3.1) of the NIMH strategic plan. Specifically, to (1) ""identify and integrate biological markers (biomarkers) and behavioral indicators associated with mental disorders,"" and to (2) ""further develop innovative interventions and designs for intervention studies."" !      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language impairment is very common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), with 50% remaining non-verbal even with intensive treatments. Clinicians struggle to predict which children will actually make gains in language at the time of a child's diagnosis, largely because of the limitations of standardized testing to characterize these children.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Linking Statistical Learning to Vocabulary Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The research proposed in this application will investigate the connection between statistical learning and vocabulary development. Statistical learning refers to the process of detecting structure in the environment by tracking patterns present in the input. Recent experiments have revealed that infants possess remarkable statistical learning capabilities. Statistical learning may play a significant role in the precocious development of native language sound structure that occurs during the first year of life. During the second year, vocabulary development accelerates. The proposed experiments are motivated by the hypothesis that statistical learning about sounds lays a foundation for word learning. Thus, infants' ability to track statistical regularities may affect the ability to build a vocabulary. This research will examine the relation between individual differences in infants' vocabulary development and individual differences in statistical learning. The experiments will use measures of listening time and looking time to test infants' detection of novel statistical regularities, and to test their knowledge of native-language statistical regularities. Infants will participate speech, non-speech auditory, and visual statistical learning tasks in order to evaluate the coherence of statistical learning across domains. A label-learning task will also tap infants' ability to use native language statistical regularities to acquire new lexical items. In each experiment, infants' performance on experimental tasks will be integrated with measures of their real-world vocabulary development. This findings of this research promise to inform understanding of the underlying mechanism that contribute to individual differences in language acquisition.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism. The findings from this project will influence understanding of typical language development and have potential to affect understanding of language delays and disorders. By focusing research on a mechanism that is thought to play a significant role in language acquisition, we may help to reveal potential deficits and means to identify infants who are at risk of developing lasting language problems.           Relevance The proposed research investigates the relation between individual differences in vocabulary development and how they relate to individual differences in statistical learning, a fundamental language acquisition mechanism.

"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7908812,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,29034,0.06658580926832647
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7758297,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2010,304201,0.054272973042554074
"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax. Benchmarks will be established to emphasize the direct competitive teasting of competing hypotheses from alternative theoretical and methodological positions. n/a",A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development,7813998,R01HD051698,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Child', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Java', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Production', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Stuttering', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'digital', 'disability', 'lexical', 'member', 'phonology', 'programs', 'sound', 'syntax', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,223419,0.044894031737047195
"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7870420,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2010,184005,0.03900184245272346
"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth. Eventually, this research could be used to design preventive programs for infants with a higher risk of language delay (e.g., children with Down Syndrome or SLI).           Project Relevance By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development.

"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials. Taken together, the results of these studies of infants, children, and adults will document the key structural variables in language learning that enable a distributional mechanism of category formation to operate and will highlight the ways these mechanisms may differ over age and domain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input. The use of artificial languages that are acquired in the lab over a few hours provides a window on the mechanisms of language development. We will study language learning in the lab to gain a unique perspective on how the categories (noun, verb, etc) are formed from listening to the patterns of words in a small set of sentences. These studies will not only reveal a basic mechanism of language learning, but also establish benchmarks against which language delay can be compared. Moreover, understanding the mechanisms that lead to successful acquisition in normal children can help to identify loci of language disorders and design methods for remediating disorders.           Public Health Relevance Statement  Language development is one of the hallmarks of the human species, yet it is difficult to study because of the huge variation in early exposure to different amounts of linguistic input.

"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): First language acquisition is a hallmark of normative human development. A substantial body of research suggests that language learning is facilitated by the ability to track statistical regularities in linguistic input. Research during the current project period clearly demonstrates that infants are powerful statistical learners. However, the relevance of these abilities to the learning problems presented in infants' linguistic environments remains poorly understood. The research proposed in this application will test specific hypotheses concerning infant statistical language learning, focusing on how infants make use of statistical information. Specific Aim One is to determine which surface statistics infants can use given natural language input. Specific Aim Two is to determine how the statistics of sound sequences in real speech influence word learning. Specific Aim Three is to determine whether infants' on-line language processing is affected by statistical information. The results of the research proposed in this competing continuation application will promote positive developmental outcomes by expanding our understanding of the learning mechanisms underlying normative development. Individuals who are less facile at statistical learning may be at risk for developmental language disorders. Subsequent research will use the outcome of these studies to motivate investigations including populations of young children at risk for atypical language development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies, which are focused on typical language development, provide an opportunity to test targeted hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying positive language acquisition outcomes.

"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          n/a",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7583888,F32HD057698,"['Address', 'Age', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'phonology', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,50054,0.07654159228699141
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition?

"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be  conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the  input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our  understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and  ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition. n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7560411,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'information processing', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2009,177315,0.050075489273767065
"Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will examine the ability of infants, children, and adults to learn non-adjacent regularities in langauge. Almost all aspects of language (phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics) contain structural relations between elements that are reliable and predictable and yet obstructed by other elements. Common examples include the relationship between ""is"" and ""-ing"" from morphology, or the relationship between noun phrases and verb phases in syntax. To date, theories of language learning have not adequately addressed how learners acquire structural knowledge of this type. The difficulty of learning these types of relationsips is one of the biggest criticisms of statistical learning theories of language acquisition, which largely involve learning language by tracking transitional probabilities between adjacent elements in language. The work is also especially important because failure to learn these types of non-adjacent regularities is a hallmark of many language disorders like Specific Language Impariment (SLI). The first aim of this research is to show how language learners might acquire knowledge about non- adjacent dependancies using knowledge of the language's hiearchical structure, and to see if this structure is learnable by an enriched form of statistical learning. We hypothesize that learners will be able to discover probability-dependant ""chunks"" in language, and use these chunks to transform non-adjacent relationships into adjacent relationships. This aim will be addressed by behavioral experiments with infants and adults. The second aim is to see if people find it easier to learn non-adjacent dependancies in language when those dependancies can be tied to language-external semantic cues. For example, a verb (or a verb phrase) and a direct object (or its noun phrase) might be tightly coupled linguisticly, even if they are separated by embedded clauses in particular sentences. It may be that the way learners acquire this linguistic regularity is by keeping track of the semantic or conceptual association between the verb's and direct object's real world referents. We hypothesize that in conditions where there is semantic relatedness between nonadacent elements in language, this will faciliate learning of the linguistic non-adjacent regularity. This aim will be addressed by a behavioral experiment with children and by a computational model designed to explore how the interaciton of semantic and linguistic knowledge facilliates learning. In summary, proposed research will address a critical question about how people learn the structure of language, address a key shortcoming of one current theory of language acquistion, and have important implications for language disorders like SLI.             n/a",Structural and Semantic Cues for the Acquisition of Linguistic Regularties,7678067,F31DC009936,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Information Distribution', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Morphology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'instrument', 'lexical', 'model design', 'phonology', 'phrases', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'theories']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2009,28830,0.06658580926832647
"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           n/a",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7600444,F32HD055703,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Critiques', 'Cues', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human Characteristics', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'age effect', 'experience', 'natural language', 'phonology', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2009,22393,0.0073057077802270946
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7561736,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2009,235962,0.054272973042554074
"Tools for Automated Assessment of Language    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders including Developmental Language Disorders (DLD) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It is increasingly recognized that assessment should include spontaneous natural language samples. There are measures, such as the Index of Productive Syntax (IPSyn), which are laborious to apply, since they require manual analysis of a corpus of sentences collected from the child. There is therefore a strong need for automated tools to aid clinicians in this task, and to provide more robust analyses for assessment. Many widely-used commercial software packages, such as the Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT) do little more than count linguistic features, and still require someone to code those features. Fully automated systems, such as Computerized Profiling (CP) do exist, but reports vary on how well they work. However, recent advances in natural language processing, in particular in the realm of grammar adaptation, mean that we are now able to produce high-quality commercial software that can be used by clinical practitioners in their assessment of child language. This project will build a commercially viable suite of fully automated, software-based tools, requiring no special equipment beyond a standard personal computer, targeted at clinicians who work with children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The system will have been evaluated not only with children with Typical Development (TD), but with data from children with ASD and DLD. The system will include the following components: (1) text normalization tools to help with the clean up and normalization of transcriptions; (2) a state -of-the-art part-of-speech tagger; (3) a state-of-the-art morphological analyzer; (4) a state-of-the-art syntactic parser; (5) a dependency analyzer and semantic-role labeler, (6) a scoring module to take the output of the language analysis, and map this to the IPSyn or other scales. The software will be written in C++ and Java, and will adopt a rigorous industrial coding style, namely the Google style guide, which is in the public domain. As part of an NIH-funded project on Autism, the Center for Spoken Language Understanding, in collaboration with colleagues at Yale University, has collected a corpus of video and audio recorded interactions of children with ASD and DLD, as well as TD children ages 4-8. In this STTR-funded project, we will perform a manual IPSyn assessment on these data and provide the results as a benchmark on how well the system will perform in the field. While the target language for the initial development will be English, the software will be written in a fully language-independent fashion, in that no properties of English will be hard-coded into the system. All that would be required to 'port' the system to a new language would be appropriate training material for the language.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Language and communication problems critically characterize a number of neurodevelopmental disorders, and it is increasingly recognized that assessment should involve the analysis of spontaneous language samples.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports. Phon will be configured to run either locally or over the web as a Java WebStart application. The construction of the new database will be supported by a group of 26 researchers who have agreed to contribute already collected and transcribed corpora from children learning 17 different languages. Subjects include bilingual children, normally-developing monolinguals, and children with language disorders. The data will be structured to facilitate testing of models regarding babbling universals, variant paths in segmental and prosodic development, markedness effects, prosodic context effects, segmentation patterns, statistical learning, frequency effects, interlanguage transfer, diagnosis of disability, stuttering patterns, disfluency patterns, and the effects of morphology and syntax.

"Social and Statistical Mechanisms of Prelinguistic Vocal Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): How do infants learn to produce the sounds of their language? The vocal abilities of infants change dramatically over the first year of life. Beginning with the earliest, immature vocalizations, infants make rapid progress, typically producing their first words by 12 months of age. Along the way, they begin to produce speech-like syllables and to structure sequences of syllables in accordance with the phonological rules of their language environment. While the vocal achievements of the first year are well-described, not nearly as much is known about the mechanisms of change that drive vocal development. Most work focuses on the maturation of the vocal tract, but studies of vocal development in songbirds found that there are also social sources of developmental change. For example, young male cowbirds (Molothrus ater) rely on the reactions of females to shape their immature sounds into functional song. Based on the avian work, the investigators' preliminary studies have shown that infants can learn new patterns of vocalizing from caregivers' reactions to their babbling. How do infants use social feedback to create new, more developmentally advanced, vocalizations? The goal of the proposed research is to understand the mechanisms by which infants incorporate the phonological patterns of their language into their vocal repertoires. Based on preliminary studies, the investigators hypothesize that the contingent responses of caregivers to babbling facilitate infants' statistical learning of the phonological patterns of their language. To investigate this hypothesis, the variability and temporal contingency of speech to 9-month-old infants will be manipulated to assess their effects on vocal learning. The proposed research has important implications for educating parents in providing optimal learning environments for their infants. An understanding of the role of socially guided learning in speech and language could be used to help parents to be more sensitive to their infants' behavior in ways that would facilitate development. Investigating social influences on phonological development can also contribute to the study of speech-language pathology and of processes underlying both successful and disordered communicative development.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: By illuminating mechanisms by which infants learn to produce the sounds of their language from caregivers' contingent speech, the findings could inform interventions for disordered language development. The results could also be used to help parents and child care providers create social environments that foster and support language growth.

"Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There are an infinite number of possible word-to-world pairings in naturalistic learning environments. Previous studies to solve this mapping problem focus on linguistic, social, and representational constraints at a single moment. The proposed research asks if the indeterminacy problem may also be solved in another way, not in a single trial, but across trials, not in a single encounter with a word and potential referent but cross-situationally. We argue that a cross-situational learning strategy based on computing distributional statistics across words, across referents, and most importantly across the co-occurrences of these two can ultimately map individual words to the right referents despite the logical ambiguity in individual learning moments. Thus, the proposed research focuses on: (1) documenting cross-situational learning in infants from 10- to 16-months of age, (2) investigating the kinds of mechanisms that underlie this learning through both theoretical simulations and experimental studies, and (3) studying how statistical learning builds on itself accumulatively. Understanding those mechanisms and how they might go wrong or be bolstered are surely fundamental to understanding the origins of developmental language disorders that delay or alter early lexical learning. Implementing procedures to benefit children with developmental disorders typically involves altering or highlighting aspects of the learning environment. This requires a principled understanding of the structure and regularities of that environment and processes of statistical learning.           n/a","Cross-Situational statistical word learning:behaviors, mechanisms and constraints",7635904,R01HD056029,"['Achievement', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Age-Years', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ear', 'Empirical Research', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Play', 'Poaceae', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'data mining', 'developmental disease', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'fenson', 'haptics', 'insight', 'interest', 'lexical', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'research study', 'simulation', 'social', 'statistics']",NICHD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2009,186028,0.03900184245272346
"Statistical approaches to linguistic pattern learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed research is to provide a comprehensive account of the factors that affect how infants, children, and adults learn the categories of their native language from distributional information in linguistic input. The categories of a language consist of sets of words (e.g., noun, verb) that play a functionally equivalent role in grammatical sentences. Distributional information refers to the patterning of elements in a large corpus of sentences and includes how frequently those elements occur, what position they occupy in a sentence, and the context provided by neighboring elements. Our longstanding program of research on statistical learning in word segmentation (how learners determine which sound sequences form words) has documented the power, rapidity, and robustness of infants, children, and adults sensitivity to complex distributional information. Here we extend that program of research to a crucial aspect of learning higher-level structures of language. In our proposed studies, we use a miniature artificial language paradigm that affords us complete control over all the distributional cues in the input, something that is virtually impossible using real languages. Participants listen to a sample of utterances and make judgments about their acceptability. Crucially, during a learning phase, they do not hear all possible utterances that are ""legal"" in the artificial language; some are withheld for use in a later post-test. The post-test utterances either conform to the distributional patterns present in the learning phase, or they violate those patterns. The key test is whether participants judge novel-but-legal utterances to be acceptable, thereby showing the ability to generalize correctly beyond the input to which they were exposed. Studies of children provide additional support for learning the distributional cues by pairing utterances with videos of simple events. Studies of adults will be used for comparison, and will also present them with learning materials in the visual-motor domain to assess the detailed time-course of learning and the specificity of the results to auditory linguistic materials.

"When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research project is to employ behavioral and computational methods to better understand how infants use multiple regularities when learning language. Many researchers have posited that infants use statistical learning mechanisms to extract these regularities. However, the majority of this work focuses on infants' abilities to exploit a single regularity. In their natural environment, infants receive input that contains many overlapping regularities of varying consistency. Little research has focused on how infants process this type of input. In order to make use of the cues available in natural input, infants must be able to exploit these overlapping probabilistic regularities. The first aim of this grant is to explore how infants use multiple regularities to find words in fluent speech. By 9 months, infants are able to robustly use both lexical stress and sequential statistics to segment words. However, prior research has focused on how infants use these regularities in isolation, or how weighting of the cues changes developmentally. We hypothesize that infants can use these cues for word segmentation when they are probabilistic and overlapping, as they are in natural languages such as English. The second aim is to investigate the effect of multiple regularities on word learning. As a child's vocabulary grows, regularities arise among the labels and referents they know, as well as within the mappings between labels and referents. These regularities may affect the acquisition of new words. However, their potential role in subsequent word learning has not been carefully explored. Using computational models, we can examine these issues by carefully controlling regularities that exist within a vocabulary and by exploring how different types of regularities may affect word learning. These models can lead to a deeper understanding of these processing mechanisms and to novel predictions, which can then be tested in behavioral experiments.    Public Health Interests:  The goal of this research is to better understand how typically developing infants learn language - in particular, how they use the many patterns that exist in natural languages to do so. The ability to make use of multiple regularities likely affects infants' skills at language learning. By better understanding how this process unfolds in typically developing infants, researchers will be able to investigate how children with language delays and disabilities may differ in their ability to integrate multiple cues. In the future, this information will be useful for developing treatment plans.           n/a",When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition,7488931,F31DC008737,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Behavioral', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Depth', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Infant', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2008,31498,0.050805535093986706
"The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed experiments will investigate the role of statistical learning in the acquisition of syntactic categories such as ""noun"" and ""verb"". The role of syntactic category knowledge in language acquisition is pervasive; for example, category knowledge both facilitates learning grammatical patterns and facilitates early word learning. While many aspects of language acquisition rely on syntactic category knowledge, the process by which these categories are learned is unclear. The goal of the proposed research is to test the hypothesis that statistical learning plays a role in acquiring syntactic categories. Words from different syntactic categories are distinguishable by statistical cues, such as their distributional properties (i.e., cooccurrence with other words), and their phonological properties (i.e., their sound structure), the first specific aim is to assess infants' sensitivity to these cues in the acquisition of noun and verb categories. If words' statistical properties are used in category learning, infants should be able to use these properties to identify novel category members in the early stages of category acquisition. Moreover, infants' ability to determine the category of novel words should reflect the degree to which they conform to the predominant statistical characteristics of the category, and training on these statistical properties should facilitate their use at younger ages. Infants' ability to categorize novel words will be assessed by testing whether they are mapped to object or action referents. The second specific aim is to test infants' ability to integrate statistical and semantic information in category learning. Acquisition of syntactic categories encompasses learning about both statistical properties and semantic properties, and these cues are correlated in natural language. If infants can integrate these cues, correlations between them should facilitate learning. Infants will be familiarized with an artificial language containing novel categories, and the correlations between statistical and semantic cues will be manipulated. If infants can integrate these cues, they should be better able to detect commonalities in the meanings of words within a category, and to learn the grammatical structures in which these words can occur, when cues are correlated than when they are not. Future studies will test children with Specific Language Impairment and other developmental language disorders (e.g., late talkers), who exhibit impaired word learning abilities and reduced sensitivity to distributional cues identifying syntactic categories. Testing children on these tasks will address the extent to which impaired statistical learning is a contributing factor in these disorders.          n/a",The Role of Statistical Learning in Acquiring Syntactic Categories,7408311,F32HD057698,"['Address', 'Age', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'member', 'novel', 'phonology', 'research study', 'sound', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,46826,0.07654159228699141
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development. n/a",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,7336359,R01HD037466,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,270051,0.052788898498516625
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood  manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little  idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning  mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this  proposal. Three general questions guide the research.(1) What are the constraints on language learning  mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or  are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if  'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic  and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique  view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned.  Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes  impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are  adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction  between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy  learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in  languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the  representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific  knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over  inconsistency at all.In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than  constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor  influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be  conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the  input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our  understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and  ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition. n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7390362,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2008,180295,0.050075489273767065
"Auditory constraints on infant language learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the current research is to investigate auditory constraints on general learning mechanisms (GLMs) underlying infant language acquisition. There have been numerous demonstrations of the importance of GLMs in word segmentation, and more recently this approach has been extended to phoneme acquisition. The primary critique of GLMs is that they are too computationally powerful. Without constraints, it would be difficult to extract only meaningful regularities, making the task of language acquisition a potentially intractable problem. Auditory constraints may provide a good framework on which GLMs can operate, facilitating the task of language acquisition. The first Specific Aim of the research proposed in this application is to examine the relationships between auditory sensitivities and distributional learning during phoneme acquisition. 7.5-month-old infants will be exposed to either a unimodal or a bimodal distribution of speech sounds. A habituation procedure will be used to test the hypothesis that the presence of a region of increased auditory sensitivity at a category boundary will facilitate phoneme acquisition. The second Specific Aim is to investigate the relationship between rhythmic grouping biases and statistical learning during word segmentation from fluent speech. Following familiarization to an artificial language that contains both statistical and rhythmic cues to words boundaries, 6.5- and 8.5-month-old infants are expected to mis-segment the statistical words in the language if the statistics and the perceived rhythmic grouping are inconsistent. Age effects are expected only if linguistic experience is necessary for auditory rhythmic grouping biases to emerge. The third Specific Aim is to assess the domain generality of the mechanisms described in the first and second aims. Non-speech stimuli will be used to assess the generality of distributional and statistical learning in the same types of category learning and segmentation tasks. The goal of this research is to understand how the auditory system of a typically developing infant structures language learning. In some atypical populations, it is unclear whether language acquisition is delayed because the auditory system is compromised or because the mechanisms responsible for learning are compromised. Future studies will use these tasks to assess learning in atypical language learners (e.g., young children with phonological disorders, toddlers with cochlear implants, infants at risk for language impairments), with the eventual goal of developing new interventions for use in clinical populations.           n/a",Auditory constraints on infant language learning,7486009,F32HD055703,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Critiques', 'Cues', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human Characteristics', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Phonetics', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Speech Sound', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'age effect', 'experience', 'phonology', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'statistics', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F32,2008,49646,0.0073057077802270946
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7386787,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2008,239691,0.054272973042554074
"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning.

"A Shared Database for the Study of Phonological Development DESCRIPTION:  The study of phonological development has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, models of the biological bases of language production, the teaching of second languages, and the general advancement of linguistic theory. Recents advances in computational power make it possible for researchers to link high quality digital recordings to phonological and phonetic transcriptions. Using standards such as Unicode, IPA, and XML, the CHILDES database project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu) now provides universal access to large corpora of transcripts linked to audio for students of both first and second language acquisition, along with a wide array of tools for lexical, syntactic, and discourse analysis. However, the CHILDES Project has not yet built effective tools for phonological and phonetic analysis.  We will close this gap by developing a new Java-based program called Phon that interfaces with the CHILDES transcription format. Phon provides: (1) easy user-controlled utterance boundary marking, (2) an input method for Unicode IPA transcription of child forms, (3) automatic alignment of segments in child forms to waveform regions, (4) automatic insertion of the IPA form for adult target words, (5) automatic alignment of child forms to the adult targets for both segmental and prosodic levels, (6) tools for querying the database, and (7) tools for composing output reports.

"When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research project is to employ behavioral and computational methods to better understand how infants use multiple regularities when learning language. Many researchers have posited that infants use statistical learning mechanisms to extract these regularities. However, the majority of this work focuses on infants' abilities to exploit a single regularity. In their natural environment, infants receive input that contains many overlapping regularities of varying consistency. Little research has focused on how infants process this type of input. In order to make use of the cues available in natural input, infants must be able to exploit these overlapping probabilistic regularities. The first aim of this grant is to explore how infants use multiple regularities to find words in fluent speech. By 9 months, infants are able to robustly use both lexical stress and sequential statistics to segment words. However, prior research has focused on how infants use these regularities in isolation, or how weighting of the cues changes developmentally. We hypothesize that infants can use these cues for word segmentation when they are probabilistic and overlapping, as they are in natural languages such as English. The second aim is to investigate the effect of multiple regularities on word learning. As a child's vocabulary grows, regularities arise among the labels and referents they know, as well as within the mappings between labels and referents. These regularities may affect the acquisition of new words. However, their potential role in subsequent word learning has not been carefully explored. Using computational models, we can examine these issues by carefully controlling regularities that exist within a vocabulary and by exploring how different types of regularities may affect word learning. These models can lead to a deeper understanding of these processing mechanisms and to novel predictions, which can then be tested in behavioral experiments.    Public Health Interests:  The goal of this research is to better understand how typically developing infants learn language - in particular, how they use the many patterns that exist in natural languages to do so. The ability to make use of multiple regularities likely affects infants' skills at language learning. By better understanding how this process unfolds in typically developing infants, researchers will be able to investigate how children with language delays and disabilities may differ in their ability to integrate multiple cues. In the future, this information will be useful for developing treatment plans.           n/a",When cues converge: multiple regularities in language acquisition,7286034,F31DC008737,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Behavioral', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Depth', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Infant', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'interest', 'lexical', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2007,31498,0.050805535093986706
"Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acquiring a language is among the most daunting feats uniformly accomplished by our species. Explorations of the language learning process present the opportunity to address central issues pertaining to human cognition and its development. The proposed research represents one approach to this topic: the study of the architecture of the learning processes underlying language acquisition, using laboratory learning experiments performed with adult, child, and infant participants. The goal of this research program is to substantially increase our knowledge of the statistical learning mechanisms that detect linguistic units by tracking the patterns of sounds, words, and other units in the input. Recent results suggest that statistical learning processes play an important role in the acquisition of language. However, little is currently known about the types of statistical regularities computed by learners and the constraints on learning that support successful knowledge acquisition. The proposed experiments will ask: (1) How does the structure of the input constrain statistical learning? Studies will consider perceptual, linguistic, and informational constraints on the choice of cues as input to learning. (2) How does prior experience influence statistical learning? Manipulations of prior experience, inside and outside the lab, will be used to assess effects on subsequent learning. (3) Can statistical learning account for basic phenomena in language acquisition? Interactions between statistical learning and other types of processes, such as rule learning and the presence of other cues in the input, will be investigated. All of these issues will be addressed using previously developed laboratory learning paradigms that permit careful manipulation of input and detailed assessment of what participants are able to learn. Studies using linguistic materials will be contrasted with studies using nonlinguistic materials to further explore the locus and domain-specificity of the learning mechanisms under consideration. The answers to these questions will inform an emerging theoretical framework, constrained statistical learning, intended to elucidate the study of language acquisition and other pressing issues in human learning and development. n/a",Statistical Learning in Language Acquisition,7144995,R01HD037466,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'experience', 'programs', 'research study', 'sound', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2007,275672,0.052788898498516625
"Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All human learners with normal cognitive capacities who are exposed to language input in childhood manage to acquire a language that looks very much like their input. However, at present we have little idea how, exactly, learners accomplish this feat. We have little understanding of the nature of the learning mechanisms that underlie and support language learning. This is the focus of the research in this proposal. Three general questions guide the research. (1) What are the constraints on language learning mechanisms? (2) Are the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition specific to language or are they of a more general nature? (3) Do these mechanisms change over time as learners age, and if 'so, how? The proposed research examines these questions by investigating the learning of probabilistic and inconsistent patterns in the input using miniature artificial languages. This provides a rather unique view of the constraints on learning mechanisms, examining the limits of what can and cannot be learned. Previous work has shown that learners can acquire probabilistic patterns, however they sometimes impose consistency on variation. Moreover, children are more likely to change such patterns than are adults. The present research expands on the earlier results, asking about the nature of the interaction between learners and input. Series 1 asks about the nature of the input that makes some inconstancy learnable and some not. The studies examine the limits of veridical learning of inconsistent patterns in languages, asking questions about the specificity of computations learners can perform, the representations over which such computations can be performed, and the effect of prior domain-specific knowledge. Series 2 asks about the nature of the learner, asking why learners regularize over inconsistency at all. In particular, the studies examine whether working memory constraints, rather than constraints stemming directly from the learning mechanisms themselves, are an important factor influencing whether learners acquire the variation or instead impose regularity. Both series will be conducted with adults and children to examine how learning changes over development. Although the input in the proposed studies is somewhat atypical, the results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of the learning mechanisms involved in language acquisition more generally, and ultimately, this increases our understanding of both normal and disordered acquisition.         n/a",Constraints on Learning from Inconsistent Input,7212176,R01HD048572,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Modality', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'age related', 'design', 'programs', 'research study', 'stem']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,186741,0.04962207314876681
"Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A fundamental task in sentence comprehension involves assigning semantic roles to sentence constituents, determining who does what to whom. Verb knowledge plays a central role in this task. The verb determines what constituents can appear in the sentence, and what participant roles they will convey. In learning a new verb, a child must determine what relationship among participants the verb refers to, without the set of semantic instructions provided by the verb. The syntactic bootstrapping theory proposes that children use precursors of the adult's knowledge of syntax to understand sentences and therefore to learn verbs. This view is supported by evidence that children as young as 2 assign different meanings to verbs presented in different sentence structures. The proposed research asks what syntactic cues are helpful early in acquisition, before many of the complexities of syntax acquisition have been conquered. First, we argue that children treat the number of nouns in the sentence as a cue to its semantic predicate- argument structure. The number of nouns in the sentence is useful because it provides a probabilistic indicator of the verb's number of arguments. Second, early syntactic bootstrapping requires that children represent language experience in an abstract mental vocabulary that permits rapid generalization of syntactic learning to new verbs. Thus, we argue that language-specific grammatical learning, such as detecting the significance of word order in English, should transfer quickly to sentences containing new verbs, permitting progressively finer constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning. This project explores how syntactic bootstrapping begins, and how it interacts with early progress in syntax acquisition. We take two complementary approaches: (1) Experiments with infants and toddlers will investigate the detection and use of the proposed simple structural cues to sentence interpretation and verb learning. (2) Computational experiments using a system for automatic semantic role labeling will test the main claims of our account using a substantial sample of natural child-directed speech. This combination of experimental and computational studies is intended to advance scientific knowledge about how children learn their native languages, and to guide the development of new, robust learning protocols that will be of use in automatic natural language processing. The proposed research will help us to understand how infants and toddlers learn the words and syntax of their native languages; such research will contribute to the detection and remediation of language delays, and to language pedagogy.           n/a",Verb learning and the early development of sentence comprehension,7176737,R01HD054448,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Eating', 'Event', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Infant', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Linguistics', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patient Agents', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychologist', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'computer studies', 'experience', 'feeding', 'lens', 'lexical', 'novel', 'programs', 'remediation', 'research study', 'success', 'syntax', 'theories']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2007,241833,0.054272973042554074
"Linking Language Comprehension to Production Patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project tests specific hypotheses about dependencies between language comprehension and production, which are typically studied independently. The PI's production-distribution-comprehension (PDC) account holds that utterance planning choices during language production yield distributional patterns in the language, in which certain syntactic structures co-vary with particular word choices, messages, and discourse environments. Comprehenders, through statistical learning during prior comprehension experiences, become highly sensitive to these patterns, and this sensitivity guides comprehension processes. Thus, many aspects of comprehension can ultimately be traced to task demands related to language production. Specific aims of the project include: (1) Link syntactic structure choice in production to mechanisms of sentence planning. (2) Compare the PDC account of comprehension to alternative views of relative clause interpretation. (3) Test the causal relations between production constraints, distributional patterns in the language, and comprehension performance. (4) Relate adult sentence comprehension to statistical learning. (5) Test the current limits of constraint-based models of language comprehension. The PDC approach offers a significant alternative to other views and also may inform language acquisition research by illuminating the role of distributional patterns in child language acquisition.

"Therapeutic Robot to Teach Social Skills to Primary School Children with ASD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract: This project is part of a long-term effort to reduce the burdens and disability associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The majority of adults and adolescents who have an ASD diagnosis do not have mental retardation, and are notable for their language abilities, which in many cases appear intact. Nevertheless, these individuals fail to achieve vocational success consonant with their intellectual level, and may be unable to form friendships and relationships outside their family. The specific aim of the project is to develop a training simulation to improve these individuals' ability to participate in social conversation. Equipped with basic conversational skills, individuals with ASD may gain more opportunities to interact and improve the quality of their relationships. The applicant is using technology it originally developed to create training simulations for specialized social interactions (e.g., for an interviewer to detect suicide risk in a soldier). The training simulation is based on a complex model of the simulated character's shifting emotional state in response to the history of the conversation, the user's most recent response, and an element of chance. The simulation includes a database of hundreds of video clips performed by a professional actor, and a large set of responses available for the user to speak or select by mouse click. The system offers help features, with straightforward explanations of the simulated character's reactions, and guidance with response choice; an on-screen coach who provides overt signals in response to the appropriateness of the user's response choice; playback options, so that the user can review parts or all of an interaction; and game features: points for success and cheering for improved scores and ultimately achieving the game's objective, agreement of the simulated character to another meeting with the user. The simulation content will be developed by the applicant's skilled script-writers with input from an autism researcher from Catholic University, then reviewed prior to video by three research and clinical specialists in ASD and a gentleman who himself has ASD, prior to videotaping. Usability field-testing will be conducted with 10 members of the target population. Data representing their use of the simulation and its features will be automatically logged, and they will respond to a debriefing questionnaire. Any modifications indicated will be incorporated into the more extensive simulation to be proposed for Phase II funding. Project Narrative: This project will adapt a therapeutic toy robot, CosmoBot, in order to engage children with severe social delays associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in activities to promote development of social skills. The toy robot will be equipped with sets of game programs from which therapists can choose. Therapists in 2 locations will test the therapeutic toy and its social games with 10 primary-school-aged children who have these impairments, in order to evaluate how easy the system is to use, how much it appeals to the children, and whether it has positive effects on children's social skills.          n/a",Therapeutic Robot to Teach Social Skills to Primary School Children with ASD,7172787,R43HD054407,"['artificial intelligence', 'autism', 'behavior modification', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'child psychology', 'clinical research', 'communication', 'computer simulation', 'educational resource design /development', 'face expression', 'field study', 'human subject', 'human therapy evaluation', 'interactive multimedia', 'interpersonal relations', 'middle childhood (6-11)', 'questionnaires', 'robotics', 'social behavior', 'social integration', 'videotape /videodisc']",NICHD,"ANTHROTRONIX, INC.",R43,2006,122809,0.10909675627163194

"Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism PROJECT SUMMARY This R21 addresses a critical need for accurate and scalable screening tools able to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) within the first year of life. This project will pilot an innovative digital phenotyping screening method, which uses computer vision and machine learning to measure synchrony within simple infant-caregiver interactions. Synchrony refers to the tendency for infants to spontaneously and dynamically coordinate their behaviors with their caregivers in time. This critical and early-emerging developmental process may provide unique and precise information about an infant’s risk for ASD, while also offering a lens for understanding early social interaction differences at the core of ASD. Significance: This project represents a paradigm shift in ASD screening, moving beyond behavior rating scales toward methods that are better suited to capture the subtle early indicators of ASD. Caregiver rating scales lack the granularity and objectivity necessary for detecting signs of ASD that emerge slowly and subtly throughout the first year. Approach: The interdisciplinary study team will leverage cutting-edge technology to objectively and granularly measure synchrony within 5-minute, play-based infant-caregiver interactions. Markerless computer vision will be used to quantify facial movements, captured unobtrusively with small, bidirectional cameras. The dyadic synchrony among infants’ and caregivers’ facial movements will then be calculated throughout the interaction, as part of an automated machine learning pipeline. Preliminary Data: We evaluated this approach in young adults with and without ASD during brief conversational interactions with research staff members. In a machine learning analysis pipeline, synchrony features classified diagnosis with 91% accuracy - significantly better than expert clinicians assessing the same videos. The same set of synchrony features significantly predicted symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that this method is effective for both diagnostic classification and dimensional prediction of individual differences. Importantly, the pipeline also classified diagnosis in children with similarly high accuracy, demonstrating the reproducibility of results across age groups. Aims. This project extends these computer vision-based methods to infants, with the overarching goal of evaluating their utility as a Level II screener for ASD. Aim 1 will evaluate the concurrent validity of our computational measures of interactional synchrony by evaluating their relationships with an established clinician-administered assessment of early ASD markers. Aim 2 will assess the utility of our interactional synchrony measure as a Level II screening tool at 12 months, by testing its ability to predict future ASD diagnosis with high specificity. Impact: This R21 will provide initial validation for a novel, computer vision- based screener for ASD in infancy. By targeting the dynamics of natural infant-caregiver interactions, this method has the potential to identify very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge. Moreover, this quick interaction-based screener would fit easily into the context of routine pediatric care, holding promise as a Level II screener deployable within a universal screening framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new method of screening for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy, leveraging computer vision and machine learning to develop a screening tool that detects alterations in the dynamic social coordination between infants and caregivers during brief, play-based interactions. There are currently no screening tools capable of reliably detecting ASD in the first year of life, and in particular, no tools based on direct measurement of behavior that can be feasibly deployed in primary care. This project addresses this critical public health challenge by examining an objective, granular, and scalable Level II screener, which has potential to lower the average age of diagnosis by identifying very early signs of disrupted social development, even before classic ASD symptoms emerge.",Novel computer vision-based assessment of infant-caregiver synchrony as an early level II screening tool for autism,10023938,R21HD102078,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Life', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Severities', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'age group', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior rating scale', 'computational pipelines', 'digital', 'early screening', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'social', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'young adult']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2020,220000,0.1152109678811462
"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families.

"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,9842013,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,774965,0.06865923205598375
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,9971165,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized diagnostics', 'random forest', 'symptomatology', 'treatment stratification', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,1177059,0.06646099816953178
"Data-driven map of the postsynaptic density to decipher autism pathogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex neurodevelopmental diseases that lead to enormous social, emotional, and economic impact. Decades of research have demonstrated the strong genetic contribution to the disease etiology. Many of the high-confidence autism genes are localized to the postsynaptic density (PSD), which is a complex protein-dense structure typically located in the dendritic spine of excitatory synapses. It is comprised of a diverse panel of proteins including master scaffolds, neurotransmitter receptors, and cytoskeleton regulators. Even though studies have shown that disruption of the PSD is a central mechanism of autism, it remains unclear how these genes aggregate in protein pathways and disrupt synaptic function. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease in the synapse, the proposed study will construct a comprehensive data-driven model of the PSD to decipher critical pathways in autism and prioritize novel disease candidates. In Aim 1, a random forest model will be trained to predict novel PSD genes, which will be validated through in vitro experiments. The machine learning model will integrate a broad spectrum of different data types to identify PSD genes based on their biological properties such as expression profile, protein structure, and others. The predicted PSD genes will be validated through immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)- derived neurons. Aim 2 will organize the identified PSD network into a hierarchical ontology to enable pathway analysis of disease genes. Logistic regression and gene enrichment analysis will be applied to the novel PSD hierarchy to determine key pathways in autism pathogenesis. Aim 3 will leverage the PSD ontology to predict the protein neighbors most likely to be disrupted by ASD genes. To validate the predictions, CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing system will be used to delete high-confidence ASD genes in hiPSC-derived neurons; quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and biochemical analysis will be completed to characterize the predicted protein neighbors. Collectively, these aims will reveal the critical synaptic pathways in ASD pathogenesis and provide an integrative map for how seemingly disparate disease genes can lead to the same disease phenotypes. These multidisciplinary studies will be the first of their kind in the synapse and will enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ASD. The proposed studies will be completed in Dr. Trey Ideker’s lab at UCSD, which is equipped with state-of-the-art instruments to enable the computational and experimental work described. The proposed training plan focuses on gaining expertise in integrative studies, bioinformatics, neuroscience, mentorship, leadership, and communication. Completion of these aims will provide significant experience in all five domains, and facilitate the transition to academic independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even though many genes associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been localized to the postsynaptic density (PSD), the exact molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis remain unclear. To address this, the proposed study will construct a data-driven map of the PSD that hierarchically organizes genes into functional pathways. By applying an integrative approach of machine learning and experimental validation, the study will identify novel disease genes and key synaptic mechanisms in ASD.",Data-driven map of the postsynaptic density to decipher autism pathogenesis,10068068,F32MH124408,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Critical Pathways', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Enzymes', 'Etiology', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitter Receptor', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cost', 'density', 'disease phenotype', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'immunocytochemistry', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'large scale data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postsynaptic', 'postsynaptic density protein', 'presynaptic density protein 95', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'random forest', 'scaffold', 'social', 'supervised learning', 'synaptic function', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'validation studies']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2020,69306,0.03185404294305597
"Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism Abstract This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics (e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill, and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together, these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy. These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc- cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD. Project Narrative At the most basic level, social communication boils down to what you say and what you do while interacting with other people. Problems with social communication affect individuals with ASD throughout their lives, but expensive and time-consuming measurement tools have hindered the development of effective treatments for this core challenge. In this proposal, we aim to improve clinical characterization and diagnostic decision- making in ASD and other psychiatric conditions by digitizing human vocal interaction and using advanced machine learning techniques to fuse audio-video signals into an autism-specific algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for future precision medicine efforts and advancing the state of public health.",Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism,9866358,R01DC018289,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'clinical care', 'cognitive process', 'data fusion', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'sound', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2020,589454,0.08658521326665511
"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,9984541,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387808,0.08022011725093244
"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,9927671,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,760273,0.12776941002196157
"Protecting the privacy of the child through facial identity removal in recorded behavioral observation sessions PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) benefit from specialized services throughout their lifespan. Eligibility for these services is determined by behavioral assessments and clinical observation. In an effort to make the assessment process faster, more reliable, and more accessible, there have been decades of research on the identification of markers that provide insight into ASD. For example, gaze following, eye contact, and gaze aversion are all cues relevant to the assessment of autism. Observations through behavioral assessments, especially in clinical research settings, are often videotaped for purposes such as repeat viewing, record keeping, training, and assessing the longitudinal impact of intervention. However, these videos are often also the basis for explorations of nuances and behavioral signals that may lead to researchers to even stronger and more reliable marker signals to the benefit of the clinical decision-making process. More recently, advances in computational methods such as computer vision techniques have begun to provide new avenues into the discovery and identification of novel behavioral markers associated with ASD. The tuning and training of these techniques relies on the availability of annotated video data for discovery. However, though assessment video datasets are uniquely valuable for these research purposes, it is difficult to share them because of privacy considerations. As a result, the current practice is to tightly control access to video sessions. This study proposes the development of privacy mechanisms for video observation sessions, specifically focusing on mechanisms that protect the facial identity of the child under observation while retaining gaze-based information critical for diagnostic assessments. Our approach is to implement known privacy mechanisms from the third-person video surveillance literature as well as novel mechanisms based on algorithms developed for non-photorealistic rendering and deep neural network based facial transfer that are applicable to this domain. We will evaluate these mechanisms on the extent of anonymization provided and the impact they have on behavioral assessment. The output of this research will be a characterization of known and novel privacy mechanisms with respect to utility for anonymization and behavioral observation. It is our goal that this study create technology to facilitate privacy enabled video data sharing, thus accelerating computational and behavioral research for ASD. Private videos can also be used to create training materials for behavioral analysts, thus increasing the breadth of content they can review in their training, allowing for faster training, enabling remote/online training, and creating opportunities for remote consultation in clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study creates methods to protect facial identity of children in videos of recorded behavioral observation sessions. Testing these methods on videos from 50 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we will characterize well-established and novel video privacy mechanisms along two dimensions: (1) the extent to which they protect facial identity; and (2) the extent to which they retain the information needed for behavioral observations in the context of ASD assessment.",Protecting the privacy of the child through facial identity removal in recorded behavioral observation sessions,10042998,R21MH123997,"['Address', 'Administrator', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attitude', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Remote Consultation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Voice', 'Work', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior observation', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'data sharing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'facial recognition algorithm', 'facial recognition software', 'falls', 'gaze', 'health care delivery', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodal data', 'neural network', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'psychologic', 'two-dimensional', 'usability']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,416152,0.025135918028834872
"Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence ABSTRACT  Approximately 15% of toddlers 18-36 months of age experience late language emergence (LLE; Paul, 1992; Singleton, 2018). These late talkers (LTs) have a reduced expressive vocabulary, but average non-linguistic abilities, in the absence of overt sensory or other developmental delays (Collisson, 2016; Paul & Jennings, 1992). Upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for language disorder (Rescorla, 2009), while others retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). LTs are at elevated risk for lifelong language and literacy impairments that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Singleton, 2018; Paul, 1993), and even subclinical outcomes have pervasive negative impacts (Rescorla, 2002). This project addresses questions crucial for the early diagnosis of LTs and prerequisite to the applicant’s long-term goal of establishing an independent research program on LLE, aimed ultimately at identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes to provide a foundation for more targeted interventions for LTs. This project complements prior work on LLE focused on language production by evaluating the time course of word learning and spoken word recognition in LTs and 2 control groups (age- and language-matched typically developing peers), all of whom will complete standardized assessments of cognitive -linguistic abilities. In Expt. 1, participants will train on a simple selection task using 4 novel and 4 familiar words that overlap phonologically (e.g., at onset, BUNNY-BUTTON, or offset, KITTEN-MITTEN). We will use eye tracking to estimate group and individual differences in lexical activation and competition over time. In Expt. 2, we will record EEG (electroencephalography) in a passive listening task. Participants will watch a silent video as newly-learned and familiar words from Expt. 1 are repeated. ERP (event-related potential) analyses will examine individual and group differences in responses to newly-learned vs. familiar words. We will also use machine-learning (support vector machines, SVMs) to decode EEG responses to specific words for each participant, on the logic that fidelity and coherence of responses will determine SVM classification success. Group and individual differences in eye tracking, ERP, and/or EEG-decoding measures will provide new insights into receptive abilities of LTs, and provide a basis for future work aimed at identifying LTs with greatest risk for clinical or subclinical language outcomes. The project will take place at the U. of Connecticut and Haskins Labs. The applicant and sponsors have developed a training plan for the applicant focused on further developing her (1) EEG and statistical skills, (2) knowledge base of the cognitive neuroscience of typical and atypical language development, (3) dissemination skills, and (4) understanding of principles for the responsible conduct of research, with the aim of supporting her goal to be an independent researcher in a Research-1 environment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Approximately 15% of toddlers meet criteria for being a late talker (LT) (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018;) and upwards of 16% of LTs prospectively meet criteria for spoken and/or written language disorder (Rescorla, 2009) while another subset will retain suboptimal language functioning (Rescorla, 2002; Singleton, 2018). Late language emergence (LLE) is associated with lifelong clinical and subclinical weaknesses in language and literacy that negatively impact access to academic and vocational opportunities (Paul, 1993; Singleton, 2018), and even subclinical outcomes have a negative impact on vocational and higher educational choices (Rescorla, 2002). The proposed research will address questions prerequisite to the applicant's long-term goal of establishing an independent research program aimed at (1) identifying early markers of chronic impact in order to optimally allocate scarce early intervention resources and (2) identifying variation and distribution of behavioral phenotypes which will provide the foundation for more focused and targeted forms of interventions for LTs with a range of clinical and subclinical language outcomes.",Behavioral and Neurobiological Underpinnings of Spoken Word Recognition in Late Language Emergence,9975626,F31DC018220,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Connecticut', 'Control Groups', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Endowment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exclusion', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Morphology', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'language impairment', 'language outcome', 'language processing', 'lexical', 'lexical processing', 'literacy', 'multimodality', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'peer', 'phonology', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'skills', 'social', 'sound', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,F31,2020,15602,0.01931154184077789
"Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since untreated language disorder - a disorder with a prevalence of at least 7% - can lead to serious behavioral and educational problems, large-scale early language assessment is urgently needed not only for early identification of language disorder but also for planning interventions and tracking progress. This is all the more so because a recent study found that 71% of children diagnosed with Specific Language Impairment (a type of language disorder) had not been previously identified. However, such large-scale efforts would pose a large burden on professional staff and on other scarce resources. As a result, clinicians, educators, and researchers have argued for the use of computer based assessment. Recently, progress has been made with computer based language assessment, but it has been limited to language comprehension (i.e., receptive vocabulary and grammar). Thus, computer based assessment of language production that is expressive language and particularly discourse skills, is still lacking. One contributing factor is that a key technology needed for this, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), is perceived as inadequate for accurate scoring of language tests since even the best ASR systems have word error rates in excess of 20%. However, this perception is based on a limited perspective of how ASR can be used for assessment, in which a general- purpose ASR system provides an (often inaccurate) transcript of the child's speech, which then would be scored automatically according to conventional rules. We take an alternative perspective, and propose an innovative approach that comprises two core concepts. The first is that of creating special-purpose, test-specific ASR systems whose search space is carefully matched to the space of responses a test may elicit. The second is that of integrating these systems with machine-learning based scoring algorithms whereby the latter operate not on the final, ""best"" transcript generated by the ASR system but on the rich layers of intermediate representations that the ASR system computes in the process of recognizing the input speech (""rich representation""). Earlier experiments in our lab with digit and narrative recall tests have demonstrated the feasibility of this approach. In the proposed project we will create computer-based scoring and test administration systems for tests in the expressive modality as well as in the vocabulary, grammar, and discourse domains; we will also create a system for a non-word repetition test. The systems will be applied to a diverse group of 300 children ages 3-9 with typical development and with neurodevelopmental disorders, and will be validated against conventional language measures. The automated language tests developed in the project cover core diagnostic criteria for language disorders but also create a technological foundation for the computerization of a much broader array of tests for voice based language and cognitive assessment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is a significant need for language assessment for early detection, diagnosis, screening, and progress tracking of language difficulties. However, assessment involves face-to-face sessions with a professional, which may not always be available and affordable. The project goal is to provide a technology solution, by designing, implementing, and evaluating computer-based systems for automated voice-based language assessment (both test administration and test scoring) for narrative recall, picture naming, sentence repetition, sentence completion, and nonword repetition.",Automatic Voice-Based Assessment of Language Abilities,9825536,R01DC013996,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Sign Language', 'Assessment tool', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Systems', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'High Prevalence', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Language Tests', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Names', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scoring Method', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow up assessment', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'language comprehension', 'language disorder diagnosis', 'phonology', 'psychiatric symptom', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'school district', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'social communication', 'specific language impairment', 'syntax', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,574747,0.02203049891123589
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,9936240,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,195916,0.07285509412342994
"Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder characterized by impairment of social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviors, with severity ranging from mild to signiﬁcantly disabling. The prevalence in the United States is rising (currently about 1 in 68 children) and the associated costs are great. In our most recent previous efforts on this project, we have initiated development of a graph-based, Bayesian neuroimage analysis framework and have used it to characterize brain pathology in ASD and identify abnormal functional subnetworks from groupwise data. Key results demonstrated clear differences in task- based functional brain networks between ASD and typically developing control (TDC) groups associated with the perception of biological motion. While our efforts (and those of others) are important for characterizing ASD, advances in the characterization of response to therapy with imaging are crucial for improved understanding, and ultimately personalization, of these therapies. Thus, we propose to put forth a bold new direction: to further develop our analysis methodology and study these task-based subnetworks, now with the goal of characterizing individuals in terms of their predicted response to treatment. We will focus on Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), an intensive behavioral therapy for children with ASD that improves social communication skills. We ﬁrst propose to fully develop our uniﬁed Bayesian framework to detect both hyper- and hypo-synchronous functional subnetworks within whole-brain, groupwise, task-based fMRI data on a large training dataset of ASD and TDC subjects. We will identify dense subgraphs (communities) that exhibit group differences in functional synchrony between ASD and TDC groups. The groupwise subnetworks will then be mapped to single subject, task-based fMRI data acquired from a cohort of ASD subjects treated with PRT. For each subject, imaging biomarkers based on activation signal strength and functional connectivity will be derived for regions within each hyper- and hypo- synchronous subnetwork at both baseline and after 16 weeks of therapy. Using a random forest regression strategy, we will use a combination of biomarkers from the baseline data to predict response to PRT (using change in Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition as the primary clinical outcome measure). In addition, we will use a combination of biomarkers from baseline and 16 weeks to predict treatment persistence at 32 weeks. We will compare the prediction capability of our new approach using task-based fMRI to a set of biomarkers with regions identiﬁed from groupwise analysis of resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) networks found from the same training subjects noted above using an alternative state-of-the-art method. We will also develop methods to examine potential metabolic alterations in networks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA and glutamate (the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters) to explore possible biochemical differences associated with ASD, changes in response to PRT and the use of this information as additional imaging biomarkers. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a difﬁcult and growing problem. The goal of this project is to develop sensi- tive and quantitative imaging and image analysis methodology for the study of ASD aimed at measuring brain pathology and using it to characterize and predict response to therapy. This work will advance our understanding of this disorder and its treatment and ultimately inform and guide personalized therapies.",Subnetwork-based Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Therapy Assessment in Autism,9912861,R01NS035193,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Aminobutyric Acids', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motion', 'Motion Perception', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Prevalence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Series', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visuospatial', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'developmental disease', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'information processing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient biomarkers', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'random forest', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'theories', 'treatment response']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,371982,0.11762495589500369
"Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders Improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, progress in testing these treatments is limited by the lack of informative outcome measures to indicate whether or not an intervention or treatment is having the desired effect on a child's conversational use of language (i.e., discourse skills). The long-term goal of the proposed renewal project is to harness the benefits of NLP to impact functional spoken language outcomes for children with neurodevelopmental disorders. The goal of the parent R01 (R01DC012033) is to develop and validate new Natural Language Processing (NLP) based methods that automatically measure discourse-related skills, including language productivity (talkativeness), grammar and vocabulary, and discourse, based on raw (i.e., not coded or annotated) transcripts of natural language samples. Our objective in this proposal is to take the next step to evaluate the suitability of these NLP-based measures as outcomes for children with a range of intellectual abilities, language levels, and diagnoses. NLP algorithms require choices of pivotal parameter settings, such as word frequency dependent weights. While our previous results, involving between-group contrasts, were insensitive to these settings, our proposed project, involving psychometric quantities such as validity, may be sensitive to them. Building on our progress from the parent R01, we propose to pursue three specific aims: (1) Identify pivotal parameter settings that optimize stability of NLP discourse measures, and examine responsiveness to real change; (2) Evaluate consistency of NLP discourse measures, and identify key measurement factors that impact consistency; and (3) Evaluate validity of NLP discourse measures, and differences in validity as a function of diagnostic group, age, IQ, and language ability. Our approach will focus on optimizing stability of such measures, and assessing responsiveness to change over time, consistency across sampling contexts and different sample lengths, and validity of each measure. The contribution of the proposed project will be to systematically assess the psychometric properties of NLP discourse measures. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a substantial departure from the status quo by taking the crucial next step: the development of scalable, psychometrically sound measures of discourse skills that can be used to assess between-group differences as well as within-individual change over time. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to result in viable spoken language outcome measures for children with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, making it possible to target and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions. Ultimately, the successful completion of this study will provide the immediate ability to scale up treatment evaluations involving measurement of spoken language use, allowing flexible data collection across sites and studies, and in the future provide new targets for to-be-developed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. The proposed research is relevant to public health because improving conversational use of spoken language is an important goal for many new interventions and treatments for children with neurodevelopmental disorders, and outcome measures that are automated, quantitative, scalable, and objective are needed to evaluate these treatments. The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because it contributes to the development of fundamental knowledge about the spoken language use among children with a range of neurodevelopment disorders and conversational language difficulties, and will make it possible to target spoken language and meaningfully measure improvements in clinical trials and behavioral interventions.",Automated measurement of language outcomes for neurodevelopmental disorders,9895715,R01DC012033,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stereotyping', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vocabulary', 'Weight', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'common treatment', 'design', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informant', 'innovation', 'language outcome', 'natural language', 'neurodevelopment', 'parent project', 'scale up', 'skills', 'sound', 'symptomatic improvement', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,583798,0.03823491492679872
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group. This has clear implications for identifying those at risk for autism and for ongoing clinical care.",Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development,9929027,R01MH114999,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Client', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical care', 'common treatment', 'communication behavior', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovative technologies', 'joint attention', 'language outcome', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NIMH,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,341605,0.03435519809039289
"Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD. Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model- based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g. face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant, interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1) hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD- relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular, we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically- driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets. Project Narrative Despite social deficits being core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contributing to relationship difficulties and low employment rates, their neurobiological underpinnings are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about the brain mechanisms underlying social deficits in autism using computational modeling, novel brain imaging tools, and interactive experimental tasks that simulate dynamic social interactions.

"Harnessing Electronic Health Records to Identify Participants and to Study Health Outcomes in Transition-Age Youth and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder The health care needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are complex and multifaceted, with access to quality care a major challenge. Co-occurring physical and mental health conditions are highly prevalent in transition-age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD. Treating these conditions represents an important avenue for improving quality of life in this population. Provider-based training programs, such as Project Extension for Community Health Care Outcomes (Project ECHO), has been shown to increase provider knowledge self-efficacy, although their impact on health care outcomes and health care utilization in TAY/adults with ASD is understudied. The overarching goal of this K18 application is to provide training in health services research related to TAY/adults with ASD, specifically focused on harnessing data from electronic health records (EHR) to study health outcomes in future interventional studies. These skills are preparatory to designing and carrying out a rigorous future trial of Project ECHO is TAY/adults with ASD. In the K18, I will use deidentified datasets at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and Kaiser-Permanente Northern California (KPNC). My research specific aims are (1) Determine the utility of applying novel algorithms for identifying and characterizing cases of TAY/adults with ASD within the VUMC deidentified EHR and (2) Analyze how common physical and mental health conditions and measures of health care utilization change with increasing age in in an existing longitudinal cohort of TAY/adults with ASD within the KPNC EHR. My training goals are (1) Learn how to use pragmatic tools, such as natural language processing and phecodes, to identify TAY/adults with ASD and co-occurring conditions and (2) Learn how to analyze longitudinal health data. I will obtain this training through mentorship provided by Dr. Lisa Croen of KPNC and Drs. Jeffrey Neul and Lea Davis of VUMC as I conduct my research project. Formal coursework in Bioinformatics and Epidemiology, along with Responsible Conduct of Research, will enhance my practical experience. The environment provided by VUMC and KPNC is ideal for this training, given the expertise of both institutions in cutting-edge EHR-related research. The project is innovative given the proposed use of novel tools for identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and the proposed analysis of longitudinal EHR data related to health conditions and health care utilization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Increased prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is accompanied by a rising tide of adolescents with ASD who are entering adulthood and have complex healthcare needs Testing the effectiveness of provider training models to care for transition age youth (TAY) and adults with ASD requires skills in (1) identification and characterization of TAY/adults with ASD, and (2) analysis of longitudinal data on health conditions and health care utilization. In this K18, Dr. Malow will learn these critical skills through the use of two existing datasets, thereby equipping her to design rigorous studies of provider-based interventions aimed at improving health care in TAY and adults with ASD.",Harnessing Electronic Health Records to Identify Participants and to Study Health Outcomes in Transition-Age Youth and Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder,9961921,K18MH122755,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-18 conjugate', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Perception', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Videoconferencing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'design', 'effectiveness testing', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'novel', 'patient population', 'physical conditioning', 'provider networks', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'telehealth', 'tool']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K18,2020,171030,0.07360028758526706
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9998993,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'visual tracking', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2368051,0.07248105052636028
"Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development, revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as 1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at 36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants, and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by atypical social communication and behavioral repertoire. The current studies aim to reveal how sensorimotor impairments may underlie, contribute, and regulate the neurobiology of this condition in toddlers recruited from the general population during the 2nd year of life and who were assessed for ASD vs. non-ASD outcomes during the 3rd year of life. Features of the neurobiologically grounded subtypes of ASD developed as part of this proposal will be used in future studies to predict diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in children with low-functioning form of ASD, those at risk for developing ASD, and those children with related disorders of neurodevelopment.",Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers,9866342,R01MH121605,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sensorimotor system', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2020,366973,0.17401287330005263
"Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders ABSTRACT Developmental speech and language disorders affect an estimated 15% of children and have lifelong impacts on social and emotional development and employment. Two common neurodevelopmental disorders are developmental language disorder (DLD; also called specific language impairment) and developmental stuttering, affecting 7% and 5% of children respectively. Despite their prevalence and immense impact, little is known of the neural causes, correlates, and consequences of these common neurodevelopmental disorders; thus, effective treatment remains elusive. In the proposed project, we will study the neural underpinnings of these disorders using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study structural and functional neural connectivity. Previous studies of connectivity in these populations are limited and show little consensus, likely due in part to small sample sizes. Theoretical accounts of both disorders implicate dysfunctional neural circuits through the basal ganglia. In the current proposal, we will test and compare the structural and functional integrity of neural pathways in large cohorts of people with DLD (N=80) and people who stutter (PWS; N=80) and compare them with similar data obtained in age- and sex-matched control groups of people with typical development (N=160). First, we will assess connectivity in speech/language-specific networks, using diffusion data to assess structural connectivity and resting-state data to assess functional connectivity. Results will indicate abnormalities in connectivity in large cohorts of PWS and people with DLD. In each disorder, we will also determine connectivity contributions to individual differences in behavior. This will reveal how different connectivity patterns are correlated to differences in severity along relevant dimensions (e.g., fluency, language measures), ideally resulting in neural correlates of the disorders. Finally, we will evaluate whole-brain functional connectivity differences between each disorder group and its matched control group using data-driven machine learning approaches. Results will indicate patterns of neural activity that differentiate these disorders from controls. The outcome of this proposal will be the characterization of underlying network differences in these populations, which will ideally lead to the development of targeted behavioral and neuro-modulatory treatments of these multifaceted and pervasive disorders. Research and training will take place at the University of Oxford, an ideal environment in which to pursue this line of research. The applicant will be mentored by world-leading researchers with the knowledge needed to guide him in this work, including expertise in the neural bases of developmental speech and language disorders, cutting-edge methodology in neuroimaging, and machine learning. Achieving these aims will illuminate the neural correlates of these speech and language disorders as well as prepare the applicant for an independent research career in this area. PROJECT NARRATIVE For a surprisingly large number of children, as many as 15%, speech and language development does not go smoothly and results in disorders such as stuttering or language delay. We wish to understand more about the causes of these common disorders and will assess whether the brain networks involved in speech and language development are impaired in people with developmental language disorder and stuttering. Using large existing neuroimaging datasets obtained in these disorders will allow us to address important questions about the causes and consequences of these developmental disorders.",Structural and functional connectivity markers of developmental speech and language disorders,9944309,F32DC017637,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Employment', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Development Disorders', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Motor', 'Network-based', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Speech Development', 'Speech Disorders', 'Structure', 'Stuttering', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'caudate nucleus', 'cohort', 'developmental disease', 'disorder control', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'language impairment', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'specific language impairment', 'standardize measure']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,F32,2020,69426,-0.050136803290134736
"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD,10066250,F32MH122057,"['11 year old', '13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anxious', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'course development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early adolescence', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'symptomatology', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F32,2020,67254,0.12378720781904953
"1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check‐ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well‐baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6‐10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check‐ ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12‐24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early‐detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state‐level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program. Success of this large and clinically valid first-of-its-kind work will spark more such studies of this vital question, and through that, future pediatric best-practices guidelines for age of detection and treatment of ASD can be properly based on objective evidence and implemented nation-wide.",1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD,9867001,R01MH121595,"['Academy', 'Achievement', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Characteristics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Language', 'Laws', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Massachusetts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Work', 'age effect', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'screening', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,1421697,0.07784756691173524

"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",9797688,R44MH118763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurobehavioral test', 'patient variability', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2020,1081815,0.09673132555461401
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,9960583,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'hemodynamics', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,796501,0.09479439448164691
"Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous genetic etiology and behavioral symptomatology. While recent genetics research suggests that the cumulative effects of many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on many genes confer increased risk of ASD, very little is known about how additive genetic risk impacts brain function and structure. My dissertation work leverages variation at the genetic, neural, and behavioral levels by investigating how cumulative genetic risk for ASD on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts network-level activity and connectivity in brain regions critical for social reward processing, and how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology. Results of my first dissertation study have shown that OXTR risk-allele dosage modulates resting-state connectivity of the reward network in both youth with ASD and typically developing (TD) youth, although in different ways. In youth with ASD, greater OXTR risk is associated with reduced connectivity between nodes of the reward circuit and greater symptom severity. Conversely, in TD youth, greater OXTR risk-allele dosage is associated with greater connectivity between the reward network and frontal brain regions involved in mentalizing and this, in turn, is associated with better social functioning (Hernandez et al., 2016a). These findings in TD youth suggest a compensatory neural mechanism in the face of increased genetic risk for ASD, and raise further questions about the role of other genetic (i.e., epistatic) and environmental/experiential variables in steering development along typical vs. atypical trajectories. My ongoing dissertation study examines the moderating effects of diagnosis and gender on the relationship between OXTR risk-allele dosage and neural processing of social rewards using functional neuroimaging (fMRI). While I have gained strong expertise in connectivity-based neuroimaging, genetics, and the neurobiology of ASD, my last dissertation project will provide additional training in analysis of task-related fMRI data and assessment of changes in task-based functional connectivity (i.e., training in psychophysiological interaction analyses). My dissertation work thus far highlights how little is known about the mechanisms by which individuals with the same genetic risk for mental illness have different outcomes (i.e., affected vs. resilient). As a post-doctoral researcher, I aim to gain additional training in the assessment of environmental and experiential variables that affect neurodevelopmental outcomes, as well as in advanced data-analytic approaches to model multilevel interactions between gene-brain-environment measures (e.g., statistical analysis of longitudinal data, machine learning algorithms, imaging-genetics of genome-wide data) with the ultimate goal of combining these data to better predict risk for mental illness and inform interventions. These aims are in line with the NIH Blueprint for NIMH, NICHD, and NINDS, as they seek to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying complex human behavior and neurodevelopmental disorders. Project Narrative The proposed dissertation research examines how cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on a gene implicated in social behavior across species – the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) – impacts brain activity and connectivity in youth with and without ASD, as well as how risk-allele dosage relates to individual differences in ASD symptomatology and social functioning. Future postdoctoral research will investigate how genetic, environmental, and experiential factors impact neurodevelopmental trajectories with a focus on adolescence, a period during which many psychiatric disorders emerge. A better understanding of how complex gene-brain-environment interactions confer vulnerability or resilience to mental illness may lead to earlier diagnosis, more efficacious treatment, and improved outcome.",Gene-brain-environment interactions as determinants of typical and atypical developmental trajectories,10006102,K00MH119663,"['Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Oxytocin', 'Oxytocin Receptor', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychophysiology', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobehavior', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'dosage', 'endophenotype', 'frontal lobe', 'gender difference', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging genetics', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'outcome forecast', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'reward circuitry', 'reward processing', 'risk variant', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'task analysis']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K00,2020,86880,0.07629037946815549
"Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 59 children in the United States1 and incurs substantial public health burden over the lifespan2. Although one of the strongest predictors of later independence for individuals with ASD is early language ability3,4, the mechanisms underlying disrupted language development in ASD are not well understood. Recent research indicates that the transition from crawling to walking represents a sensitive period for language development, during which infants with ASD exhibit atypical trajectories of language growth. For typically-developing (TD) infants, walk onset is closely linked with a sudden increase in infants’ rate of language acquisition5–8 and dramatic changes in how infants perceive and interact with their environment. Emerging evidence indicates that infants with ASD do not exhibit the same “spurt” in language development following walk onset as their TD peers5, but reasons for this difference are not yet known. We propose that gait control, the ability to effectively regulate and coordinate the rhythmic movements needed for walking, is a fundamental mechanism supporting language growth following walk onset that is impaired in infants with ASD. Poor gait control may impede language acquisition after walk onset by making it difficult for children to access the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords, including seeing more faces9 and having hands free to gesture10 and share objects with others11,12. Regions of the brain known to support gait and postural control exhibit atypical structure and function in individuals with ASD13,14, and older children and adults with ASD exhibit poorer gait control15–17, indicating that gait control may be fundamentally disrupted in ASD. However, no studies to date have prospectively assessed early gait control in infants with ASD. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate gait control as a potential mechanism linking ASD to change in the rate of language growth after walk onset. This study will test whether gait control 4 weeks after walk onset (measured by a pressure- sensitive gait mat) predicts change in the rate of language growth following walk onset in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD (Aim 1). Next, we will examine whether ASD symptoms at 24 months are associated with gait control after walk onset (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed study will also explore whether innovative computer vision technology can provide an infant gait assessment tool that is more scalable to settings outside the lab than current gold-standard pressure-sensitive gait mats (Aim 3). This study will be the first to explicitly test the relationships between gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms. In so doing, it will yield a deeper understanding of the link between early motor and language development during this sensitive period, with the potential to identify possible targets for early intervention to promote improved language outcomes in infants with ASD. Taken together, this project and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a research career investigating the early motor and social communication development in ASD. Project Narrative Learning to walk is associated with a significant increase in the rate of language development for typically- developing infants, but not for infants who go on to receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While the reasons for this difference remain unclear, previous research indicates that children and adults with ASD are impaired in their ability to control the gross motor movements involved in walking, which may impede their ability to take advantage of the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords. By (1) prospectively testing the relationship between early gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms, and (2) developing a scalable computer vision tool for the automatic assessment of infant gait, the proposed study will investigate gait control as a potential mechanism contributing to disrupted language growth in ASD and make it possible to identify and study early gait impairment on an unprecedented scale.",Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder,9989998,F31MH123033,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain region', 'Calendar', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Chiroptera', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Periodicity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Walking', 'Width', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'career', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'language outcome', 'peer', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.18474608503122558
"Adapting Biomarker Assays for Individuals with Autism and Intellectual Disability Project Summary/Abstract The field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research lacks objective, sensitive quantifications of symptomatology with sufficient evidence to justify use as biomarkers in clinical trials. In the current proposal we investigate two promising markers, neural response to faces, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG), and visual attention to faces, measured by eye-tracking (ET). Published work and our preliminary data indicate that these measures: reflect clinically meaningful differences in the core symptoms of ASD, both by discriminating groups with ASD from those with typical development (TD) and by correlating with symptomatology in individuals with ASD; have strong test-retest reliability; demonstrate sensitivity to change in clinical status, both in the context of pharmacological and behavioral intervention; are collected by objective, automated tools not vulnerable to issues associated with inter-rater or inter-operator reliability; are minimally invasive and highly tolerable and therefore applicable across a wide range of ages and functional levels, with acceptable burden for participants and families; are collected using economical and accessible technologies that are scalable for large multisite studies with potential utility in the near term. Despite the promise of these biomarkers, their appropriateness in individuals with ASD and intellectual disability (ASD+ID) is poorly understood. In this application, we propose a novel integration of technologies and an innovative experimental approach to investigate these promising biomarkers in this critically understudied population. We leverage two complementary lines of research developed by the PIs: Dr. McPartland's Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT), a multisite study collecting large samples of highly reliable EEG and ET data in children with ASD, and Dr. Naples' suite of gaze- and behaviorally-contingent technologies permitting concurrent collection of ET and EEG data in individuals with severe ID. The proposed work will incorporate robust ABC-CT experiments into an innovative experimental approach to study 30 6-11 year old children with ASD+ID and a matched sample of 30 individuals with ID without ASD. We test the hypotheses that individuals with ASD+ID will display longer latency of the N170 event-related potential (ERP) to human faces and reduced proportion of looking time to human faces in static social scenes relative to individuals with ID without ASD and that face N170 and visual attention to faces will correlate with clinician and caregiver ratings of social- communicative function. This innovative project uses a suite of contingent technologies to acclimate participants to the testing environment and apparatus, to attenuate motion, to permit real time feedback on data quality to prioritize stimulus delivery, and to support post-processing of motion artifact using computer vision derived motion estimates. By adapting robust markers for administration to individuals with ASD and ID, this application holds promise for development of biomarkers viable in an understudied but critically important segment of the autism spectrum.

"Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum (CICADAS) PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness CICADAS (Care Improving Cognition for ADolescents on the Autism Spectrum)—a clinician-assisted, closed-loop technology, mobile application for adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Via ten mobile assessments CICADAS will capture data on sensory processing abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits. These data will populate a machine learning algorithm that will tailor the delivery of ten neuroplasticity-based social cognitive training (NB-SCT) exercises targeting sensory processing abnormalities. This individualized assessment and treatment approach is posited to induce adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, thus maximizing the impact and generalizability of psychological Evidence Based Treatments targeting social skills and relational strategies, including PEERS (Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relationship Skills). In particular, we posit that CICADAS-induced enhancement of processing and cognition will facilitate the application of PEERS skills in the environment of adolescents with ASD, thus improving their real- world functioning. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and accumulate preliminary evidence for CICADAS to function as 1) a stand-alone treatment; 2) a primer for PEERS; 3) an enhancer for PEERS. In Specific Aim 1, we will finalize development, ensuring that assessment data correctly populate the closed- loop algorithm and correctly guide the delivery of individualized NB-SCT. Next, we will involve three adolescents with ASD and two PEERS clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine CICADAS. Once decisions regarding app design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run to verify that CICADAS is detecting and improving sensory processing abnormalities and cognitive deficits. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that CICADAS is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, we will conduct a three-arm randomized crossover trial with 48 adolescents with ASD to document the acceptability of CICADAS and evaluate its potential as a stand-alone treatment, as a primer for PEERS, or as a treatment enhancer of PEERS. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support an efficacy trial in Phase II designed to establish medical claims. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition.

"The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment PROJECT SUMMARY  Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered. However, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here, 24-36 months) contributes to a high rate of false positives, impeding accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model of toddler PLI risk. Innovations introduced in this developmentally-sensitive, translational approach include: (1) a developmental precursor model using state-of-the-art methods to characterize multiple features and growth patterns of toddler emergent language patterns, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language and transactional synchrony into PLI predictive models; and (3) considering emergent mental health risk. Mental health risk is captured via multi-method measures of irritability, a developmentally meaningful marker of risk for internalizing and externalizing problems that are common correlates of PLI. The proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) will capitalize on the team's existed funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a new sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24 month olds, followed to age 54 months (when PLI can be reliably evaluated). The key predictor will be toddler emergent language patterns measured via language skill, language processing, and corollary neural biomarkers. The central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age, assessed via clinical gold standard measures. Key risk modifiers are distal and proximal features of the transactional language environment, and longitudinal patterns of irritability.  SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Specify the contribution of language skills, processing, neural biomarkers, and their growth to early PLI prediction. Hypotheses: 1a. Language skills, processing, and neural biomarkers will each contribute incrementally to PLI prediction. 1b. Considering longitudinal patterns will enhance prediction. Aim 2. Identify the distal risk- and proximal protective- features of the transactional language environment that provide greatest explanatory power for individual differences in PLI. Hypothesis 2: Family history and poor parental language ability will increase PLI risk, and features of parental input, and behavioral and neural synchrony will decrease PLI risk. Aim 3. Examine the mutual influences of toddler irritability, proximal language environment, and emergent language patterns on PLI pathways. Hypothesis 3: A model specifying these reciprocal influences over time will sharpen PLI prediction beyond variance explained by their individual influences. Aim 4. Evaluate feasibility of a clinical algorithm for earlier PLI risk identification. We will use machine learning approaches to generate a sensitive/specific, feasible clinical model building on Aims 1-3. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment (PLI) emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, identification in toddlers is not currently possible because of the high rate of false positives reflecting transient language delays. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, neurodevelopmental approach to generate earlier, more accurate identification of toddler risk for persistent PLI via: (a) multi-faceted, longitudinal assessment of toddler emergent language patterns; (b) detailed consideration of the transactional language environment; and (c) accounting for emergent health risk in predictive models. Earlier, reliable identification of toddlers at highest risk for PLI will optimize early intervention to prevent developmentally- cascading effects.",The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L): Joint consideration of developmental patterning and neural substrates for enhancing earlyidentification of language impairment,9875268,R01DC016273,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'model building', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'standard measure', 'translational approach', 'visual tracking']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,585545,0.059919396465953456
"Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder Abstract The goal of this R03 is to characterize longitudinal vocal development in infants and toddlers at risk for ASD and use these metrics to predict subsequent diagnosis and dimensional social/language abilities. There is a critical need for reliable markers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can be used to detect the condition in infancy and hasten the onset of early intervention services. Preliminary data from our team indicates that infant vocalization features distinguish groups beginning in the first year of life, and account for significant variance in later diagnostic status and social/language phenotype. For example, we found that infants later diagnosed with ASD produce fewer speech-like vocalizations, fewer vocalizations directed toward others, more crying, and altered vocalization acoustics. However, the longitudinal development of these early-emerging differences has not been completely described, and while they hold promise as early markers, their ability to predict individual clinical outcomes has not been directly tested in a large sample. Therefore, the power of these early vocalization differences to improve clinical detection has not been fully harnessed. To address this gap, we leverage a large existing dataset collected through the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS; NICHD R01HD055741, PI: Dr. Joseph Piven). In this successful longitudinal multi-site study, infants at high and low familial risk for ASD completed video-recorded behavioral assessments at 6, 12, and 24 months of age, as well as neuroimaging at the same time points. Our research plan includes annotating infant vocalizations produced during these interactions using an expanded version of a coding scheme we have already developed, manualized, and trained annotators to reliably implement, and measuring the acoustic properties of each annotated vocalization. In Aim 1, we will use mixed models to analyze developmental group differences in vocalization features, determining which qualities distinguish groups and when. In Aim 2, we will use machine learning to test whether vocalization features produced during the first year of life can accurately predict diagnostic and social/language outcomes at age 2. This work will provide evidence of the clinical utility of infant vocalizations as pre-diagnostic behavioral biomarkers, setting the stage for subsequent studies of the relationship between early vocal behavior and brain development (measured using previously collected neuroimaging data from the same participants). The  Project Narrative This R03 proposal tackles a persistent public health challenge – detecting autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during infancy – by identifying characteristics of infant vocalizations that predict whether a given child will develop the condition. To achieve this goal, we use computational linguistics and machine learning to analyze existing audio/video recordings from a large longitudinal cohort of infants at high and low risk for autism. This work has high public health relevance because it aims to identify markers that improve early identification of ASD, which is essential for initiating early intervention services and improving long-term functional outcomes.",Infant Vocalizations as Early Markers of Autism Spectrum Disorder,9894787,R03DC017944,"['2 year old', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Laughter', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States', 'Video Recording', 'Videotape', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biobehavior', 'clinically relevant', 'early onset', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'language outcome', 'neuroimaging', 'peer', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'service intervention', 'social', 'success', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R03,2020,88000,0.13358174134036369
"Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research is now tracking early infant vocal communication using all-day recordings evaluated with human coding and in limited cases with automated analysis at very large scales. Results reveal unexpected features of development, illustrating foundations of language. Much of this work conducted at the University of Memphis (UM) is founded in an infrastructural theory of language development that has produced notable successes by supplying a widely-used stage model of vocal development and by providing the basis for determining clinically useful markers, especially associated with the onset and consolidation of canonical babbling (CB), a key foundation for spoken language. The UM empirical work within the infrastructural framework, based primarily on human-coding of longitudinal all-day recordings, has also begun to produce a new account of vocal foundations and vocal interaction both in the 1st months after full-term birth and in infants born prematurely by >2 months and still in the hospital. This work points toward possible indicators of risk for disorders in the first months of life. Further development of the new account holds promise for illuminating the development of vocal language and supplying predictors for conditions such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD).  The proposed research will expand the UM effort to much larger scale and address prediction of language development and of ASD through an ASD sibling study. The work will combine forces between the UM and Emory University's Marcus Autism Center (MAC), which both independently and through its Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Program Project from NIH, is in the process of collecting a massive set of longitudinal all-day recordings of infants 1) showing typical development (TD), 2) at risk for ASD because they have an older sibling with ASD, and 3) at risk for language delay (LD) due to low socioeconomic status (SES). The MAC/ACE research includes analysis of the recordings with automated acoustic methods, but does not include funding for human coding of the massive recording set. Extensive human coding is in fact crucial for the ACE project, because without it, there is insufficient gold-standard data in terms of which to advance the accuracy and relevance of automated methods for developmental prediction and for detection of developmental communication disorders. Furthermore, many aspects of vocal patterning and interaction are as yet simply not accessible by automated means-human coding is the only workable option. The proposed research will combine efforts of UM and MAC, with 1) MAC supplying longitudinal all-day recordings across the 1st year of life to UM from the 3 groups, 2) UM performing coding and human-assisted acoustic analysis on representatively sampled segments from the recordings, and 3) both sites working together to predict infant outcomes at 24 months based on the human coding/analysis and based on the automated analysis that will result from supervised machine learning made possible by the human coding/analysis. The work targets improving prediction of language development and early identification of ASD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work will provide scientific foundations on vocal development and language in three groups of children, including ASD siblings, infants of low SES, and controls (low risk). The work will lay new foundations for automated large-scale monitoring of infant vocalizations.",Infant Vocal Communication: Typical Development and Autism Risk,9820723,R01DC015108,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Caregivers', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Early identification', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infrastructure', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Social Development', 'Socialization', 'Term Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'hearing impairment', 'human model', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'infant outcome', 'insight', 'language outcome', 'longitudinal database', 'low socioeconomic status', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'social', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R01,2020,504913,0.13510670296070226
"Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L) PROJECT SUMMARY – Original Submission Primary language impairment (PLI) begins early in life and affects 6-8% of children. Although language intervention is maximally effective the earlier it is delivered, normative variation in language acquisition across toddlerhood (here 24-36 months) impedes accurate identification of PLI prior to late preschool age. The proposed study introduces a novel, theoretically- grounded, neurodevelopmental framework designed to generate a sensitive and specific model to identify PLI as early as possible. Our developmentally- sensitive, translational approach introduces multiple innovations including: (1) characterizing the developmental patterning of toddler emergent language beginning at 24 mos. using state-of-the-art methods, within a large community sample; (2) incorporating EEG/ERP neural biomarkers of language into PLI risk assessment; (3) using a novel paradigm to assess the protective effects of both behavioral and neural synchronization within parent-child language transactions; and (4) consideration of irritability, a robust developmental marker of early mental health risk, to enhance identification of those language delayed toddlers at highest risk for persistence. For the proposed When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L), we capitalize on our funded study of 350 infants (50% irritable and 50% non-irritable) (R01MH107652, Wakschlag, PI) and enrich it via recruitment of a sub-sample of 200 late talking toddlers. This will yield a large and diverse sample of 550 24-month-olds. Our key predictors will be toddler emergent language patterns (24-36 months), their neural biomarkers and synchrony within the transactional language environment. Our central outcome is primary language impairment (PLI) status at preschool age (54 mos., when PLI can be reliably evaluated), assessed via clinical gold standard expressive and receptive language abilities. SPECIFIC AIMS: AIM 1a. Evaluate accuracy of PLI prediction based on multi-component measures of language including intensive longitudinal assessments of toddler developmental precursors of key language functions at older ages, neural biomarkers. We will assess neural and linguistic processing via quantitative EEG during parent-child interaction and ERPs to speech sounds as well as during eye tracking tasks and 1b. Evaluate feasibility of creating an algorithm for early identification of PLI that can be applied in clinical practice, using cross-validation and machine learning. AIM 2: Test the hypothesis that parent-child dyadic synchrony buffers PLI risk For the first time, we combine behavioral and novel social EEG measures of parent-child synchrony during natural interaction and a custom-designed word learning task to directly test how observed (behavioral) and neural (EEG) dyadic synchrony impact word learning. AIM 3: Test whether consideration of toddler irritability enhances PLI prediction. In sum, PLI confers sustained negative effects on a variety of personal-social and academic outcomes. Pinpointing children at highest risk for PLI is critical for reducing the public health burden of PLI for children, families, and the systems supporting them, and enhancing targeted allocation of resources. PROJECT NARRATIVE Primary language impairment emerges early and is responsive to intervention; however, many toddlers with early language delays recover naturally, and others who appear to be developing typically show signs of impairment by preschool age. We use a novel, theoretically-grounded, multi-level neurodevelopmental approach to characterize emergent language patterns from 24- 36 mos. along with the influence of neural and linguistic processing and transactional processes within the child's broader language environment. We also test whether PLI prediction is enhanced via consideration of irritability, a robust predictor of early mental health risk. Drawing on findings from our predictive models, we will also examine feasibility of developing a clinical algorithm from this scientifically-validated toolkit. Generating reliable methods for accurate identification of young children at highest risk for language impairment lays the foundation for optimizing early intervention and preventing developmentally-cascading effects on academic and adaptive functioning.",Administrative Supplement to The When to Worry about Language Study (W2W-L),10162280,R01DC016273,"['Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Human Subject Research', 'Illinois', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institutes', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Language Delays', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Parent-Child Relations', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Activity', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Support System', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Transact', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'standard measure', 'stress reduction', 'translational approach', 'tv watching', 'visual tracking', 'word learning']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,197084,0.07075453119159426
"Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment ABSTRACT – Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and  early treatment Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) occurs in ~40-60% of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substantially contributes to poorer clinical outcomes. Yet, very little research has focused on the overlap of ASD and ADHD during early childhood. Thus, little is known about how these two conditions co- emerge early in life. Given the high prevalence and clinical impact of the comorbidity of ASD and ADHD, the overall goal of the Duke Autism Center of Excellence is to characterize how co-occurring ADHD influences early screening, neural signatures, developmental trajectories, and response to early treatment of young children with ASD. Project 1 will characterize risk factors for and emergence of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in young children at risk for ASD and examine how these symptoms influence early detection and progression of ASD. This project will clarify why children who have co-occurring ADHD are diagnosed at a much later age and inform more effective early detection strategies. Following a large sample of toddlers receiving routine care in Duke pediatric primary clinics (N = ~ 2800 patients/year), Project 1 will prospectively identify children at risk for ASD and collect data on risk factors, ADHD, and developmental outcomes. Project 2 will elucidate shared and distinct neural signatures and attention-related biomarkers related to ASD and ADHD, examine the functional impact of co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD, and identify precursor characteristics during infancy that are predictive of later emergence of comorbid ASD and ADHD. This project will characterize children with ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ADHD alone, and typically-developing children, using state-of-the-art methods, including neurophysiology, eye-tracking, movement-tracking, and computer vision analysis. Project 3 will evaluate a novel early intervention model personalized for young children with ASD+ADHD that pharmacologically addresses ADHD symptoms prior to initiating early behavioral intervention, and identify changes in behavioral and neurophysiological activity that may underlie response to treatment. This project will accomplish these goals by evaluating whether stimulant treatment (Adzenys-XR-ODT) augments the efficacy of a parent-delivered behavioral intervention based on the Early Start Denver Model. This project will examine whether changes in outcome are correlated with improvements in social attention, measured via eye-tracking biomarkers, and social engagement during parent-child interaction. This project will also examine neurophysiological changes underlying improvements in behavior. These projects will be supported by four cores: Administrative Core, Recruitment and Assessment Core, Data Management and Analysis Core, and Dissemination and Outreach Core. Functioning as a whole, the Duke Autism Center of Excellence will offer the most comprehensive understanding to date of the impact of ADHD on young children with ASD, providing important information that will allow for biologically informed and personalized methods for early detection and treatment that could mitigate the negative impact of co-occurring ADHD on individuals with ASD.   PROJECT NARRATIVE - Co-occurring ADHD in young children with ASD: Precursors, detection, neural signatures, and early treatment Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 individuals in the U.S. and has an annual estimated cost of $126 billion. In ~40-60% of people with ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also occurs and is associated with later ASD diagnosis, delayed access to intervention, and substantially poorer clinical outcomes.

"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs).

"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",9967099,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2020,3628784,0.07699434602754598
"Cerebellar connectivity and error-based learning in infants at risk for autism Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder diagnosed on the basis of social impairment and restricted, repetitive behaviors 7. To combat these behavioral liabilities, effective interventions are needed. Early interventions appear particularly promising given evidence that engaging in therapies by 18-24 months improves outcomes for individuals with ASD 8–11. However, prospective research in infants at high risk for ASD has shown that the defining behavioral features of ASD are not present during the first year of life 12. Thus, very early intervention will rely on the identification of reliable presymptomatic biomarkers. In service of this objective, we propose to interrogate cerebellar functional connectivity and error-based learning (EBL) impairment as developmentally-linked neural and physiological presymptomatic biomarkers, respectively, of ASD. Converging evidence from multiple areas of research indicates a role for the cerebellum in ASD 13–15, a role for the cerebellum in EBL 16–18, and a role for EBL in ASD 19,20. However, the directionality and timing of early developmental relationships among these constructs remains poorly understood. This is a notable gap in the literature, given that ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with defining behavioral features that emerge and consolidate across the first 12 and 36 months of life 21. To test the hypothesis that cerebellar connectivity and EBL contribute to the development of ASD, it is necessary to study infants prior to ASD diagnosis. To this end, we propose to analyze previously-collected resting-state functional connectivity (fcMRI) and eye-tracking (EBL) data from the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), a multisite study of brain and behavioral development in infants at high and low risk for ASD. Specifically, we will evaluate cerebellar connectivity and EBL impairment as longitudinal predictors of ASD diagnosis and severity, as well as dimensionally-measured ASD-associated behaviors. Consistent with prior research 22, we will operationalize EBL as saccadic error (i.e., the frequency, magnitude, and variability of eye movements that fall short of their intended targets). We hypothesize that infant cerebellar connectivity (Aim 1) and EBL impairment (Aim 2) will predict later ASD diagnosis and severity. Further, consistent with “cascade” models of brain-behavior development 23, we hypothesize that infant cerebellar connectivity will influence infant EBL, with implications for ASD outcomes (Aim 3). Findings to support our hypotheses would identify cerebellar functional connectivity and EBL impairment as presymptomatic biomarkers for ASD, facilitating early diagnosis in ASD and helping to pave the way for randomized control trials of presymptomatic interventions. Ultimately, my long-term career goal is to become an independent academic researcher investigating the neural, physiological, and psychological factors that contribute to the development of ASD. This proposal entails trainings in infant neuroimaging and eye-tracking from leading experts in both fields, including sponsor John Pruett and co-sponsor Jed Elison. It will serve as the perfect capstone to my graduate studies, and I intend for it to launch the next stage in my research career. Project Narrative The defining behavioral features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not present during the first year of life and, therefore, very early intervention—which is argued to improve outcomes for individuals with ASD—will rely on the identification of reliable presymptomatic biomarkers. Using whole-brain approaches, our group recently identified two neural biomarkers that predict ASD diagnosis with high positive predictive value (PPV > 80%). We will examine the mechanistic bases for these findings by testing whether abnormal infant cerebellar connectivity (a specific neural biomarker) and cerebellar-dependent learning (a related physiological biomarker) predict later ASD outcomes, with implications for the development of targeted presymptomatic interventions.",Cerebellar connectivity and error-based learning in infants at risk for autism,9987929,F31MH120918,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Expectancy', 'Eye Movements', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'combat', 'control trial', 'cost', 'early screening', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'falls', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'imaging study', 'improved outcome', 'infancy', 'joint attention', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,36300,0.16604193516948346
"Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype Abstract  Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and differences have also been observed more subtly in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP; a cluster of subclinical features related to ASD, which are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Prosody is a central component of pragmatics, which includes aspects of speech and language that modulate and enhance meaning at grammatical, pragmatic, and affective levels including stress and intonation, which are conveyed by changes in fundamental frequency, intensity, and rate. Atypical prosody in ASD has been identified as the most prominent feature that immediately identifies an individual with ASD as “odd” compared to typically developing peers, causing significant obstacles to social interaction and integration1-3. More subtle differences in prosody have also been observed among parents of individuals with ASD, and may serve as a key marker of ASD genetic risk, measurable in affected and unaffected individuals. Because speech samples may be easily obtained, identification of key prosodic profiles in ASD and profiles reflecting genetic liability to ASD, could have widespread implication as a biomarker for detection of ASD risk, and as a tool for assessment and interventions focused on this clinically significant feature of ASD. Limitations in current work pose significant barriers to the objective and efficient characterization of prosody, where current methods typically rely on subjective perceptual ratings which, though clinically valid, are difficult to obtain and apply objectively in treatment contexts, and are unfeasible for application with large samples. Moreover, without extensive training, perceptual rating methods are not adequately sensitive for capturing important variation and heterogeneity in ASD prosodic profiles, or identifying the often quite subtle yet biologically meaningful prosodic differences that may be observed in clinically unaffected relatives. These factors together impose substantial barriers to reproducibility, limit scalability, and render prosodic characterization unfeasible for use by clinicians. This project attempts to address these challenges by applying sophisticated computational modeling of extensive existing speech and language samples collected through a larger companion project (R01DC010191, PI: Losh), to characterize prosodic profiles in ASD and in parents. In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate evidence of distinct prosodic profiles of individuals with ASD and parents, along with relationships to broader pragmatic language abilities and neural processing of speech sounds in ASD and parents, supporting the goals of this project to apply sophisticated computational tools to speech data obtained across multiple contexts in order to 1) identify prosodic profiles that characterize ASD and the BAP in parents, and 2) examine how prosodic profiles relate to broader clinical-behavioral phenotypes, and aggregate within families, potentially contributing phenotypic signatures of clinically and etiologically more homogeneous subgroups. Project Narrative Difficulty with the social use of language, including impairments in the rhythmic and intonational features of language used to convey intention and emotions that are essential for establishing connections with social partners, is a hallmark of ASD. Subtle differences in these language features have been observed among clinically unaffected relatives as well, and might serve as subclinical markers of genetic risk to ASD. This project aims to provide clinically and biologically meaningful measures of such language differences, using state-of-the- art computational modeling of social language characteristics in ASD, to inform clinical assessment, treatment, and biological studies of ASD.",Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype,9958980,R03DC018644,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Companions', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'speech processing', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,74383,0.1288831626475319
"A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Project Summary Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also occur across a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders. RRB present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, interfere with family functioning and present a source of considerable stress for parents. Despite their clinical significance, underlying mechanisms behind this complex behavioral domain are poorly understood and effective, targeted, individually tailored treatment options are currently lacking. One of the major barriers to moving the RRB research agenda forward has been the lack of clarity around the structure and conceptualization of RRB and the limitations of the currently available measures, particularly in terms of their (i) inability to comprehensively capture the full range of RRB and (ii) lack of sensitivity to treatment-related change. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a parent report measure for comprehensive and quantitative RRB assessment applicable across clinical populations and across the life- span and useful in both etiological- and treatment-related research. In order to achieve this goal, we will first conduct advanced statistical analyses of multiple, large, high-quality datasets containing a range of currently available measures in order to achieve fine-grained differentiation between distinct RRB domains (Specific Aim 1) and to identify domains not adequately captured by the current measures (Specific Aim 2). The implementation of this initial phase of the project will ensure that robustness and generalizability of the factor structures for each individual measure across age, developmental level, gender, and diagnostic status, is established and that generalizable core RRB structure across the currently available RRB instruments is identified. Neither of these two different aspects have been comprehensively addressed before. Robust derived RRB factor structure, together with the identification of potential RRB domains that might be under- represented and not adequately depicted by the current instruments, together with the systematic review of the literature will inform the development of items of the new scale to capture the full range of RRB. The pilot version of the new scale will be psychometrically evaluated online within a large sample of children and adolescents with ASD (Specific Aim 3). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations aimed at further refinement of the newly developed informant-based scale and the development of a clinician interview and objective instrument, as well as their validation across ASD ansd neurodevelopmental disorders, and the testing of their utility as a clinical outcome measure. Project Narrative Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB), a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, and a source of stress and management challenges for families. In addition to utilizing existing large datasets to clarify the structure of RRB and develop comprehensive RRB taxonomy, this project will utilize the information gained from the innovative secondary data analysis to develop and pilot a newly developed comprehensive and sensitive RRB scale. This project will pave the way for new studies that will aim to further validate the new measure, explore its sensitivity to change and utility as an outcome in clinical trials and inform the development of new clinical observation and objective measurement tools.",A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors,9874787,R21MH121876,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'clinically significant', 'compulsion', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'informant', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'motor behavior', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'stress management', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,236550,0.056673038037983445
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,9881344,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,782692,0.053172045018706
"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern. This proposal will provide novel insight into the neurobiological basis of ASD by assessing brain functioning during conditions that more closely approximate the complex processing demands of the real world.",Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD,9841460,R01MH110630,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'candidate marker', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'comparative', 'expectation', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'movie', 'multidimensional data', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'potential biomarker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'stimulus processing']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2020,426957,0.038643475502380044
"Auditory precursors of language delay in toddlers with autism spectrum disorders Abstract Language delay and impairments are common in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), as are sensory (including auditory) anomalies. Since acquisition of spoken language relies on the integrity of the auditory system, language delay and impairments may be related to sound processing abnormalities that are frequently observed in children with ASDs (despite normal peripheral hearing). However, it is not understood if and how early auditory brain anomalies may developmentally contribute to impaired language development.  This project will examine the maturation of auditory and language systems in the brain across early childhood, during the critical period for language acquisition. We will employ a longitudinal design and multimodal neuroimaging, including high-resolution anatomical, diffusion, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with added frequent and extensive behavioral and neuropsychological assessments. Our central hypothesis is that early disruptions to cortical sound processing precede and predict language impairments in ASDs and may thus be considered causal contributors – a hypothesis that has been frequently considered in the literature, but never tested at the neural level.  Our aims are to thoroughly characterize the structural integrity and functional differentiation of the cortical auditory and language systems (Aim 1) and their maturational trajectories (Aim 2) in toddlers with ASDs and age-matched typically developing peers. This will allow us to establish whether neural abnormalities in cortical processing of complex sounds in toddlers are predictive of language development and social behavior at the pre-school age (Aim 3). The rationale and translational significance of this project are that identification of alterations in brain development linked to language delay and impairment in the first years of life will allow for more targeted interventions in the auditory domain at a time when they are most effective. Project narrative The project aims to find causes of language impairment in children with autism spectrum disorders by studying the brain organization of the auditory system in toddlers at the very earliest age of provisional diagnosis. The overarching hypothesis is that atypical auditory processing contributes to language delay and impairment.

"Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder affecting more than 1% of children (and almost 2% of boys), with those born in a high risk (HR) family with a child diagnosed with ASD having a ~20 fold greater risk than the general population. Although it can only be reliably diagnosed after the second year of life, ASD originates from a neurodevelopmental mechanism, with symptoms emerging as early as 6 months of age. Prospective large-scale longitudinal neuroimaging studies like the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS), of those born into a high-risk (HR) family, are extremely valuable as they facilitate discovery of the earliest manifestations of ASD. The overarching goal of this proposal is a comprehensive comparative longitudinal analysis of brain organization of high- and low-risk populations, by using IBIS diffusion MRI (dMRI) data collected at 3 time points in the first 2 years of life, to elucidate the earliest manifestations of ASD and disorder trajectory. In addition, we aim to create a biomarker of ASD risk from brain connectivity features and their developmental trajectories, and to understand the brain bases of familial risk (independent of ASD). dMRI provides an insight into the structural organization of the brain represented as a connectome. “Miswiring” of the structural connectome can manifest as neuro-immaturity of WM and changes in network structures, that is, subnetworks (collection of strongly inter-connected regions associated with a distinct communication pattern), and the communication backbone (overall architecture of communication between subnetworks). Both connectivity and WM quality can be compromised in ASD compared to controls, suggesting a “miswired” connectome. Studying ASD related early developmental changes in connectivity requires design of novel analysis methods based on “longitudinal” connectomic features that are 4D features that incorporate their temporal evolution over development, culminating in the creation of novel imaging-based biomarkers. In Aim 1, we will create a new method of extracting longitudinal fiber tracts to identify and analyze differences between the developmental tract trajectories in LR-, HR- and HR+ subjects using geometry and quality features derived from the fiber bundles, to identify differences in neuro-immaturity. In aim 2, we will design novel methods to extract longitudinal network structures like structurally-cohesive and functionally-defined subnetworks and the global communication backbone, and investigate developmental differences modulated by familial risk and gender. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the tract and network features extracted from Aims 1 and 2 to develop imaging based markers that will assist with early ASD prediction, identifying siblings who could gain from an early therapeutic intervention and provide an index of development in the form of brain connectivity “maturational age” to help characterize developmental delays and brain patterns corresponding to the same. The longitudinal analysis methods developed in the proposal will be generalizable to other clinical populations that can gain from longitudinal analysis spanning several time points. Project narrative The project aims at comprehensive comparative analysis of diffusion-based structural connectivity in high- and low-risk populations, to elucidate the earliest manifestation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This will require the design of novel sophisticated longitudinal analysis methods based on longitudinal tracts and network structures that inherently incorporate the temporal evolution over development. Finally, using the developmental trajectories of these features, we aim to create imaging-based biomarkers of familial risk, development and predictive of ASD prior to the age of diagnosis.",Temporal connectomics for infant brain: neurodevelopment modulated by pathology,9848443,R01HD089390,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sex Differences', 'Siblings', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'boys', 'cohesion', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'social communication', 'spatiotemporal', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,571164,0.09911462624387399
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-modal partial least squared analysis to elucidate information linkage between complementary neuroimaging data sets. Research Design: We will analyze both cross-sectional data of young-adult (n=100) vs. middle-aged (n=120) ASD and NT groups, and longitudinal data of middle-aged adults in two year increments (n=120 participants; 360 data sets). Men and women will be similarly represented in groups (M:F ratio, 1.0 : 0.7). Aim 2: Identify the combination of behavioral measures in adults with ASD that best predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-task learning to determine the linkage between complementary behavioral data sets. Research Design: We will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data from Aim 1 ASD participants. Health Relatedness: These aims will have a substantial positive impact on health care quality and costs in the ASD community by vertically advancing our understanding of the unique cognitive and brain aging process, and laying the groundwork for delivering effective, precision medicine care to the growing and vulnerable population of older adults with ASD. Candidate Career Goals: Dr. Braden's long-term goal is to become a leading researcher in the neurobiology of aging in ASD through a multi-disciplinary program from basic science to translational treatment. Her short-term goals are to: 1) comprehensively describe age-related cognitive and brain changes in adults with ASD, and 2) identify targets for behavioral and neurobiological interventions and care plans tailored to specific cognitive needs of older adults with ASD.

"Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment Project Summary  Dr. Muhle is a practicing child psychiatrist with a strong track record of developing molecular and genetic tools to elucidate the mechanism of disease. The long-term goal of this career development award is to identify regulatory networks underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through the integration of state-of-the- art functional genomics, single cell transcriptomics, and systems biology analyses with precision-engineered models of early brain development. She initiated this project during her time in the Adult and Child Psychiatry Research Training Program at the Yale Child Study Center, with the mentorship of James Noonan, Ph.D. and co-mentorship of Matthew State, M.D., Ph.D. With the guidance of Dr. Noonan, a world-wide leader in using functional genomics to understand development and evolution, and the support of Dr. State, an undisputed pioneer and leader in ASD genetics, Dr. Muhle developed expertise in regulatory genomics and the genetic architecture of ASD. Her career goal is to become an independent investigator, examining the role of the ASD risk gene Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding Protein 8 (CHD8) in the development of ASD.  Her research goal is to determine the role of CHD8 and the impact of its loss on regulatory networks. Our hypothesis is that CHD8 regulates ASD risk-associated networks in specific cell-types that become dysregulated when CHD8 expression is altered. To address these questions, she successfully generated a Chd8 constitutive knockout mouse and an Avi-tagged Chd8 mouse that she will use to identify Chd8-regulated networks in specific cell-types at high cellular resolution. She also proposes a high-throughput small molecule screen to explore potential upstream developmental signaling pathways that effect CHD8-regulated expression networks. The following independent specific aims will address our hypothesis: 1) Determine cell-type specific expression changes due to Chd8 haploinsufficiency in the developing cortex. 2) Map Chd8-bound cell-type specific regulatory networks at high resolution in the cortex. 3) Identify bioactive modulators of CHD8 expression networks via high-throughput reporter assay. Our rationale is that by studying CHD8, a key regulatory molecule that targets other ASD risk genes, we will expand our knowledge of other ASD risk genes and identify CHD8-targeted regulatory networks in particular cell-types to further define the biology of ASD.  With the continued mentorship of Dr. Noonan and co-mentorship of Marina Picciotto, M.D., an expert in animal models of neurobehavioral disorders, with collaboration of Thomas Fernandez, M.D., a child psychiatrist with expertise in systems analyses of genetic risk factors, and Smita Krishnaswamy, Ph.D., a computational biologist on the cutting-edge of statistical and mathematical modeling, Dr. Muhle will develop the experimental and analytical skills necessary to fully utilize the model systems she has developed. Together with the resources of the Yale Child Study Center and her career development goals, she will attain her career goal to illuminate basic biological mechanisms underlying brain development and risk for ASD. Project narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent congenital disorder most often characterized by life-long impairments in social communication that create significant obstacles to education, employment and formation of relationships. There is a significant public health need for therapeutics that target the core symptoms of ASD, but despite recent foundational advances in understanding genetic contributors to ASD etiology there is a gap in our understanding of how the diverse etiologies of ASD converge into common pathways on a molecular and cellular level. The studies proposed in this application combine cutting-edge functional genomics and single cell transcriptomics with novel animal and cellular models of early brain development to identify regulatory networks of genes and pathways associated with autism risk at unprecedented cellular resolution, which will provide new-found insight into the biological underpinnings of ASD pathology to inform the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",Mapping Regulatory Networks of Autism Risk at Cellular Resolution during Neurodevelopment,10006848,K08MH115164,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Biotin', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Collaborations', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Cre driver', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Embryo', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligands', 'Ligase', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatrist', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training Programs', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biochip', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'chromatin remodeling', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'fetal', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'helicase', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning network', 'mathematical model', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'social communication', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K08,2020,154085,0.06533221333928234
"Development of a Commercial Platform for Discovery and Validation of Key Microbial Metabolites in CNS Disorders Despite a wealth of continued funding and ever emerging advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, the burden of central nervous system (CNS) disorders remains substantial. The cost of Substance Use Disorder (SUD) alone is estimated at > $181 billion (2002). The findings of numerous efforts tasked with identifying risk factors and causative agents of SUD suggest that vulnerability to dependence is a complex phenotype influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also appears to be largely impacted by both genetic and environmental factors, more specifically the gut microbiome. Recent studies have demonstrated that autism and SUD share common neural networks and molecular signaling pathways. Several of the gene-products associated with the ASD phenotype (e.g., synaptic cell adhesion molecules in the striatum and basal ganglia) affect synaptic transmission between neurons, which has also been implicated in the addiction and reward system. In addition, adults afflicted with high functioning autism exhibit greater susceptibility to drug dependence. We hypothesize that advancing the current state of knowledge regarding ASD, with particular regard to the attributes shared with drug addiction, will inspire the conceptualization and development of novel therapeutic interventions to correct common elements of striatal dysfunction. Testing this hypothesis will require a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package deciphering the phenotypic modulation of the CNS disease. With the funding received through this award, we will design, develop, and commercialize a robust CNS-microbiome-interplay (CMI) platform-based service that will enable (i) elucidation of novel microbiome-mediated targets in CNS diseases, including metabolites, proteins and peptides, (ii) pre-clinical data collection in standardized animal models, quantifying the influence of microbial bioactive molecules, and (iii) application across a wide range of therapeutic areas, such as SUD and ASD. The CMI platform-based service offering will allow medical and pharmaceutical pharma customers (i.e., our target market) to rapidly define diagnostic and therapeutic targets from clinical samples and deduce pre-clinical efficacy estimates sans investment in venture capital or complex infrastructure. The major problem confronting medical and pharmaceutical R&D companies is the difficulty involved with building and maintaining an infrastructure amenable to extensive “omics” enterprises. Second Genome will serve the academic and pharmaceutical R&D community by offering a validated turn-key platform enabling customers the ability to ship clinical fecal samples from affected and unaffected subjects and receive back, as a product: (1) a list of metabolites mediated by microbiome functions and (2) a pre-clinical (in vivo) data package demonstrating phenotypic modulation of Central Nervous System disorders.
