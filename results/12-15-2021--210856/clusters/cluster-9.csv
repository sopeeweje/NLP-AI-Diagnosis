"THERAPY-PLANNING STRATEGIES FOR CONSULTATION BY COMPUTER Therapy planning represents an important area for the development of computer-based clinical consultation systems.  Even when a difficult diagnosis has been made, the optimum treatment may be far from clear.  This is particularly true when adjustments to therapy are required after observing a patient's response to initial interventions.  We propose basic research into the representation and use of therapy-planning strategies of the type routinely employed by expert clinicians as they monitor and adjust the treatment for patients with serious disease entities.  In addition, we propose to implement and test these new techniques in the setting of an existing consultation system known as ONCOCIN.  The ONCOCIN program is an oncology protocol management system that encodes the knowledge of highly structured cancer chemotherapy protocols and gives advice on treatment. Although ONCOCIN is currently in routine experimental use by oncologists in the Stanford oncology clinic, the program is limited in its ability to manage patients who have unexpected responses to therapy.  A generalized approach to therapy planning that can be applied to ONCOCIN will broaden the system's scope and increase its clinical utility.  In summary, this proposal combines basic research in the representation of clinical knowledge with a useful application.  The specific aims of the research are:  (1) to conduct basic research into possible representations of the therapy planning process, particularly how plans are modified in response to unusual conditions prior to or during treatment cycles; (2) to develop a computer program to represent the therapy planning processes of expert clinicians; and (3) to interface the planning program with ONCOCIN.

"STUDIES OF THE DISSEMINATION OF CONSULTATION SYSTEMS We propose to undertake resource-related research into the develo]ment of methodologies that will permit dissemination of high performance clinical consultation and data management systems.  We have developed a prototype system which provides a framework for the execution of clinical trials. Our goal is to extend this model to a broader range of investigators, including those in both academic and community settings.  The initial system, named ONCOCIN, was developed on the SUMEX-AIM Resource at Stanford University and is designed to help oncologists manage patients enrolled in experimental cancer chemotherapy protocols.  In its initial three years, the research has focused on theoretical computer science issues regarding the representation of medical knowledge and the development of optimal methods for encouraging the use of computer-based tools by physicians.  The prototype system has been introduced for limited use in our oncology clinic.  Our goal is to allow systems like ONCOCIN to function independently, on their own hardware, so that they can become useful tools for clinical investigators in a variety of research settings.  We propose a five-year effort with the following specific aims:  (1) to transfer the oncology prototype from its current research computer to a powerful professional workstation that provides a model for the technology that will soon allow large scale cost-effective dissemination of clinical consultation systems; (2) to encode and implement for use by ONCOCIN the commonly used chemotherapy protocols from our oncology clinic; (3) to introduce ONCOCIN gradually for ongoing use so that two professional workstations become available in the oncology clinic to assist in the management of patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials; (4) to implement ONCOCIN beyond the Stanford environment to demonstrate the transferability of the technology and its potential for involving community physicians in clinical investigation; and (5) to develop and test methods for assessing the impact of this kind of tool on physicians, and on their modes of practice.
