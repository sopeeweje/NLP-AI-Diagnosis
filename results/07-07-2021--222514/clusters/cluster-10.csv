"Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to improve the care of patients with laryngeal disorders through development of automated diagnostic support for in-office flexible laryngoscopy. To accomplish this goal, we propose developing neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions in laryngoscopy images. An automated diagnostic tool for in-office laryngoscopy such as we propose will have several benefits: (1) It will improve access to care for patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction living in communities with limited otolaryngology resources, (2) It will improve early detection of laryngeal cancers potentially reducing the morbidity of treatment, and (3) It will prove a valuable teaching tool for students and residents first learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams. Flexible laryngoscopy is a common in-office procedure performed by otolaryngologists to evaluate the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with symptoms of laryngeal dysfunction. Subtle differences in the appearance of laryngeal lesions enable otolaryngologists to differentiate benign lesions from suspected malignant ones. The expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training and therefore laryngoscopy is largely only performed in subspecialty otolaryngology clinics. The primary objective of this project is to develop neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions. Our hypothesis is that these algorithms can be trained using a large dataset of laryngeal images to accurately detect and classify structural laryngeal lesions on flexible laryngoscopic exam. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) Generate a dataset of high-quality, labeled endoscopic laryngeal images corresponding to normal and structural lesions of the larynx, (2) Develop a location-aware anchor-based reasoning neural network for accurate detection of laryngeal lesions, and (3) Develop an adaptive network model for classification of structural laryngeal pathologies including papilloma, polyp, leukoplakia and suspected malignancy. With expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of laryngeal disorders and computer vision, including object detection and classification, our multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to revolutionize in-office laryngoscopy through development of a deep neural network-based automated detection and classification system for diagnosis of structural diseases of the larynx. Currently, flexible laryngoscopy is only performed by expert subspecialists with years of experience because developing the expertise and clinical acumen to correctly interpret laryngoscopic findings requires years of training. Through development of deep neural network-based algorithms to detect and classify laryngeal lesions on in- office laryngoscopy, we will improve access to care for patients living in communities without subspecialty otolaryngology care and will develop an important teaching tool for clinicians learning to interpret laryngoscopic exams.",Automated Detection and Classification of Laryngeal Diseases Using Deep Neural Networks,10043172,R03CA253212,"['Aerodigestive Tract', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Benign', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Goals', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hoarseness', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Laryngeal Diseases', 'Laryngoscopes', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Larynx', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Leukoplakia', 'Location', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of larynx', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Normal Range', 'Otolaryngologist', 'Otolaryngology', 'Papilloma', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plug-in', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vision research', 'Work', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'digital', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neural network', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2020,154375,77014486,0.04889925797968084
"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9970448,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,168019,230060143,0.028830608450025778
"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9976466,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical database', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'feature detection', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,385010,673201228,0.04207145932426607
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules. The goal is to improve lung cancer screening by reducing the number of unnecessary procedure associate the high rate of false positive detections.",Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance,9883874,R01CA237277,"['Administrator', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Colon', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking History', 'Spiculate', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,415606,570146095,0.04356824216725727
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9934164,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effectiveness validation', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,461573,641965656,0.06686097407871983
"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10030978,R01HL153146,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,504903,340417756,0.054733004443001124
"Radiologist-Centered Artificial Intelligence (RCAI) for Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in both men and women in the United States. Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality. However, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign). Artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have helped radiologists to reduce the missed-tumor rates moderately, but have not been widely adopted for three key reasons: lack of efficiency, lack of real-time collaboration, and lack of interpretability. The overall goal of this proposal is to create radiologist-centered artificial intelligence algorithms that are both interpretable and collaborative and to demonstrate their improved efficacy via lung cancer screening experiments. The central hypothesis of this effort is that the creation of an AI based virtual cognitive assistant (VCA) will provide a better understanding of cognitive biases while offering interpretable feedback to radiologists for an improved screening experience with higher diagnostic accuracy, reproducibility, and efficiency.  Specific aims of the proposal are three-fold. Aim 1: To develop an eye-tracking platform that offers a realistic radiology reading room experience while extracting gaze patterns from radiologists. This will facilitate addressing the problem of true collaboration between radiologists and CAD. Radiologists will perform their screening without any constraints (e.g., wearing glasses) while their gaze patterns and other human-computer interaction events are tracked, processed, and stored in real time. Aim 2: To develop an automated real-time collaborative system involving a developed VCA and the radiologist to synergistically improve detection and diagnostic performances. Using deep learning (DL) algorithms, the VCA will embody a powerful visual attention model to represent radiologists’ gaze, visual search, and fixation patterns, and will be composed of a detection component and a diagnostic component. A deep reinforcement learning algorithm will enable communication between the VCA and the radiologist. Lastly, a DL-based segmentation component will, on the fly, enable the VCA to derive and visualize quantitative measures (HU statistics, volume, long/short axes lengths, etc.) and overlay them along with the tumor classification label (benign/malignant) and its probability in real time. Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed VCA via lung cancer screening experiments involving six radiologists from two institutes (University of Pennsylvania and NIH) at different expertise levels.  The proposed VCA is a first-of-a-kind-system to exploit the synergy between powerful DL technology and experts (humans) to attempt boost clinical diagnostic performance of radiologists, unlike passive DL techniques that learn from labeled data. The outcome of this research are expected to be transformative by providing deep insights for re-designing current CAD systems to truly collaborate with radiologists, instead of acting as second opinion tools for them or replacing them, and by ultimately further reducing lung cancer-related deaths. NARRATIVE Although artificial intelligence (AI) based computer aided diagnosis systems have been shown to be useful in lung cancer screening and diagnosis, current radiology practice still suffers from (1) high rates of missed tumors and (2) imprecise lung nodule characterization (malignant vs. benign). The goal of this proposal is to create novel AI algorithms, called radiologist-centered AI, which tightly integrate in real time the radiologist's reading pattern and AI via an eye-tracking device and to demonstrate their improved efficacy via lung cancer screening experiments using low-dose CT scans. The outcome of this research will be a virtual cognitive assistant (VCA) for radiologists, truly actively collaborating with them instead of passively acting as second opinion tools or replacing them, and ultimately further reducing lung cancer-related deaths.",Radiologist-Centered Artificial Intelligence (RCAI) for Lung Cancer Screening and Diagnosis,9971649,R01CA240639,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Location', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung nodule', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Opinions', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual attention', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcification', 'career', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'learning network', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'statistics', 'synergism', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual', 'visual search', 'visual tracking']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R01,2020,576431,16827427,0.046667054639177336
"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. The potential impact is significant given that increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% could positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year in the US alone. Thus, our team is developing an X-ray angiographic analysis system (DeepAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. In Phase I, the PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms was used to build our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning model. We achieved a 0.89 Area Under the Receiving Operating Characteristic (AUROC) for identifying obstructive CAD in images with expert scored ground truth (exceeding our proposed Phase I milestone of >0.85 AUROC). Now in Phase II, we present an innovative image learning pipeline to incorporate anatomical and spatiotemporal information from video sequences (similar to a cardiologist reader). A full end to end X-ray angiography video processing pipeline will be developed and tested in a new cohort of 10,000 patient angiograms with normal and graded abnormal CAD. Our patch-based frame analysis model will advance to CNN full frame-based classification of angiographic views (left heart vs. right heart) and segmentation of coronary vessels (LAD, LCx, and RCA). A multiple frame analysis approach enabled by a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) will equip our model with dynamic temporal information to estimate lesion presence accurately. Our goal for Phase II is to improve reading specificity and translate our Phase I proof of concept research findings into a clinically meaningful tool. A multi-reader, multi-case evaluation by a group of interventional cardiologists interpreting with and without DeepAngio predictions will assess clinical usability to improve coronary stenosis estimation. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with DeepAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation.

"A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysp, dklasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop a based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for identification of regions at risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the esophagus. EAC is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%; yet the standard of care for detecting precursors to EAC is widely recognized to be inadequate. Just recently, a study found that 25% of patients who underwent a standard endoscopic surveillance exam which was found to be ‘clear’ then went on and progressed to EAC within one year. Clearly today’s approach is not working and a significant percentage of disease is being missed. While comprehensive esophageal OCT imaging has shown great potential in addressing this unmet clinical need, one of the main limiters to wider adoption and impact of this technology is the challenge of interpreting the large volume of high-resolution images in real-time. A CAD algorithm would allow OCT to realize its promise in this field and significantly improve the standard of care. Here we propose the development of a deep learning CAD algorithm which will operate on a full patient level volumetric dataset with awareness of the anatomy, robust against image quality and motion artifacts, and trained and validated against a large dataset (>1000 patients). We will aim to go above the performance threshold set by the American Society for Gastroenterology (ASGE) for the performance of advanced imaging in the detection of high grade dysplasia in BE, and include low grade dysplasia while maintaining a Sensitivity and Specificity of 90/80%. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for use with the NinePoint Medical OCT imaging system and provide early detection of pre-cancerous lesions. Earlier detection leads to earlier treatment, more positive health outcomes for patients and lower healthcare system costs.","A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysp, dklasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus",10010407,R44CA232860,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Awareness', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal Diseases', 'Esophageal Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Esophagus', 'Feedback', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'case-based', 'classification algorithm', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnosis quality', 'effective therapy', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'meetings', 'premalignant', 'prospective', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'validation studies']",NCI,"NINEPOINT MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2020,852440,852440,0.10443236426176375

"A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules The early detection of lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) followed by effective treatments, including immunotherapy, can reduce the mortality. LDCT is now recommended for lung cancer screening in smokers. However, more than 25% of smokers screened by LDCT have indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), of which only 4% are finally diagnosed to be lung cancers, whereas more than 95% are benign diseases, resulting in over-diagnosis. As a result, large numbers of smokers with indeterminate PNs are referred for invasive biopsies and expensive 2-year multiple follow-up examinations, which carry their own morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need for accurately distinguishing malignant PN (lung cancer) from benign PN in smokers with LDCT-found PNs. However, none of biomarkers and radiological features of PNs provides sufficient diagnostic values required in the clinics for accurately identifying malignant PNs. The objective of this proposed project is to develop a test for specifically differentiating malignant from benign PN. The target population of this test will be smokers with LDCT-found PNs. Its future use in the clinics will spare smokers with benign PNs from invasive biopsies and expensive multiple follow-up examinations, while facilitating effective treatments to be instantly initiated for lung cancer. Therefore, the test could complement LDCT for the early detection lung cancer, and thereby reduce the mortality and cost. Here we propose to develop an easy and cost-effective test for accurately distinguishing malignant from benign lung nodules. Future use of the test will complement CT screening for the early detection of lung cancer, and ultimately reduce lung cancer-associated deaths.",A diagnostic model for malignant pulmonary nodules,9805358,R21CA240556,"['Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Female', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Marriage', 'Medical', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Pathology', 'Physics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoker', 'Specimen', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'male', 'men', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'never smoker', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'oncology', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'radiomics', 'screening program', 'success', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,201623,230060143,0.028830608450025778
"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions.

"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives.

"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9693200,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,440946,641965656,0.06686097407871983
"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system. Project Narrative: The project aims to develop an online computer tool to aid in efficacious early  lung cancer screening and diagnosis based on LDCT.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism Project Summary/Abstract: The US Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism (PE) a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast, colon, and lung cancers. The current diagnostic standard for suspected PE is CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA). However, the number of CTPA examinations is increasing dramatically, and incorrect CTPA interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis). There is a clinical need to improve the efficiency and accuracy of PE diagnosis at CTPA. Our central hypothesis is that this clinical need can be addressed by exploiting computer-radiologist synergy. However, existing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for PE have serious deficiencies: they are limited in sensitivity and specificity, incapable of handling PE over-diagnosis, and operating only at the embolus level―localizing individual emboli, but PE diagnosis is rendered at the patient-level―excluding non-PE patients and dispatching PE-patients to treatment. Therefore, our objective is to overcome these deficiencies with a new methodology. We have built a strong interdisciplinary team, developed an innovative prototype, and evaluated it through our pilot clinical studies, demonstrating outstanding performance. This proposed research has three specific aims: 1) boost our current system’s embolus-level performance with our newly proposed strategies, assisting radiologists in accurately localizing emboli and facilitating precision medicine through risk stratification; 2) achieve patient-level diagnosis through our newly developed algorithms, assisting radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients and improving diagnostic efficiency; and 3) demonstrate clinical benefits of our system by testing specific clinical hypotheses. This research is innovative because (1) our approach to embolus-level detection fundamentally differs from prior approaches in that it requires no vessel segmentation, overcoming their limitations; (2) we are pioneering two uncharted areas: PE patient-level diagnosis and over-diagnosis prevention; we do not perceive any similar objectives in existing NIH grants or publications in the literature; and (3) this project utilizes our original algorithms and will yield multiple novel algorithms. Our project is significant because it (1) addresses a major national health problem; (2) develops a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention, overcoming the deficiencies of the current PE CAD systems; and (3) delivers a next- generation, high-performance PE CAD system that quickly excludes non-PE patients, accurately localizes emboli, and actively prevent PE over-diagnosis, thereby enhancing radiologists’ diagnostic capabilities and supporting precision medicine through risk stratification. Successful completion of the project is expected because (1) we have already made good progress in algorithm development and clinical evaluation; (2) our approach is carefully crafted on solid algorithmic and mathematical foundations; (3) our clinical evaluation is rigorously designed; and (4) our team is uniquely capable and well prepared to conduct this project, which builds upon our innovative research in CAD, pioneering research in deformable models, and world-renowned PIOPED trials. This research is expected to have important impact on PE- related clinical practice, development of decision support systems for many diseases, and medical education. Project Narrative Behind the great success of biomedical imaging, a crisis is looming: the number of imaging studies is growing exponentially; the workload of radiologists is increasing dramatically; the health-care cost related to imaging is rising rapidly—We are facing a grant new challenge: “image data explosion” (a manifestation of big data in biomedical imaging): Modern imaging systems generate enormous data, far exceeding human abilities for interpretation, but what is paramount are not the images themselves, rather the clinically relevant information contained within the images; therefore, our long-term goal is to develop and validate comprehensive, high-performance computational tools that automatically and quantitatively extract clinically relevant information from images to support clinical decision making and facilitate precision medicine. To demonstrate the immediate, measurable impact of our research, we have chosen pulmonary embolism as our initial research platform because the Surgeon General has declared pulmonary embolism a major national health problem, causing more deaths than breast cancer, AIDS, and motor vehicle accidents combined; with laudable efforts to diagnose pulmonary embolism, the number of CT studies for suspected pulmonary embolism has been increasing dramatically, while incorrect CT interpretations are frequent in general practice (10-14% over/under-diagnosis); therefore, there is a clinical need to (1) mitigate radiologists’ workloads and (2) improve the efficiency and accuracy for pulmonary embolism diagnosis using CT. Our objective is to address this clinical need by exploiting radiologist-computer synergy, delivering two important outcomes: (a) a new methodology that transcends the current paradigm from mere detection of emboli to simultaneous patient-level diagnosis, embolus-level detection, and over-diagnosis prevention; and (b) a next-generation, high- performance system that will be able to assist radiologists in quickly excluding negative patients without overlooking positive patients, accurately localizing individual emboli to support personalized treatments through risk stratification, and actively preventing PE over-diagnosis, exerting an important positive impact on clinical practice associated with pulmonary embolism—a life-threatening condition.",Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism,9741795,R01HL128785,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Embolism', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'General Practices', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk stratification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Impacts', 'Solid', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traffic accidents', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Veins', 'Visualization software', 'Workload', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'synergism', 'vehicular accident']",NHLBI,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R01,2019,586687,51931732,0.0672439180613204
"Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Enhanced x-ray angiography analysis and interpretation using deep learning Over 1 Million diagnostic X-ray angiograms are performed annually in the US to guide treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD) and cost over $12 billion. Despite being the clinical standard of care, visual interpretation is prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently as part of the NHLBI supported Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial, our research team showed that cardiologists misinterpreted over 19% of angiograms obstructive CAD (greater than 50% vessel stenosis). Given the centrality of angiographic interpretation to the development of a treatment plan, reduced accuracy can lead to unnecessary poor outcomes and increased costs to our healthcare system. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) offers a computed measure of disease severity. However, the time and training required to perform QCA has largely relegated its use to research applications. Recent advances in deep learning for medical image analysis offer an opportunity to address this problem. The potential impact is significant given increasing interpretation accuracy by 1% can positively benefit over 10,000 patients each year. Thus, our team proposes to develop an X-ray angiographic analysis system (XAngio) driven by deep learning technology to enhance physician interpretation. We are uniquely positioned to accelerate development of XAngio by leveraging our team’s PROMISE dataset of over 1,000 angiograms with expert QCA scoring. In Phase I, we will teach XAngio how to read angiographic images and how to discriminate obstructive CAD. XAngio will employ a convolutional neural network, a computer vision technique rooted in deep learning, to self-characterize angiographic features from labeled images. In order to infer additional information from vast amounts of unlabeled images, XAngio will incorporate a deconvolutional neural network technique to increase predictive performance. A pilot study of XAngio will test its ability to identify the presence of obstructive CAD in PROMISE angiogram images. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal which is focused on clinical translation of the technology and assessment of its impact on improving visual interpretation in a cohort of cardiologists. Our goal is to combine recent advances in deep learning, big data from PROMISE, and scalable parallel computing to create XAngio. In the long term, we hope the combination of a cardiologist with XAngio as an assistive tool will improve the clinical accuracy of angiographic interpretation.

"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"A Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) Algorithm for Identification of Dysplasia in Patients with Barrett Esophagus ABSTRACT The goal of this project is to develop a based computer aided diagnosis (CAD) algorithm for identification of regions at risk for developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the esophagus. EAC is one of the deadliest cancers with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%; yet the standard of care for detecting precursors to EAC is widely recognized to be inadequate. Just recently, a study found that 25% of patients who underwent a standard endoscopic surveillance exam which was found to be ‘clear’ then went on and progressed to EAC within one year. Clearly today’s approach is not working and a significant percentage of disease is being missed. While comprehensive esophageal OCT imaging has shown great potential in addressing this unmet clinical need, one of the main limiters to wider adoption and impact of this technology is the challenge of interpreting the large volume of high-resolution images in real-time. A CAD algorithm would allow OCT to realize its promise in this field and significantly improve the standard of care. Here we propose the development of a deep learning CAD algorithm which will operate on a full patient level volumetric dataset with awareness of the anatomy, robust against image quality and motion artifacts, and trained and validated against a large dataset (>1000 patients).

"Automated coronary artery calcification scoring for cardiovascular risk screening ABSTRACT The World Health Organization lists cardiovascular disease as the most common cause of death worldwide at 31% of all deaths. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has become the most reliable predictor of future coronary artery disease (CAD) events in the asymptomatic population. CAC scores are currently only reported on ECG-gated CT examinations that are ordered when the primary indication is cardiac in nature. However, in 2007 there were 7.1 million non-cardiac thoracic CT scans ordered with lungs as the primary indication where CAC scores could have been reported. An additional 7-10 million CT lung screening scans are expected to be ordered per year as lung screening programs grow. Because lung cancer risk factors and CAD risk factors overlap significantly, most these patients could benefit greatly from having their CAC score reported as part of their non-cardiac CT examination. This could dramatically improve decision making, quality of care, and lower expenses due to future CAD interventions and cardiac specific CT scans. The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated software application that can report CAC scores on both gated and ungated thoracic CT scans with seamless integration into the Radiology workflow. A successful completion of this project will deliver a product capable of dramatically increasing the number of people that receive early intervention for CAD, thereby increasing quality of care and lowering costs. This Phase I application proposes first creating an algorithm capable of automatically calculating global CAC scores from both ECG-gated and ungated CT scans using CAC segmentations performed by an expert physician. If successful, the Phase II project will perform robust clinical validation adequate for an FDA 510(k) submission.

"Quantitative topographic endoscopy for improved screening of non-polypoid colorectal neoplasms Project Summary This project will create and assess new optical imaging and computational technologies with the goal of improving the detection rates of precancerous, non-polypoid lesions during colonoscopy screening. Identifying and removing these subtle lesions is critical to improving the protective value of colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. However, current approaches to non-polypoid lesion detection are largely unsuccessful because they are time-consuming and require specialized training (chromoendoscopy), or they start with poor image contrast (software analysis of conventional video). This project focuses on developing a novel technique, called quantitative topographic endoscopy (QTE), that optically measures colon surface properties via a modified commercial colonoscope. The key innovation in this proposal is to utilize structured illumination and build on concepts from computer vision and optical engineering to acquire high-resolution 3D images of the colon surface through a custom endoscope. The project will be implemented through three specific aims: (1) develop a miniaturized, quantitative, high-resolution topography system, (2) implement QTE in a modified commercial colonoscope ready for clinical testing, and (3) determine the validity of QTE in a phantom model and its clinical feasibility in a pilot human study. QTE systems developed in this project will be tested in tissue-mimicking phantoms with a goal of achieving better than 1-mm height sensitivity, in ex-vivo resected colon samples with a goal of accurately reconstructing surface shapes from a complex tissue, and in a pilot human study with the goal of obtaining surface topography non-polypoid lesions. Beyond increasing non-polypoid lesion detection rates, QTE has the potential to address other limitations of colonoscopy, including preventing missed polypoid lesions, classifying lesions for resect-and-discard strategies, and improving colonoscopy quality metrics. Additionally, the development of a QTE system that is approved for human studies will serve as a platform for future clinical assessment of other optical techniques such as spatial frequency domain imaging and speckle imaging in a variety of gastroenterology applications. Project Narrative Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Screening colonoscopy can significantly reduce mortality from colorectal cancer but is limited by high miss rates for precancerous non- polypoid lesions.

"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives. The first step towards this goal is a correct diagnosis of melanoma.",Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study,9523267,R01CA200690,"['Adult', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Caring', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatopathology', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Mitotic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Precancerous melanosis', 'Process', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'maltreatment', 'melanocyte', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'skin lesion', 'stem', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,385011,673201228,0.04207145932426607
"Spectral precision imaging for early diagnosis of colorectal lesions with CT colonography Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, even though it could be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, the current standard of cathartic bowel preparation for CTC and optical colonoscopy (OC) is poorly tolerated by patients and has been recognized as a major barrier to colorectal examinations. Our advanced non-cathartic multi-center computer-assisted CTC trial showed that non-cathartic CTC is easily tolerated by patients and that radiologists who use computer-aided detection (CADe) can detect large polyps in size in non-cathartic CTC with high sensitivity, comparable to that of OC. However, SF6-lesions (serrated lesions, flat lesions <3 mm in height, and polyps 6 – 9 mm in size) were a significant source of false negatives in the trial. The challenges of detection and visualization of these SF6-lesions in non-cathartic CTC are caused largely by the inability of the current single-energy CTC technique to differentiate between soft tissues, fecal tagging, and their partial volumes with lumen air. We propose to employ multi-spectral CTC precision imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) to overcome these inherent limitations of non-cathartic CTC. Our goal in this project is to develop a novel deep-learning AI (DEEP-AI) scheme for multi-spectral multi-material (MUSMA) precision imaging, which will use deep super-learning of high-quality spectral CTC (spCTC) precision images to boost the diagnostic performance of non-cathartic CTC. We hypothesize that (1) high-quality MUSMA precision images can be reconstructed from ultra-low-dose (<1 mSv) spCTC scans, (2) DEEP-AI will yield a detection sensitivity for ≥6 mm SF6-lesions comparable to that of OC, and that (3) the use of DEEP-AI as first reader will significantly improve radiologists’ detection performance for SF6-lesions and reduce interpretation time compared with unaided reading, and that it will yield a detection accuracy comparable to that of OC. Our specific aims are (1) to establish a non-cathartic spCTC and MUSMA precision image database, (2) to develop a DEEP-AI Interpretation System for visualization and detection of SF6-lesions, and (3) to evaluate the clinical benefit of the DEEP-AI Interpretation System with non-cathartic spCTC cases. Successful development of the proposed DEEP-AI Interpretation System will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of SF6-lesions from non-cathartic CTC examinations that address the problem of patient adherence to colorectal screening guidelines. Such a scheme will make non-cathartic CTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, leading to an increased colorectal screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules. It will not only provide a useful imaging biomarker to assist in lung nodule management for individuals, but also constitute a strong foundation to meet our long-term goal of developing clinically- translatable decision support system (DSS) to facilitate personalized medicine in early detection of lung cancer, optimizing treatment strategies and reducing health care costs",Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer,9526145,U01CA216459,"['Advocate', 'Anxiety', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institutes', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lobectomy', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Screening Result', 'Solid', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically translatable', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'screening program', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,480528,641965656,0.06686097407871983
"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules Low dose CT screening (LDCT) has been approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) for Medicare coverage. However, the primary problem associated with CT is the high false positive  detections (~96%). This issue often leads to unpleasant and costly unintended consequences (e.g.,  follow-up scans and/or invasive biopsies). In this project, we propose to develop and commercialize  a novel computer tool to aid in accurate assessment of indeterminate lung nodules. The goal is to  accurately and efficiently quantify the potential risk of developing lung cancer and its future  prognosis, thereby facilitating precise / personalized lung cancer screening and optimal patient  management. During Phase I of this project, we have accomplished the proposed milestones and  developed a prototype system that is now publicly accessible. Our preliminary validation of the  prototype system demonstrates very promising performance. In Phase II, we will continue our effort  to make this tool available to serve clinical community with the following specific aims: (1)  develop a generalized framework that supports the incorporation of both image and patient  information as well as other biological tests related to lung cancer; (2) fully optimize the  computer algorithms to efficiently analyze chest CT scans and in particular synergize our  algorithms with the deep learning technology to improve training efficiency and benign/malignance  classification accuracy; and (3) comprehensively validate and optimize the system in clinical  environment at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We believe that the proposed  system is extremely timely and important in light of the CMS decision to cover annual LDCT lung  cancer screening. Its availability will significantly reduce the over-diagnosis associated with  LDCT for lung cancer screening and relieve the economic burden on healthcare system. Project Narrative: The project aims to develop an online computer tool to aid in efficacious early  lung cancer screening and diagnosis based on LDCT.

"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,9536759,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'microscopic imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'reflectance confocal microscopy', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2018,619539,185946435,0.02323811308720419
"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives.

"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.

"Deep-radiomics-learning for mass detection in CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States. However, it would be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. The use of CT colonography (CTC) would substantially increase the access, capacity, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. The interpretation of CTC examinations would be most effective by use of a first-reader computer- aided detection (FR-CADe) paradigm, where a radiologist reviews only the lesion candidates detected automatically by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. However, because CADe systems can miss large masses, radiologists still need to perform an additional two-dimensional (2D) review of the CT images of the colon, which increases reading time over 40% on average. Furthermore, also radiologists can occasionally miss some types of masses on CTC images. The goal of this project is to develop a DEep RAdiomics LEarning (DERALE) scheme for the detection of large masses on CTC images. The scheme will be used to integrate deep learning methods and radiomic biomarkers to perform a complete automated review of CTC images for reliable detection of colorectal masses. We hypothesize that the DERALE scheme will be able to detect colorectal masses at a sensitivity comparable to that of unaided expert radiologists and that it can be used to reduce the interpretation time of FR- CADe without degrading diagnostic accuracy in CTC. We will evaluate and compare the classification performance of DERALE with that of unaided expert radiologists and conduct an observer performance study to compare the detection accuracy of the use of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm with that of unaided expert radiologists in the detection of masses from CTC images. Successful development and broad adoption of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm will facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce the mortality rate from colon cancer, one of the largest threats of cancer deaths in the United States. Project Narrative Successful development and validation of DERALE will substantially advance the clinical implementation of CTC and the FR-CADe paradigm in large populations to facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce mortality from colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States.

"Deep radiomic colon cleansing for laxative-free CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, can be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC), also known as virtual colonoscopy, could substantially increase the capacity, safety, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. However, an FDA panel has recently identified two remaining concerns about CTC: patient adherence, and the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. Our clinical multi-center trial showed that laxative-free preparation by oral ingestion of a contrast agent (iodine) to indicate fecal materials for electronic cleansing (EC), followed by computer-aided detection (CADe), makes CTC easy to tolerate for patients while enabling the detection of ≥10 mm lesions at sensitivity comparable to that of optical colonoscopy. However, small polyps and flat lesions were a significant source of false negatives, because EC produced image artifacts that imitated such lesions. Because laxative-free CTC addresses the concern of patient adherence, the only remaining concern about CTC is the detection of small polyps and flat lesions. The goal of this project is to develop a novel multi-material deep-learning scheme, hereafter denoted as Deep- ECAD, that integrates EC and CADe for the detection of small polyps and flat lesions in laxative-free spectral CTC (spCTC), where spectral imaging and deep learning will be used to overcome the above limitations of conventional CTC. Our specific aims are to (1) establish a laxative-free ultra-low-dose spCTC image database, (2) develop a multi-material deep-learning method for EC, (3) develop deep radiomic detection of small polyps and flat lesions, and (4) evaluate the clinical benefit of Deep-ECAD with laxative-free cases. Successful development of the proposed Deep-ECAD scheme will substantially improve human readers’ performance in the detection of small polyps and flat lesions while minimizing the inconveniences of bowel preparation and radiation risk to patients. Such a scheme will make laxative-free spCTC a highly accurate and acceptable screening option for large populations, in particular, Medicare population, leading to an increased screening rate, promoting early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reducing mortality due to colon cancer.

"Crowdsourcing-aided machine learning for colon cancer prevention ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CADe) has become a standard tool in diagnostic radiology. Because CADe systems are highly sensitive, they can help radiologists detect abnormalities in medical images. However, CADe systems also detect large numbers of false positives that distract radiologists and reduce their confidence in the CADe technology. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, but it would be preventable by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has been endorsed as a viable option for colorectal screening under the guidelines of the American Cancer Society, U.S. Multi-Society Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. However, the interpretation of CTC images requires skill and it is time-consuming. The first-reader CADe paradigm, where a radiologist interprets a CTC study by reviewing an image gallery of potential abnormalities detected by CADe at high sensitivity, has recently been shown to provide an accurate workflow for the detection of colorectal lesions. Although most of the false-positive (FP) CADe detections are easy to dismiss even for inexperienced human readers, for a radiologist a review of a large number of CADe detections is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. If, however, we could use crowdsourcing to distribute the images of high-sensitivity CADe detections to knowledge workers (KWs) who have been trained to dismiss FP CADe detections, we could implement an advanced high-performance CTC interpretation system that yields both high detection sensitivity and specificity. Crowdsourcing with big data can also be used to improve the performance of machine learning that is largely the reason for the low specificity of current CADe systems. The incorporation of big data in the form of large and representative online training databases to improve the classification performance of machine learning can be implemented by identifying relevant new training cases by detecting disagreements between crowdsourcing-based interpretations and computer- estimated lesion likelihoods. The goal of this project is to develop a Crowdsourcing-Aided MachinE Learning (CAMEL) scheme that will integrate machine learning with crowdsourcing for the detection of colorectal lesions in CTC. Although we will use colon CADe as an example system, the proposed concept applies to other CADe applications as well. We hypothesize that the CAMEL scheme will achieve a classification accuracy that is higher than that of machine learning alone and equivalent to that of unaided expert radiologists, and that it can improve radiologists' performance in the detection of clinically significant lesion in CTC. To achieve the goal and to test the study hypothesis, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a decision support (DES) system which allows human participation; (2) Develop a CAMEL scheme for polyp detection with crowdsourcing; (3) Evaluate the clinical benefit of CAMEL. Successful development of CAMEL will demonstrate the clinical benefit of an engaging crowdsourcing platform for accurate colon cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of Crowdsourcing-Aided MachinE Learning (CAMEL) will demonstrate the clinical benefit of a crowdsourcing platform for accurate colon cancer screening. Because computer-aided detection (CADe) systems excel at detecting lesions (high sensitivity), whereas humans excel at removing false-positive CADe detections (high specificity), a crowdsourcing-assisted machine learning scheme should outperform individual human readers and CADe systems. In long term, broad adoption and use of the CAMEL scheme will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus will reduce mortality from colon cancer that is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.",Crowdsourcing-aided machine learning for colon cancer prevention,9269542,UH2CA203730,"['Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'American College of Radiology', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Reader', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'clinically significant', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'virtual']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UH2,2017,341979,551214295,0.06676558261382179
"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States. Project Narrative Successful development of the proposed deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about computer-aided detection (CADe) by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Such a system is expected to outperform current state-of-the-art CADe systems in the diagnosis of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.",Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer,9288493,R01EB023942,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reader', 'Retrieval', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'computer aided detection', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'success']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,436007,551214295,-0.0034518380569961917
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians.

"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality.

"Deep-radiomics-learning for mass detection in CT colonography Project Summary/Abstract Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States. However, it would be prevented by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. The use of CT colonography (CTC) would substantially increase the access, capacity, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient compliance of colorectal examinations. The interpretation of CTC examinations would be most effective by use of a first-reader computer- aided detection (FR-CADe) paradigm, where a radiologist reviews only the lesion candidates detected automatically by a computer-aided detection (CADe) system. However, because CADe systems can miss large masses, radiologists still need to perform an additional two-dimensional (2D) review of the CT images of the colon, which increases reading time over 40% on average. Furthermore, also radiologists can occasionally miss some types of masses on CTC images. The goal of this project is to develop a DEep RAdiomics LEarning (DERALE) scheme for the detection of large masses on CTC images. The scheme will be used to integrate deep learning methods and radiomic biomarkers to perform a complete automated review of CTC images for reliable detection of colorectal masses. We hypothesize that the DERALE scheme will be able to detect colorectal masses at a sensitivity comparable to that of unaided expert radiologists and that it can be used to reduce the interpretation time of FR- CADe without degrading diagnostic accuracy in CTC. We will evaluate and compare the classification performance of DERALE with that of unaided expert radiologists and conduct an observer performance study to compare the detection accuracy of the use of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm with that of unaided expert radiologists in the detection of masses from CTC images. Successful development and broad adoption of DERALE in the FR-CADe paradigm will facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce the mortality rate from colon cancer, one of the largest threats of cancer deaths in the United States. Project Narrative Successful development and validation of DERALE will substantially advance the clinical implementation of CTC and the FR-CADe paradigm in large populations to facilitate early, accurate, and cost-effective diagnoses, and thus it will reduce mortality from colon cancer, the second leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women in the United States. The research is innovative in that robust mass detection has not been developed for CTC and FR- CADe, and that there have been no attempts to use deep learning for mass detection in CTC.",Deep-radiomics-learning for mass detection in CT colonography,9167836,R21EB022747,"['Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'American College of Radiology', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heating', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Societies', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer aided detection', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'two-dimensional']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2016,256500,551214295,0.07185936711140631
"Crowdsourcing-aided machine learning for colon cancer prevention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CADe) has become a standard tool in diagnostic radiology. Because CADe systems are highly sensitive, they can help radiologists detect abnormalities in medical images. However, CADe systems also detect large numbers of false positives that distract radiologists and reduce their confidence in the CADe technology. Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women in the United States, but it would be preventable by early detection and removal of its precursor lesions. Computed tomographic colonography (CTC) has been endorsed as a viable option for colorectal screening under the guidelines of the American Cancer Society, U.S. Multi-Society Task Force, and the American College of Radiology. However, the interpretation of CTC images requires skill and it is time-consuming. The first-reader CADe paradigm, where a radiologist interprets a CTC study by reviewing an image gallery of potential abnormalities detected by CADe at high sensitivity, has recently been shown to provide an accurate workflow for the detection of colorectal lesions. Although most of the false-positive (FP) CADe detections are easy to dismiss even for inexperienced human readers, for a radiologist a review of a large number of CADe detections is tedious, time-consuming, and expensive. If, however, we could use crowdsourcing to distribute the images of high-sensitivity CADe detections to knowledge workers (KWs) who have been trained to dismiss FP CADe detections, we could implement an advanced high-performance CTC interpretation system that yields both high detection sensitivity and specificity. Crowdsourcing with big data can also be used to improve the performance of machine learning that is largely the reason for the low specificity of current CADe systems. The incorporation of big data in the form of large and representative online training databases to improve the classification performance of machine learning can be implemented by identifying relevant new training cases by detecting disagreements between crowdsourcing-based interpretations and computer- estimated lesion likelihoods. The goal of this project is to develop a Crowdsourcing-Aided MachinE Learning (CAMEL) scheme that will integrate machine learning with crowdsourcing for the detection of colorectal lesions in CTC. Although we will use colon CADe as an example system, the proposed concept applies to other CADe applications as well. We hypothesize that the CAMEL scheme will achieve a classification accuracy that is higher than that of machine learning alone and equivalent to that of unaided expert radiologists, and that it can improve radiologists' performance in the detection of clinically significant lesion in CTC. To achieve the goal and to test the study hypothesis, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a decision support (DES) system which allows human participation; (2) Develop a CAMEL scheme for polyp detection with crowdsourcing; (3) Evaluate the clinical benefit of CAMEL. Successful development of CAMEL will demonstrate the clinical benefit of an engaging crowdsourcing platform for accurate colon cancer screening. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of Crowdsourcing-Aided MachinE Learning (CAMEL) will demonstrate the clinical benefit of a crowdsourcing platform for accurate colon cancer screening. Because computer-aided detection (CADe) systems excel at detecting lesions (high sensitivity), whereas humans excel at removing false-positive CADe detections (high specificity), a crowdsourcing-assisted machine learning scheme should outperform individual human readers and CADe systems. In long term, broad adoption and use of the CAMEL scheme will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus will reduce mortality from colon cancer that is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States.",Crowdsourcing-aided machine learning for colon cancer prevention,9077924,UH2CA203730,"['Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'American College of Radiology', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Reader', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'clinically significant', 'computer aided detection', 'crowdsourcing', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'virtual']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,UH2,2016,341897,551214295,0.06676558261382179
"Improving Melanoma Pathology Accuracy through Computer Vision Techniques - the IMPACT Study ABSTRACT  This proposal will help to improve the accuracy of diagnosing melanoma and melanocytic lesions. The incidence of melanoma is rising faster than any other cancer, and ~1 in 50 U.S. adults will be diagnosed with melanoma this year alone. Our research team has noted substantial diagnostic errors in interpreting skin biopsies of melanocytic lesions; pathologists disagree in up to 60% of cases of invasive melanoma, which can lead to substantial patient harm. Our proposal uses computer technology to analyze whole-slide digital images of glass slides in order to improve the diagnosis of melanocytic lesions. Using data from an ongoing NIH study, we will digitize and study a set of 240 skin biopsy cases that includes a full spectrum of benign to invasive melanoma diagnoses. Each biopsy case has a reference consensus diagnosis developed by a panel of three international experts in dermatopathology and new data will be available from 160 practicing U.S. community pathologists, providing a uniquely rich clinical database that is the largest of its kind. This project will include novel computational techniques, including the detection of both cellular-level and architectural entities, and the use of a combination of feature-based and deep neural network classifiers. Our specific aims are: 1. To detect cellular-level entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 2. To detect structural (architectural) entities in digitized whole slide images of melanocytic skin lesions. 3. To develop an automated diagnosis system that can classify digitized slide images into one of five possible diagnostic classes: benign; atypical lesions; melanoma in situ; invasive melanoma stage T1a; and invasive melanoma stage ≥T1b. In our proposed study, we are innovatively using computer image analysis algorithms and machine learning. This technology has the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of pathologists by providing an analytical, undeviating review to assist humans in this difficult task. Project Narrative Diagnosis of melanoma and melanocytic skin biopsy lesions is among the most challenging areas of pathology and our preliminary data shows concerning levels of errors among pathologists. Our ultimate goal is to use innovative computer image analysis and machine learning techniques to reduce diagnostic errors and save patients' lives.

"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only. By identifying abnormalities otherwise missed, the ensuing surgical removal of an abnormality can often stop seizures.",Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias,9061843,R44NS083101,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Cortical Malformation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Dysplasia', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Excision', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Slice', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain malformation', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'migration', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vector', 'visual search', 'white matter']",NINDS,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R44,2016,750677,733415,0.036099533916430344
"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT).

"A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primarily due to the lack of physical symptoms in the early stage, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and worldwide. Although high-resolution computed tomography (CT) has been proved to be a sensitive, non-invasive modality for visualizing small lung nodules, which could be the early manifestation of lung cancer, a considerable number of false positive detections are often resulted. Consequently, additional procedures, such as invasive biopsy / follow-up scans, are frequently needed to verify the nature of the indeterminate nodules. The negative effects associated with these over-diagnosis procedures, such as biopsy complications, exposure to additional radiation, patient anxiety, and economic cost, significantly limits the efficacy of CT screening for early diagnosis of lung cancer. In this project, we propose to develop a computer model to quantitatively assess the nature of indeterminate nodules using a longitudinal dataset. Unlike available investigations or lung cancer risk models, we will comprehensively quantify a wide variety of properties (features) of a nodule in an unprecedented detailed manner as well as their variations over time, and synergize them with patient demographic information (e.g., age, gender, smoke history) using machine learning techniques. Not only the image features of lung nodules but also their spatial relationship with respect to important lung landmarks as well as other smoke related lung abnormalities (e.g., emphysema) will be incorporated into this model. The output of this project, namely a novel computer tool, could aid clinicians to more accurately and efficiently assess the nature of indeterminate nodules, ultimately leading to the reduction of unnecessary harm and costs to patients and the healthcare system. All these will significantly improve the efficacy of CT for early lung cancer screening by maintaining its high sensitivity while reducing false positive findings. In terms of commercial potential, the developed tool could be easily integrated with the available image information systems at medical institutions by following the widely adopted Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to develop a novel computer tool for aiding in accurate assessment of indeterminate nodules. Its novelty lies in the incorporation of a large variety of image features and patient demographic information using machine learning techniques and a longitudinal dataset. The availability of this tool would significantly improve th efficacy of CT by reducing false positive findings while maintaining its high sensitivity.            ",A Computer Tool for Aiding in Accurate Assessment of Indeterminate Lung Nodules,9043798,R43CA203058,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonology', 'Radiation', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoke', 'Smoking History', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway remodeling', 'angiogenesis', 'calcification', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'economic cost', 'follow-up', 'image guided', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NCI,INTERNATIONAL INTELLIGENT INFOR/SOLU/LAB,R43,2015,149970,0,0.05753528986453028
"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact.

To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images.

These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform.

A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project. If we are successful in achieving our aims, we will have a practical solution to the MC detection problems in DBT. We will produce an MC-enhanced and CAD-assisted reading protocol that will serve as a model for DBT system and workstation design. This will pave the way for the acceptance of DBT for clinical use, thereby improving the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening which will benefit all women.",Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis,8901759,R01CA151443,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Breast Tomosynthesis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'human subject', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2015,550270,641965656,0.10720780043508593
"Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Melanoma is diagnosed in approximately 124,000 people and is responsible for about 10,000 deaths every year, in the USA. Dermatologists rely on visual and dermatoscopic examination to discriminate benign melanocytic lesions from malignant, resulting in high and highly variable benign-to-malignant biopsy ratios from 8:1 to 47:1, and millions of unnecessary biopsies of benign lesions. Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) imaging has been proven for noninvasively guiding diagnosis of melanoma in several large clinical studies. RCM imaging at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ) provides sensitivity of 92-88% and specificity of 71-84%. The specificity is 2 times superior to that of dermatoscopy. RCM imaging at the DEJ is now being implemented to rule out malignancy, reduce biopsy and guide treatment. However, this is currently at only a few sites, where there are highly trained experts who can ensure that imaging is appropriately performed and images are read correctly. These experts are a small international cohort of ""early adopter"" clinicians, who have worked with RCM technology during the past decade and have become highly skilled readers. For novice (non-expert) clinicians in the wider cohort who are keen to adopt RCM, learning to read images is challenging and requires substantial effort and time. Two major technical barriers underlie the dramatic variability in diagnostic accuracy among novice clinicians. Together they limit utility, reproducibility and wider adoption of RCM. The first is user dependent subjective variability in depths near the DEJ at which images are acquired, and the second is variability in interpretation of images. We propose to address these barriers with computational ""multi-faceted"" classification modeling (innovation), image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Our specific aims are: (1) to develop and evaluate algorithms for both dermatoscopic images and RCM depth-stacks, to enable automated standardized and consistent acquisition of RCM mosaics at the DEJ in melanocytic lesions; (2) to develop and evaluate algorithms to discriminate patterns of cellular morphology at the DEJ into two classes, benign lesions versus malignant (dysplastic lesions and melanoma); and (3) to test our algorithms on patients for acquisition of RCM mosaics and classification into those two groups, with statistical validation against pathology, with statistical validation against pathology. Preliminary studies show that our algorithms can delineate the DEJ with accuracy in the range ~3-13 μm in strongly pigmented dark skin and ~5-20 μm in lightly pigmented fair skin, and can detect cellular morphologic patterns with sensitivity in the range 67-80% and specificity 78-99%. Melanocytic lesions can be distinguished from the surrounding normal skin at the DEJ with 80% classification accuracy. We are a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Northeastern University and University of Modena. Our success will produce standardized imaging and analysis approaches, to advance RCM for noninvasive detection of melanoma. Furthermore, these approaches can be useful for non-melanoma skin cancers, cutaneous lymphoma and other skin disorders (wider impact).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) is an optical imaging technology that can guide biopsy and enable noninvasive screening and diagnosis of skin cancers. However, visual reading and interpretation of RCM images requires substantial training for clinicians. We propose to develop computer-based algorithms to assist clinicians in reading images, serve as tools for training, and accelerate wider adoption of RCM technology by dermatologists.            ",Automated Image Guidance for Diagnosing Skin Cancer With Confocal Microscopy,8946754,R01CA199673,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Cutaneous Lymphoma', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermatologist', 'Dermoscopy', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Glass', 'Hypersensitivity skin testing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Italy', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pigments', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specificity', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'melanoma', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'optical imaging', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'skin disorder', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2015,658985,185946435,0.02323811308720419
"Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to build computer-aided detection (CAD) software for use in identifying cortical malformations known as focal cortical dysplasia's (FCDs), which are a common cause of epileptic seizures. The intent is for the software, used by a neuroradiologist at a clinical workstation, to decrease the time- intensive nature of the visual search for cortical dysplasia's, while simultaneously increasing sensitivity o dysplasia identification, thus reducing the number of missed lesions and making neuroradiologists more effective and more efficient.  Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder, characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, that exacts a large toll upon society in terms of both quality of life and health care costs. Malformations of cortical development (MCD) are the most common cause of seizures in children and the second most common cause in adults. Focal cortical dysplasia is a common form of MCD that is responsible for the vast majority of treatment resistant epilepsy in patients with MCD, and when anti-epileptic medication is ineffective, detection of FCD becomes critical to the ability of the epilepsy team to offer surgery which is often these patient's last hope for seizure freedom.  Unfortunately, the radiological diagnosis of FCD is exceedingly difficult in a large percentage of cases due to their focal and subtle nature. Thus, while resection of these dysplasias can often cure seizures, they can be missed for years or decades, resulting in increased neurological damage and degradation of quality of life due to chronic seizures. In principle high resolution MRI can be used to increase diagnostic accuracy. While this is becoming more common in clinical practice, the need for high patient throughput, lack of clinical information and inexperience often results i these lesions being missed on routine clinical reads by neuroradiologists.  The project will build upon a foundation of existing technology for the generation of quantitative measures of the human brain based on MRI imaging, known in the neuroimaging research domain as FreeSurfer. The project will make use of an MRI dataset of 100 subjects with histologically-confirmed FCD to be labeled by four neuroradiologists, and control subjects with epilepsy that is not due to FCD. The project has three aims: gathering the dataset and expansion of the detection algorithms tested in Phase I to include additional MRI biomarkers; development of an MRI scanner slice prescription component to ensure imaging of an FCD at the optimal visualization plane; and an aim to submit a commercialized version of FreeSurfer for FDA 510(k) clearance. The latter aim is important for the long-term project goal of advancing the state of other clinical detection methods through the building of additional CAD tools making use of FreeSurfer's brain measures, including diseases as varied as Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, tumor monitoring and hydrocephalus.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal is to build software for computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs), a malformation of brain development that is a common cause of epileptic seizures in children and adults. The proposed software will offer a neuroradiologist a faster and more accurate detection method compared to visual inspection only. By identifying abnormalities otherwise missed, the ensuing surgical removal of an abnormality can often stop seizures.            ",Computer-aided detection of focal cortical dysplasias,8903251,R44NS083101,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Cortical Malformation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Drug Formulations', 'Dysplasia', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Seizures', 'Slice', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Vendor', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'brain malformation', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'migration', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vector', 'visual search', 'white matter']",NINDS,"CORTICOMETRICS, LLC",R44,2015,750677,733415,0.036099533916430344
"Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and in the US. While the genetics of this disease are intrinsically complex, thanks to huge research investments during the last 5-10 years, particularly in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a more unbiased, data-driven and realistic view of CAD has been achieved. As part of this achievement, ~160 common risk loci for CAD/myocardial infarction (MI) have been identified. An important task is now to understand the molecular mechanisms/pathways by which these loci exert risk for CAD/MI allowing to translating the initial findings into new therapies and diagnostics. However, since the loci identified thus far explain only ~10% of variation in CAD/MI risk, it is also essential to define additional CAD pathways operating in parallel with GWA loci. In recent years, clinical studies that consider intermediate phenotypes (between DNA and disease) have greatly enhanced interpretations of risk loci identified in GWA datasets. In addition, disease networks that can be identified from intermediate molecular phenotypes provide an essential framework to identify novel CAD pathways and targets for new CAD therapies. Over the last 6 years, we have performed a clinical study considering many intermediate phenotypes in CAD patients (the STARNET study). In this proposal we intend to use newly generated DNA genotype and RNA sequence data from the STARNET study to identify atherosclerosis and metabolic networks underlying CAD. We then propose a new prospective study of CAD (the NGS-PREDICT study) with the main purpose of validating findings from the STARNET study. We hypothesize that the extent and stability of coronary lesions, thus clinical outcomes can be accurately assessed by defining the status of key atherosclerosis gene networks. In turn, metabolic networks active in liver, abdominal fat, and skeletal muscle influence the status of the atherosclerosis gene networks. In addition, molecular data isolated from easily obtainable tissues (e.g., blood, subcutaneous fat and plasma) can be used to identify biomarkers that can predict risk for clinical events caused by CAD. To test these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: To identify regulatory Bayesian gene networks causally linked to CAD and/or CAD sub-phenotypes using the STARNET datasets and the CARDIoGRAM meta-analysis GWA datasets. Aim 2: Identify biomarkers predicting clinical events of CAD (reflected in SYNTAX score) by applying machine learning on DNA genotype, RNA sequence and CAD plasma protein data from easily obtainable tissues of the STARNET cases. Aim 3: To validate the identified causal CAD eQTLs/networks and the biomarkers using the NGS-PREDICT study performed at the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the Swedish Twin study and CAD cell and animal models. We believe the proposed studies can lead to a significantly better molecular understanding of CAD and thus, serve the more long-term goal of preventive and personalized therapies of CAD patients diagnosed in well-defined molecular subcategories.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the world's leading cause of death. We will perform systems genetic analysis of DNA and RNAseq data from 9 CAD-relevant tissues in 700 well-characterized patients (STARNET) integrated with genome-wide association data to reveal CAD-causing metabolic and atherosclerosis gene networks, and within these, new inherited risk variants, CAD-mechanisms, therapeutic targets and biomarkers will be identified and validated in a new prospective clinical study of CAD (NGS-PREDICT). Our studies promise to significantly advance understanding of CAD towards achieving preventive and personalized care.                ",Toward Diagnostics and Therapies of Molecular Subcategories of CAD,8964154,R01HL125863,"['Abdomen', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Angiography', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease model', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foam Cells', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'New York', 'Opening of the Thorax', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Preventive', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Reading', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Subcategory', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Whole Blood', 'abdominal fat', 'biological systems', 'clinical risk', 'computer based statistical methods', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genetic analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'in vivo Model', 'macrophage', 'medical schools', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'personalized care', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'risk variant', 'subcutaneous', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,828928,415711940,0.12847563474017099
"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                ",Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes,8580179,F32EY022558,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Early Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'EP300 gene', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Nodule', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Screening for cancer', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stretching', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer therapy', 'clinically relevant', 'directed attention', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lung cancer screening', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'screening', 'tool', 'vision science', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,F32,2014,36508,327644200,0.04144176281731591
"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.          Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate. Such a system will promote the early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reduce the mortality due to colon cancer.

"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8586273,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2014,610289,641965656,0.05299714978039279
"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.

"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.          Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate. Such a system will promote the early diagnosis of colon cancer, and ultimately reduce the mortality due to colon cancer.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project.

"Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Cancer screening saves lives (e.g. National Lung Screening Trial Research, 2011). Every day, radiologists are faced with difficult, time-consuming visual search tasks like in mammography and lung cancer screening. Oftentimes signs of cancer, e.g. lung nodules or little abnormalities in a breast, are very hard to find against heterogeneous backgrounds and obscured by overlapping tissues. Missing these signs of cancer can result in wrong diagnoses with life or death consequences. It is therefore of key interest to identify and tackle the problems posed in these crucial search tasks. The proposed studies aim to improve search performance in cancer screening in two ways: First, by enhancing the visibility of lung nodules embedded in 3D volumetric datasets. Radiologists usually search for lung nodules by scrolling through stacks of chest CT. Nodules are roughly spherical features, spanning a few slices in a CT stack. Anecdotally, experts report that the way that lung nodules 'pop' in and out of the changing view is a signal to their presence. We propose an innovative approach using saliency algorithms that harness this signal to enhance chest CTs in a way that directs attention to crucial regions of a scene. Second, we aim to improve search performance by understanding and utilizing non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of mammograms. Recent work has shown that expert radiologists can detect a global signal in mammograms that allows for above-chance categorization of normal and abnormal breasts after very short exposures to the stimulus. We will first train novices to become experts in closer approximation to the medical tasks. As expertise develops, we will investigate two different neural correlates that might evolve in the course of training using electroencephalography (EEG), namely the P300 and the N2pc. In other settings, these measures can signal attentional selection either across (P300) or within (N2pc) briefly presented images. We will adapt a new method that exploits machine learning for real-time decoding of brain signals. It allows neural signatures, elicited in response to a sequence of images, to be used to rank those images in order of their implicit 'interest' to the viewer. We hypothesize that this information can be fed back to the observer/radiologist as a source of information that might, for example, suggest that an image or region deserves more scrutiny. The main goals of this proposal are therefore to understand the guidance of attention in complex visual search tasks and to apply this knowledge to improvements in clinically relevant search tasks like cancer screening.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high. We propose two ways of aiding cancer screening by radiologists: 1) We will enhance search displays by using saliency algorithms to direct attention to crucial regions of a scene. 2) We will utilize neural signals elicited by non-selective, 'gist'-like processing of medical images as a novel support for evaluation of mammograms.                  Understanding and enhancing visual search performance in complex scenes Early detection of cancer can save lives, but error rates in cancer screening, both misses and false alarms, are still too high.

In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.           7.

"A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval  Project Summary The predominant approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging has been to use automated image analysis to serve as a ""second reader,"" with the aim of improving radiologists' diagnostic performance. CAD techniques traditionally aim to highlight suspicious lesions (called CADe) and/or estimate diagnostic variables, such as probability of malignancy (called CADx).  We have been developing and evaluating a different approach to CAD, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will automatically identify and display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated (referred to as the query). This will involve searching a large database for the images that are most similar to the query, based on image features that are automatically extracted by the software. The philosophy of this approach is to help inform the radiologist's diagnosis in difficult cases by presenting relevant information from past cases. The retrieved example lesions will allow the radiologist to explicitly compare known cases to the unknown case. A key advantage of the proposed retrieval approach to CAD is that it leaves decision-making entirely in the hands of the radiologist, unlike CADx, which acts as a supplemental decision maker.  In our approach, we aim to tackle the key challenge of image retrieval, which is to develop a meaningful computerized measure of the similarity (relevance) of a patient's images to other images in the database. Departing from typical approaches based on numerical distance measures, we have proposed that the most useful measure of similarity is one that is designed specifically to match that perceived by the radiologist. We postulate that the radiologist's notion of similarity is some complicated unknown function of the images, and use advanced machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies.  Under R21 funding, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and good performance of our approach in small data sets. The purpose of this proposed R01 project is to follow up the R21 project with a significantly larger scale effort in order to bring this approach to fruition, which will lead to a suite of retrieval-based CAD tools. We will develop the following unique components toward a clinical diagnostic aid: 1) instead of using indexing terms or simple distance measures to identify relevant images in the database, the system will use a similarity measure specifically trained to match radiologists' notion of relevance, as inferred from data obtained in an observer study; 2) in addition to presenting the retrieved cases to the radiologist, the system will use them to boost a CADx classifier to improve its classification accuracy on the query lesion; 3) the system will have the new capability of automatically building a large reference library by extracting known cases from a hospital PACS, thereby maximizing the benefit by retrieving more-similar cases; and 4) the system will be augmented with a highly interactive interface, which will include new tools for automatically adapting the similarity measure according to users' preferences, and for effectively presenting retrieved results. All of these components are novel and important to ultimate success of this kind of diagnostic aid.  The project will include a preliminary demonstration using the Hospital Information System at the University of Chicago Hospitals, and will include preliminary evaluation studies to determine the effect of the system on radiologists' diagnostic performance.  Project Narrative This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database. The proposed system will make available to the radiologist through an intuitive interface a broad selection of relevant past cases to the one being diagnosed, along with an improved measure of its malignancy that is boosted by using retrieved cases, from which the radiologist can draw his or her own conclusions. We hypothesize that by providing such case-based evidence it will help radiologists in their decision-making process, particularly in diagnosis of difficult cases.",A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval,8300707,R01EB009905,"['Algorithms', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Hospital Information Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Philosophy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'novel', 'preference', 'radiologist', 'success', 'tool', 'vector']",NIBIB,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2012,320346,8894636,0.09435052407997428
"Cloud-computer-aided diagnostic imaging decision support system     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-performance cloud computing (HPCC) is an integration of high-performance computing (HPC) with cloud computing that provides an alternative informatics infrastructure to deliver the supercomputer power needed for developing and reading high quality, multidimensional diagnostic images on desktop or mobile devices. Such infrastructure would advance the use of high-throughput cancer screening like virtual colonoscopy (VC), also known as computed tomography colonography (CTC). The goals of this proposal are to develop and validate the clinical benefits of a mobile HPCC-Virtual Colonoscopy decision support system (HPCC-VC) that integrates novel high-performance electronic cleansing and computer-aided detection schemes. The combination of high performance electronic cleansing (hpEC) with high performance computer aided detection (hpCAD) will allow visualization of the entire mucosal surface of the colon without artifact. Specifically, we hypothesize that the mobile HPCC-VC system will improve the quality of electronic cleansing of non-cathartic CTC (ncCTC) images, will deliver images 100 times faster than conventional approaches, and will improve reader performance in the detection of colonic lesions in the images analyzed on mobile high-resolution display devices.  To achieve these goals, an HPCC platform will be established by use of a CPU-cluster-based supercomputing and parallel image processing libraries. Then, an hpEC scheme will be developed that effectively removes the residual fecal materials in ncCTC images. In parallel, a high-resolution hpCAD scheme will be developed to support high-performance detection of colonic lesions in ncCTC. These schemes will be integrated into a mobile HPCC-VC system on the HPCC platform. Necessary preliminary studies in the development of computed EC and CAD schemes show promise; and the development and deployment of the HPCC platform will advance the quality, speed, and utility of high performance, multidimensional imaging for colon cancer screening. A comprehensive reader performance study will be conducted to determine the clinical application and benefit of images analyzed and delivered through an HPCC platform.  Successful development of HPCC-VC will demonstrate the clinical benefit of the platform for improved diagnostic imaging and facilitation of accurate, high-throughput colon cancer screening that is highly acceptable to patients. In the longer term, broad adoption and use of the HPCC-VC system will facilitate early and accurate diagnoses, and thus reduce mortality from colon cancer.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful development of the HPCC-VC system will demonstrate the clinical benefit of HPCC platform for diagnostic imaging, and will provide a high-throughput colon cancer screening scheme for colorectal lesions that is highly acceptable to patients and highly accurate.

"Computer-aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include (1) collecting a large data set to develop and evaluate our CAD algorithms and systems, (2) establishing ""gold standard"" for performance evaluation, (3) developing robust pulmonary vessel segmentation methods, (4) developing robust pulmonary vessel tree reconstruction method to accurately track pulmonary vessels, trim veins and surrounding extensive lung diseases from vessel tree, and label reconstructed arterial tree, (5) developing and improving PE detection algorithms, including multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, PE features extraction for development of classification methods, false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) developing automatic PE index estimation method, (7) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (8) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms   Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.  Narrative:  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.",Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms,8206668,R01HL106545,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Calcified', 'Calcium', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Stenosis', 'Stratification', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'computer aided detection', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'pre-clinical', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,585438,641965656,0.05299714978039279
"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice. The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM. The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading. We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project. If we are successful in achieving our aims, we will have a practical solution to the MC detection problems in DBT. We will produce an MC-enhanced and CAD-assisted reading protocol that will serve as a model for DBT system and workstation design. This will pave the way for the acceptance of DBT for clinical use, thereby improving the sensitivity and specificity of breast cancer screening which will benefit all women.",Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis,8327742,R01CA151443,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Label', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lesion', 'Mammography', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modality', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer aided detection', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'digital models', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2012,628690,641965656,0.10720780043508593
"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,8082739,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2011,146799,136810522,0.13492096811039855
"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          n/a",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,8065906,R01CA077850,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Benign', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Genetic Programming', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'calcification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,269902,570146095,0.1551011756611623
"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.           7.

"A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The predominant approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging has been to use automated image analysis to serve as a ""second reader,"" with the aim of improving radiologists' diagnostic performance. CAD techniques traditionally aim to highlight suspicious lesions (called CADe) and/or estimate diagnostic variables, such as probability of malignancy (called CADx). We have been developing and evaluating a different approach to CAD, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will automatically identify and display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated (referred to as the query). This will involve searching a large database for the images that are most similar to the query, based on image features that are automatically extracted by the software. The philosophy of this approach is to help inform the radiologist's diagnosis in difficult cases by presenting relevant information from past cases. The retrieved example lesions will allow the radiologist to explicitly compare known cases to the unknown case. A key advantage of the proposed retrieval approach to CAD is that it leaves decision-making entirely in the hands of the radiologist, unlike CADx, which acts as a supplemental decision maker. In our approach, we aim to tackle the key challenge of image retrieval, which is to develop a meaningful computerized measure of the similarity (relevance) of a patient's images to other images in the database. Departing from typical approaches based on numerical distance measures, we have proposed that the most useful measure of similarity is one that is designed specifically to match that perceived by the radiologist. We postulate that the radiologist's notion of similarity is some complicated unknown function of the images, and use advanced machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. Under R21 funding, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and good performance of our approach in small data sets. The purpose of this proposed R01 project is to follow up the R21 project with a significantly larger scale effort in order to bring this approach to fruition, which will lead to a suite of retrieval-based CAD tools. We will develop the following unique components toward a clinical diagnostic aid: 1) instead of using indexing terms or simple distance measures to identify relevant images in the database, the system will use a similarity measure specifically trained to match radiologists' notion of relevance, as inferred from data obtained in an observer study; 2) in addition to presenting the retrieved cases to the radiologist, the system will use them to boost a CADx classifier to improve its classification accuracy on the query lesion; 3) the system will have the new capability of automatically building a large reference library by extracting known cases from a hospital PACS, thereby maximizing the benefit by retrieving more-similar cases; and 4) the system will be augmented with a highly interactive interface, which will include new tools for automatically adapting the similarity measure according to users' preferences, and for effectively presenting retrieved results. All of these components are novel and important to ultimate success of this kind of diagnostic aid. The project will include a preliminary demonstration using the Hospital Information System at the University of Chicago Hospitals, and will include preliminary evaluation studies to determine the effect of the system on radiologists' diagnostic performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database. The proposed system will make available to the radiologist through an intuitive interface a broad selection of relevant past cases to the one being diagnosed, along with an improved measure of its malignancy that is boosted by using retrieved cases, from which the radiologist can draw his or her own conclusions. We hypothesize that by providing such case-based evidence it will help radiologists in their decision-making process, particularly in diagnosis of difficult cases.           Project Narrative This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database.

"Computer-aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include (1) collecting a large data set to develop and evaluate our CAD algorithms and systems, (2) establishing ""gold standard"" for performance evaluation, (3) developing robust pulmonary vessel segmentation methods, (4) developing robust pulmonary vessel tree reconstruction method to accurately track pulmonary vessels, trim veins and surrounding extensive lung diseases from vessel tree, and label reconstructed arterial tree, (5) developing and improving PE detection algorithms, including multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, PE features extraction for development of classification methods, false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) developing automatic PE index estimation method, (7) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (8) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.            The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs.

"Computer-aided detection of non-calcified plaques in coronary CT angiograms    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. Over 16 million Americans have coronary heart disease (CHD), causing about 0.5 million deaths each year. The most common CHD is coronary artery disease which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis. Clinical evidence in recent years shows that noncalcified plaques (NCPs) are more vulnerable to rupture than calcified plaques. Plaque rupture and the thrombosis that follows is the main cause of acute myocardial infarction. Multidetector coronary CT angiography (cCTA) has the potential to help clinicians in early detection and in quantification of NCPs. cCTA may thus be useful for CHD detection, risk stratification, monitoring, and evaluation of the effectiveness of risk reduction treatment. However, many of these potential applications have not been utilized clinically.  The goal of this project is to develop a computer-aided detection (CADe) system to serve as a second reader for assisting clinicians in detection and quantification of NCPs in cCTA exams. Our specific aims are to (1) develop machine learning methods for detection of NCPs causing stenosis and/or positive remodeling along coronary arteries, and (2) evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs on cCTA by observer ROC study. To achieve these aims, we will collect a database of cCTA cases for training and testing the CADe system, define the search space by designing 3D multiscale coronary artery response enhancement, segmentation, and dynamic balloon vessel tracking methods, develop a unique vessel- stitching method to automatically identify the best-quality phase for each individual artery segment from all available phases in prospectively or retrospectively gated cCTA exams, develop innovative vessel-sector- profile analysis and vessel lumen analysis to detect NCPs that cause stenosis or positive remodeling, estimate the total NCP volume, and explore calibration method to quantify plaque density by phantom studies. To demonstrate the usefulness of CADe, a preclinical reader study will be conducted to compare radiologists' detection accuracy of NCPs with and without CADe.  The major innovations of this project include (1) being the first CADe system to automatically detect non-calcified plaques including those cause positive remodeling or stenosis in cCTA, (2) development of new machine learning techniques including the vessel-stitching method, vessel-sector-profile analysis, multiscale enhancement response, and dynamic balloon tracking specifically suited for coronary arterial trees, and (3) conducting the first ROC study to evaluate the effect of CADe on radiologists' detection of NCPs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. If the proposed CADe system is successfully developed, it will (1) provide an accurate, efficient, and consistent tool to assist clinicians in detecting and quantifying non-calcified plaques (NCP) including those causing positive remodeling and/or stenosis for an individual patient, (2) help clinicians estimate the total NCP burden and study its significance, in analogy to that of the total calcium score, which may lead to improved clinical management of the vulnerable plaques, and (3) accelerate studies to develop new treatment options of coronary heart disease by providing a monitoring tool of treatment response. The proposed CADe system can thus serve as a foundation for these broader future applications and improve the efficacy of cCTA. Improved detection and management of NCPs may reduce the risk of myocardial infarctions and will have strong and long-lasting impact on health care.           Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.

"Improvement of microcalcification detection in digital breast tomosynthesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Screening mammography has limited sensitivity and specificity. Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an emerging modality that has been shown to significantly improve the detection and characterization of soft- tissue lesions. However, initial studies have shown that subtle microcalcification (MC) clusters, which are often the only sign of early breast cancer, can be difficult to visualize in DBT. Some have suggested that DBT be used in parallel with FFDM in screening, (i.e., adding one- or two-view DBT to the two-view FFDMs so that FFDM could be used for MC detection while DBT could be used for mass detection). This approach would increase imaging costs, reading time, and patient dose, which are all major concerns with regards to introducing DBT into clinical practice.  The main goal of the proposed Partnership between the University of Michigan Computer-Aided Diagnosis Research Laboratory (UM) and GE Global Research (GE) is to develop an integrated practical approach to resolving the MC visualization and detection problems in DBT without increasing patient dose, thereby facilitating the eventual replacement of FFDM by DBT. To achieve this goal, we propose two Specific Aims: (SA1) to develop specially designed MC enhancing methods to improve human and machine visualization of MCs in DBT and develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) system to highlight significant MC clusters, and (SA2) to implement the developed MC-enhancing and CAD reading tools in a DBT workstation and conduct observer performance studies to compare MC detection in DBT with that in FFDM.  The following tasks will be conducted to accomplish the specific aims: (1) perform phantom studies to determine the best set of image acquisition parameters for data collection, (2) collect a database of human subject DBTs for development of algorithms and observer study, (3) develop lesion-specific reconstruction and MC enhancing methods to improve the visibility of MCs in DBT for radiologist's reading and computerized detection, (4) develop computer-vision methods to detect MC candidates, (5) develop MC analysis method to reduce false positives (FPs) and insignificant CAD marks, (6) design two-view analysis to further reduce FPs, (7) study dependence of MC detection on reconstruction methods and tomosynthesis acquisition parameters, and (8) design a DBT workstation implemented with the MC-enhancing and CAD- assisted tools to highlight significant MCs for radiologist's reading.  We hypothesize that the specially designed DBT display system can assist radiologists in detection of MCs in DBT with accuracy at least comparable to that in FFDM. To test this hypothesis, we will (9) conduct observer ROC studies to compare the detection accuracy of MCs under three conditions: (a) two-view DBT without CAD vs. two-view FFDM without CAD, (b) two-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD, and (c) a special protocol of CC-view FFDM plus MLO-view DBT with CAD vs. two-view FFDM with CAD. DBT is a promising modality for improving breast cancer detection. It is widely regarded that DBT is superior to FFDM for detecting soft-tissue lesions. This Partnership between UM and GE aims at finding an integrated, effective solution to address the critical remaining issue of MC visualization and detection in DBT. The partners bring unique and complementary capabilities to the proposed program. GE has expertise in the design of DBT systems, image analysis, workstation implementation, and most importantly, limited-angle tomosynthesis and full-angle CT reconstruction in practical commercial imaging systems. UM has extensive experience in development of CAD methods and DBT imaging, medical physicists with expertise in the evaluation of x-ray systems, and strong clinical support from the Breast Imaging Division within one of the top academic radiology departments in the country. Together, UM and GE have the full complement of skills, experience, and resources required for success on this important public health project. If we are successful in achieving our aims, we will have a practical solution to the MC detection problems in DBT. We will produce an MC-enhanced and CAD-assisted reading protocol that will serve as a model for DBT system and workstation design.

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,7871344,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2010,145649,136810522,0.13492096811039855
"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          n/a",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,7797472,R01CA077850,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Benign', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Genetic Programming', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2010,278249,570146095,0.1551011756611623
"Computer-Aided Detection of Urinary Tract Cancer on MDCT Urography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Urinary tract neoplasm is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among patients.  Bladder and upper urinary tract cancer causes 14800 deaths per year in the United States. It is expected that 71100 new bladder and upper urinary tract cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2008. Multi-detector row CT (MDCT) urography is currently a very promising imaging modality for early detection of bladder and upper urinary tract cancer, which can be a cause of hematuria.  The prevalence of hematuria can be as high as 19% in elderly patients.  Interpretation of MDCT urograms (CTU) that commonly exceeds 400 slices is a demanding task for radiologists who have to visually track the upper and lower urinary tract and look for lesions which usually are small in size. In addition, some bladder lesions can be in the bladder area filled with contrast and some in the area without contrast. The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system to assist radiologists in interpretation of CTUs.  In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the development of the first computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the detection of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTU images.  We hypothesize that the use of CAD system can improve the radiologists' accuracy in detecting bladder and upper urinary tract cancer on CTUs.  To test this hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of bladder and upper urinary tract malignant and benign lesions; (2) develop new computer vision techniques to process 3-dimensional (3D) volumetric CTUs; (3) develop algorithms to detect bladder lesions; (4) develop algorithms to detect upper urinary tract lesions; and (5) compare the detection accuracy of bladder and upper urinary tract lesions on CTUs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. In order to accomplish these tasks, we will develop new image analysis techniques for automated tracking of the ureter and segmentation of the inner and outer walls of the bladder and the ureter. New methods will be designed specifically for detection of lesion candidates in the bladder and the ureter. We will design methods and 3D measures for estimating asymmetries of the bladder wall thickness and detection of ureteral wall thickening.  Feature extraction techniques and robust classification methods will be developed for identification of true positive and elimination of false positive lesions using the extracted features. If successfully developed, the CAD system can potentially improve the performance of the radiologists in detecting urothelial neoplasm as well as in interpreting CTU for patients with hematuria, allowing the detection of additional cancers at earlier stage. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The main goals of this project are (1) to develop a computer aided detection (CAD) system to assist radiologists in detection of bladder and upper urinary tract abnormalities on multi-detector row CT urography (CTU) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection of lesions on CTUs. The proposed CAD system for CTU will be a new and unique application of computerized techniques for analysis of urothelial neoplasms. The relevance of this project to public health is that CAD can potentially increase the efficacy of CTU for urothelial neoplasm detection by improving the performance and reducing the variability of both the experienced and the less experienced radiologists. Accurate identification of the cause of disease such as hematuria by CTU can spare the patient considerable effort of undergoing a potentially large number of imaging studies, and thus reduce cost by eliminating the additional imaging. Early detection can improve the prognosis and survival of the patients.           7.

"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis. The proposed technique has significant clinical potentials in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment as well.          n/a",A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis,7841805,R01CA115320,"['Algorithms', 'Belief', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'Databases', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal Cell', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'design', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2010,313901,9101010,0.05562627889561765
"A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The predominant approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging has been to use automated image analysis to serve as a ""second reader,"" with the aim of improving radiologists' diagnostic performance. CAD techniques traditionally aim to highlight suspicious lesions (called CADe) and/or estimate diagnostic variables, such as probability of malignancy (called CADx). We have been developing and evaluating a different approach to CAD, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will automatically identify and display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated (referred to as the query). This will involve searching a large database for the images that are most similar to the query, based on image features that are automatically extracted by the software. The philosophy of this approach is to help inform the radiologist's diagnosis in difficult cases by presenting relevant information from past cases. The retrieved example lesions will allow the radiologist to explicitly compare known cases to the unknown case. A key advantage of the proposed retrieval approach to CAD is that it leaves decision-making entirely in the hands of the radiologist, unlike CADx, which acts as a supplemental decision maker. In our approach, we aim to tackle the key challenge of image retrieval, which is to develop a meaningful computerized measure of the similarity (relevance) of a patient's images to other images in the database. Departing from typical approaches based on numerical distance measures, we have proposed that the most useful measure of similarity is one that is designed specifically to match that perceived by the radiologist. We postulate that the radiologist's notion of similarity is some complicated unknown function of the images, and use advanced machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. Under R21 funding, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and good performance of our approach in small data sets. The purpose of this proposed R01 project is to follow up the R21 project with a significantly larger scale effort in order to bring this approach to fruition, which will lead to a suite of retrieval-based CAD tools. We will develop the following unique components toward a clinical diagnostic aid: 1) instead of using indexing terms or simple distance measures to identify relevant images in the database, the system will use a similarity measure specifically trained to match radiologists' notion of relevance, as inferred from data obtained in an observer study; 2) in addition to presenting the retrieved cases to the radiologist, the system will use them to boost a CADx classifier to improve its classification accuracy on the query lesion; 3) the system will have the new capability of automatically building a large reference library by extracting known cases from a hospital PACS, thereby maximizing the benefit by retrieving more-similar cases; and 4) the system will be augmented with a highly interactive interface, which will include new tools for automatically adapting the similarity measure according to users' preferences, and for effectively presenting retrieved results. All of these components are novel and important to ultimate success of this kind of diagnostic aid. The project will include a preliminary demonstration using the Hospital Information System at the University of Chicago Hospitals, and will include preliminary evaluation studies to determine the effect of the system on radiologists' diagnostic performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database. The proposed system will make available to the radiologist through an intuitive interface a broad selection of relevant past cases to the one being diagnosed, along with an improved measure of its malignancy that is boosted by using retrieved cases, from which the radiologist can draw his or her own conclusions. We hypothesize that by providing such case-based evidence it will help radiologists in their decision-making process, particularly in diagnosis of difficult cases.           Project Narrative This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database.

"Computer-aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include (1) collecting a large data set to develop and evaluate our CAD algorithms and systems, (2) establishing ""gold standard"" for performance evaluation, (3) developing robust pulmonary vessel segmentation methods, (4) developing robust pulmonary vessel tree reconstruction method to accurately track pulmonary vessels, trim veins and surrounding extensive lung diseases from vessel tree, and label reconstructed arterial tree, (5) developing and improving PE detection algorithms, including multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, PE features extraction for development of classification methods, false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) developing automatic PE index estimation method, (7) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (8) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.            The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs.

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients.

The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model.

This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,7648119,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2009,144531,136810522,0.13492096811039855
"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Bladder cancer is the fifth cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Often the cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage after the patients have developed symptoms, explaining their high mortality rates. Since most colon cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated. Unfortunately most people do not follow this recommendation. A similar situation exists for bladder tumor staging. The health relatedness of this project is to dramatically increase the number of people willing to participate in screening programs by offering a convenient, nearly risk-free procedure. Virtual colonoscopy (VCon) and virtual cystoscopy (VCys), as new procedures in which computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images of the patient's abdomen are taken and a computer visualization system is used to virtually navigate within a constructed 3D model of the colon or bladder, has demonstrated the potential for colon cancer screening and bladder tumor evaluation. We have been contributing the VCon and VCys development for several years. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop 3D texture-based computer aided detection (txCAD) techniques to facilitate VCon and VCys as accurate, cost-effective, non-invasive, comfortable techniques to screen large segments of the population. The Phase I specific aims are: (1) To develop tissue-mixture image segmentation mitigating the partial volume effect. (2) To extract the mucosa layer and cleanse the lumen space of the hollow organs from the segmentation. (3) To identify suspicious patches in the mucosa layer with high sensitivity and reasonable false negatives. (4) To obtain the entire volume of each suspicious patch. The Phase II aims are: (5) To extract 3D geometrical, morphological and texture information from each suspicious volume. (6) To classify the extracted features using learning machine to eliminate false positives. (7) To evaluate the performance of the proposed txCAD on a patient database of over 200 cases. It is hypothesized that the proposed txCAD will significantly improve the detection performance compared to previous geometry-based CAD (sfCAD), and dramatically reduces the physician's interaction time with our developed VCon and VCys systems.           n/a",Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images,7659680,R33CA120917,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Digital Mammography', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fiber Optics', 'Genus Cola', 'Global Change', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Invaded', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cost', 'density', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tumor', 'vector', 'virtual']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R33,2009,246087,77607041,0.05256058134866284
"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          n/a",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,7617655,R01CA077850,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Benign', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Genetic Programming', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical practice', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,246949,570146095,0.1551011756611623
"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7677385,R33CA118305,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'System', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multimodality', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2009,307479,641965656,0.11697000648524467
"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis. The proposed technique has significant clinical potentials in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment as well.          n/a",A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis,7609064,R01CA115320,"['Algorithms', 'Belief', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'Databases', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal Cell', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'design', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2009,308319,9101010,0.05562627889561765
"A suite of diagnostic aids based on image retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The predominant approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) in medical imaging has been to use automated image analysis to serve as a ""second reader,"" with the aim of improving radiologists' diagnostic performance. CAD techniques traditionally aim to highlight suspicious lesions (called CADe) and/or estimate diagnostic variables, such as probability of malignancy (called CADx). We have been developing and evaluating a different approach to CAD, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will automatically identify and display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated (referred to as the query). This will involve searching a large database for the images that are most similar to the query, based on image features that are automatically extracted by the software. The philosophy of this approach is to help inform the radiologist's diagnosis in difficult cases by presenting relevant information from past cases. The retrieved example lesions will allow the radiologist to explicitly compare known cases to the unknown case. A key advantage of the proposed retrieval approach to CAD is that it leaves decision-making entirely in the hands of the radiologist, unlike CADx, which acts as a supplemental decision maker. In our approach, we aim to tackle the key challenge of image retrieval, which is to develop a meaningful computerized measure of the similarity (relevance) of a patient's images to other images in the database. Departing from typical approaches based on numerical distance measures, we have proposed that the most useful measure of similarity is one that is designed specifically to match that perceived by the radiologist. We postulate that the radiologist's notion of similarity is some complicated unknown function of the images, and use advanced machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. Under R21 funding, we successfully demonstrated the feasibility and good performance of our approach in small data sets. The purpose of this proposed R01 project is to follow up the R21 project with a significantly larger scale effort in order to bring this approach to fruition, which will lead to a suite of retrieval-based CAD tools. We will develop the following unique components toward a clinical diagnostic aid: 1) instead of using indexing terms or simple distance measures to identify relevant images in the database, the system will use a similarity measure specifically trained to match radiologists' notion of relevance, as inferred from data obtained in an observer study; 2) in addition to presenting the retrieved cases to the radiologist, the system will use them to boost a CADx classifier to improve its classification accuracy on the query lesion; 3) the system will have the new capability of automatically building a large reference library by extracting known cases from a hospital PACS, thereby maximizing the benefit by retrieving more-similar cases; and 4) the system will be augmented with a highly interactive interface, which will include new tools for automatically adapting the similarity measure according to users' preferences, and for effectively presenting retrieved results. All of these components are novel and important to ultimate success of this kind of diagnostic aid. The project will include a preliminary demonstration using the Hospital Information System at the University of Chicago Hospitals, and will include preliminary evaluation studies to determine the effect of the system on radiologists' diagnostic performance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database. The proposed system will make available to the radiologist through an intuitive interface a broad selection of relevant past cases to the one being diagnosed, along with an improved measure of its malignancy that is boosted by using retrieved cases, from which the radiologist can draw his or her own conclusions. We hypothesize that by providing such case-based evidence it will help radiologists in their decision-making process, particularly in diagnosis of difficult cases.           Project Narrative This project will focus on development of a suite of supporting tools to facilitate the interpretation of images in radiology by mining similar cases from a database.

"Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a new modality that holds the promise of improving mammographic sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, especially for dense breasts. The main goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided detection (CADd) system for breast masses in DTM, (2) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of malignant and benign masses in DTM, and (3) to evaluate the effects of CAD (either CADd or CADx) on radiologists' interpretation of DTMs. Previous CAD systems are developed for regular projection mammograms (PMs).The proposed CAD system makes use of the 3-dimensional (3D) information in DTM to improve mass detection and characterization. The innovations in the proposed project include: (1) development of new computer-vision techniques to exploit the 3D volumetric information in DTMs, (2) evaluation of the dependence of CAD performance on reconstruction algorithms, and (3) comparison of computerized mass detection and characterization in DTMs, projection view mammograms (PVs) (the non-reconstructed mammograms taken at multiple angles during tomosynthesis imaging), and PMs. We hypothesize that detection and characterization of masses on DTMs will be more accurate than corresponding tasks on regular PMs, and that the CAD systems can improve radiologists' accuracy. 3D breast phantoms with test objects will be designed and imaged with a prototype DTM system. The dependence of DTM image quality on reconstruction algorithms and their parameters, and on image acquisition techniques will be studied. The appropriate reconstruction techniques will be selected based on phantom and patient studies. A database of DTMs and corresponding PMs with malignant and benign masses and a set of normal cases will be collected with patient informed consent. CAD systems for detection and classification of masses will be developed. Two approaches will be compared: one uses the reconstructed DTM slices and the other uses the PVs as input to the CAD systems. For the DTMs, new techniques for 3D preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature classification will be designed. For the PVs, our previous techniques developed for regular PMs will be adapted to these low- dose images, and information fusion methods using techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines will be developed to merge the multiple-PV information. To test our hypotheses, we will compare the CAD system performances from these two approaches and that from the corresponding regular PMs, and conduct observer ROC studies to evaluate effects of the CAD systems on radiologists' performance. CAD will be an important tool that can help accelerate the implementation of DTM in clinical practice. DTM with CAD is expected to help fully utilize the potential of this new modality to improve breast cancer detection.           n/a",Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses,7668403,R33CA120234,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Informed Consent', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Mass in breast', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2009,389926,641965656,0.13742148602011936
"Computer-aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images.

"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,7448570,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2008,131394,136810522,0.13492096811039855
"Information-Theoretic Based CAD in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a novel computer-assisted decision (CAD) scheme for improving the clinical detection of breast masses in screening mammograms. The CAD scheme combines information-theoretic similarity metrics with knowledge-based decision algorithms. It will help radiologists scrutinize mammograms providing evidence-based decision support. Given a query mammographic region, the CAD system will interrogate a database of archived mammograms, examine similar eases, and assign a likelihood measure regarding the presence of a potentially malignant mass.  The study proposes the formulation of information-theoretic metrics to quantify the similarity of two mammographic regions. The similarity metrics are based on Sharmon's entropy; a measure of complexity (or information) contained in an image. Theoretically, if two mammographic regions depict similar structures, they should contain diagnostic information for each other. The amount of relevant diagnostic information can be measured by entropy-based similarity metrics that are computed directly from the images without requiring segmentation or feature extraction. Using the similarity metrics and an image databank of mammographic cases with known truth, a knowledge-bussed CAD scheme will be implemented for the detection of masses in screening mammograms. Preliminary studies have established that standard mutual information (MI) is an effective similarity metric for the task.  The specific aims of the study are: (1) To fully exploit information-theoretic metrics that measure the similar content of two mammographic regions, (2) To optimize their contributions in an evidence-based decision algorithm for the early detection of potentially malignant masses, and (3) To perform preliminary clinical evaluation of the CAD system.  As digital image libraries are an upcoming trend in radiology, the proposed CAD system will take advantage of continuously deposited mammograms with established ground truth. The system aims to reduce the interpretation error associated with screening mammograms and/or the false positives generated by cuing CAD schemes, Overall, the study aims to improve the sensitivity while maintaining or improving the specificity of screening mammography for masses. n/a",Information-Theoretic Based CAD in Mammography,7336275,R01CA101911,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Interface', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Entropy', 'Image', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Physicians', 'Purpose', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'concept', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'statistics', 'trend']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,230712,607172798,0.1317704609159886
"Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Bladder cancer is the fifth cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Often the cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage after the patients have developed symptoms, explaining their high mortality rates. Since most colon cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated. Unfortunately most people do not follow this recommendation. A similar situation exists for bladder tumor staging. The health relatedness of this project is to dramatically increase the number of people willing to participate in screening programs by offering a convenient, nearly risk-free procedure. Virtual colonoscopy (VCon) and virtual cystoscopy (VCys), as new procedures in which computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images of the patient's abdomen are taken and a computer visualization system is used to virtually navigate within a constructed 3D model of the colon or bladder, has demonstrated the potential for colon cancer screening and bladder tumor evaluation. We have been contributing the VCon and VCys development for several years. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop 3D texture-based computer aided detection (txCAD) techniques to facilitate VCon and VCys as accurate, cost-effective, non-invasive, comfortable techniques to screen large segments of the population. The Phase I specific aims are: (1) To develop tissue-mixture image segmentation mitigating the partial volume effect. (2) To extract the mucosa layer and cleanse the lumen space of the hollow organs from the segmentation. (3) To identify suspicious patches in the mucosa layer with high sensitivity and reasonable false negatives. (4) To obtain the entire volume of each suspicious patch. The Phase II aims are: (5) To extract 3D geometrical, morphological and texture information from each suspicious volume. (6) To classify the extracted features using learning machine to eliminate false positives. (7) To evaluate the performance of the proposed txCAD on a patient database of over 200 cases. It is hypothesized that the proposed txCAD will significantly improve the detection performance compared to previous geometry-based CAD (sfCAD), and dramatically reduces the physician's interaction time with our developed VCon and VCys systems.           n/a",Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images,7657558,R33CA120917,"['Abdomen', 'Advocate', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Evaluation', 'Genus Cola', 'Health', 'Imagery', 'Invasive', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Numbers', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Risk', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cost', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'virtual']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R33,2008,243782,77607041,0.05256058134866284
"Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computer-aided detection (CAD) of breast cancer is rapidly becoming a well accepted clinical practice. Studies have found that radiologists' attitude toward and acceptance of CAD-cued micro-calcification clusters and masses were substantially different. Due to the high sensitivity, radiologists heavily rely on CAD-cued results while searching for micro-calcifications. However, the lower CAD sensitivity for mass detection (including a fraction of subtle masses being cued only on one view) and the higher false-positive detection (FP) rates reduce radiologists' confidence in CAD-cued masses. As a result, radiologists frequently discard CAD-cued subtle masses in the clinical practice. To improve CAD performance and increase radiologists' confidence in using CAD-cued masses in their decision making, we propose two observer-focused innovative approaches to develop and optimize CAD schemes. By maintaining a comparable FP rate to current commercial CAD systems, the new approaches aim to either increase the number of masses being cued on both ipsilateral (CC and MLO) views or cue more subtle masses by eliminating a fraction of other regions that can be easily identified and classified by radiologists without using CAD. To test these approaches, we propose three specific tasks. First, we will develop a unique multi-view based CAD scheme. To more sensitively detect and better match subtle mass regions, we introduce a concept of limited viewing of specific regions into the arena of CAD development. After detecting a matching strip on the ipsolateral view, the scheme applies a second highly sensitive detection scheme only to this strip to identify matched regions. To control for and reduce FP rates, the scheme limits the number of possible matched candidates to less than one per image. Second, we will develop an integrated CAD scheme that includes a combined score for both detection and classification. To improve direct use of features computed by the detection module in the classification task, we will apply a new dual active contour algorithm that should improve mass region segmentation. We will separately optimize two machine learning classifiers to generate a detection score (the likelihood of being a true-positive mass) and a classification score (the likelihood of each detected mass for malignancy) for each segmented region. We will then develop a fusion method to combine these two scores and generate a new summary index that is more heavily weighted for subtle masses. Using this scheme, we can change the current mass detection based cuing method to a new cancer-based cueing method. Third, we will conduct a pilot observer performance study to investigate radiologists' performance under three CADcueing modes (using the current commercial single-image based, the new multi-view based, and the new integrated CAD schemes). The reading results will be compared and analyzed using both ROC and JAFROC methodologies. We note that the approach is substantially different than focusing on incremental improvements in image based detection schemes in that the observer's actual use (or not) of the CADcued regions drives our objectives in this project, resulting in a targeted development effort.          n/a",Improving Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis with CAD,7522346,R01CA077850,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attitude', 'Benign', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Genetic Programming', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Numbers', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Purpose', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'calcification', 'concept', 'desire', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2008,247081,570146095,0.1551011756611623
"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7665198,R33CA118305,"['Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Retrieval', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2008,302577,641965656,0.11697000648524467

"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis.

"Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a new modality that holds the promise of improving mammographic sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, especially for dense breasts. The main goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided detection (CADd) system for breast masses in DTM, (2) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of malignant and benign masses in DTM, and (3) to evaluate the effects of CAD (either CADd or CADx) on radiologists' interpretation of DTMs. Previous CAD systems are developed for regular projection mammograms (PMs).The proposed CAD system makes use of the 3-dimensional (3D) information in DTM to improve mass detection and characterization. The innovations in the proposed project include: (1) development of new computer-vision techniques to exploit the 3D volumetric information in DTMs, (2) evaluation of the dependence of CAD performance on reconstruction algorithms, and (3) comparison of computerized mass detection and characterization in DTMs, projection view mammograms (PVs) (the non-reconstructed mammograms taken at multiple angles during tomosynthesis imaging), and PMs. We hypothesize that detection and characterization of masses on DTMs will be more accurate than corresponding tasks on regular PMs, and that the CAD systems can improve radiologists' accuracy. 3D breast phantoms with test objects will be designed and imaged with a prototype DTM system. The dependence of DTM image quality on reconstruction algorithms and their parameters, and on image acquisition techniques will be studied. The appropriate reconstruction techniques will be selected based on phantom and patient studies. A database of DTMs and corresponding PMs with malignant and benign masses and a set of normal cases will be collected with patient informed consent. CAD systems for detection and classification of masses will be developed. Two approaches will be compared: one uses the reconstructed DTM slices and the other uses the PVs as input to the CAD systems. For the DTMs, new techniques for 3D preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature classification will be designed. For the PVs, our previous techniques developed for regular PMs will be adapted to these low- dose images, and information fusion methods using techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines will be developed to merge the multiple-PV information. To test our hypotheses, we will compare the CAD system performances from these two approaches and that from the corresponding regular PMs, and conduct observer ROC studies to evaluate effects of the CAD systems on radiologists' performance. CAD will be an important tool that can help accelerate the implementation of DTM in clinical practice. DTM with CAD is expected to help fully utilize the potential of this new modality to improve breast cancer detection.           n/a",Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses,7500088,R33CA120234,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Informed Consent', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Mass in breast', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R33,2008,379995,641965656,0.13742148602011936
"New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this project we hypothesize that a comprehensive clinical case library with intelligent agents can sort and render clinically similar cases and present clinically significant features, to assist the radiologist in interpreting mammograms. This computer library system is designed to integrate, search, and analyze clinical data that are analogous to the study case. In normal clinical practice, experienced radiologists often refer to their personal mental images of previous proven cases in making diagnoses and patient management decisions.  Providing a computerized library can refresh a radiologist's mental memory with a broad array of proven cases and concrete visualizations. The system can also assist less experienced radiologists in making diagnoses by referring them not only to histologically proven cases but also to the statistical distribution of features. Freed from bias induced by their recent experience, radiologists can use such a library system to improve the diagnostic accuracy at large. This approach differs greatly from conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods. One can also expect that by adding the radiologist's guidance - for example BI-RADS descriptors - into the proposed mammographic library system will lead to increase the searching accuracy and achieve a greater diagnostic outcome.  Technically speaking, this project differs from previous mammographic CADx and image-based retrieval methods in its emphasis on using local vector features and sector fuzzy features of the mammographic masses supported by our newly-invented maximum likelihood fuzzy shadow techniques and multiple circular path convolution neural network. In addition, the recent technical advances in image retrieval using the fuzzy feature matching method and hyper-space analysis techniques have made the success of the proposed approach highly possible.  This computer-based library system can be extended to include other imaging modalities for breast care.  It is conceivable that this comprehensive breast care database can further link local breast care centers through the coming high-speed network system. In addition, this system could also serve as a learning center for clinicians and scientists. This project represents a significant trend in the development of a comprehensive image data system for breast care in the next several decades.            n/a",New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System,7499601,R33CA102960,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Ballistics', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Mammography', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Face', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Intelligence', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maryland', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Other Imaging Modalities', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Printing', 'Psyche structure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rate', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'Subcategory', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Teleradiology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tissues', 'Today', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'concept', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'gun control laws', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'next generation', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'trend', 'vector']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R33,2008,567767,50343425,-0.03008482399108192
"K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Career development goals: To provide sufficient time for mentoring and research activities. Long term research objectives: To study lung cancer screening and its implications for patients. To perform this research, the program will focus on better ways to differentiate benign from malignant nodules discovered on Computed Tomography (CT). This project has three components. The first is the development of improved Computer Aided Detection (CAD) software to aid in identifying lesions and differentiating between benign and malignant nodules based on characteristic CT findings. The second component will test the CAD software against independent readers in clinically meaningful scenarios. The third component will utilize clinical/radiologic findings from patients presenting with indeterminate CT detected nodules to produce a prediction model to improve the ability to differentiate benign from malignant disease. Methods: For project 1 the investigators will collect CT data on lesion phantoms and from patients with characteristic or known presentations. This will lead to the development of CT reconstruction techniques for the specific purposes of automated detections and analysis of small lung nodules. Then, calculation of the precision of nodule volume estimates as a function of the CT reconstruction techniques will be performed. For project 2, CAD can be tested by comparing reader confidence in CT findings before and after CAD is used as a second reader. For project 3 to develop a multivariate statistical model of malignancy potential, clinical, radiographic, and CAD data on patients with CT detected nodules will be collected. Multinomial logistic regression will be used to calculate odds ratios for malignancy. A subset of the patient data will be used as test data to validate the model. The test data will be disjoint from the data used to derive the prediction model.       In lay terms, this project has important implications for public health because lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and a screening program could be very beneficial in reducing the number of deaths from this disease, this can only occur if there is a better way to differentiate the many benign from the few malignant lesions discovered on screening studies. This study proposes to accomplish that goal which will lead to less unnecessary tests and surgeries for non-cancerous lesions and thus improve the efficacy of the lung cancer screening test.              n/a",K24 Mid-Career Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research,7196613,K24CA120494,"['Award', 'Benign', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancerous', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Numbers', 'Odds Ratio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening procedure', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'improved', 'lung cancer screening', 'patient oriented research', 'programs', 'reconstruction']",NCI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,K24,2007,107293,136810522,0.13492096811039855
"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7295701,R21CA118305,"['Address', 'Anxiety', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Image retrieval system', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Score', 'System', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'base', 'case-based', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'radiologist', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R21,2007,151477,0,0.11697000648524467
"Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Preliminary results from the PIOPED II study indicated a sensitivity of 83% by multi-detector CTPA. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE on CTPA scans and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include: (1) developing image preprocessing method to enhance vessel characteristics, (2) developing a new rolling balloon technique in combination with structure analysis to track vessels accurately, including vessels partially or completely occluded by PEs, (3) developing multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, especially for PEs in small subsegmental arteries, (4) analyzing PE features for development of classification methods, (5) developing false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (7) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.         n/a",Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography,7229841,R21EB005851,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Condition', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Reading', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Opinions', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United States', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'computerized', 'design', 'detector', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'radiologist']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R21,2007,194580,0,0.13129632690243842
"Information-Theoretic Based CAD in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The purpose of the study is to develop and evaluate a novel computer-assisted decision (CAD) scheme for improving the clinical detection of breast masses in screening mammograms. The CAD scheme combines information-theoretic similarity metrics with knowledge-based decision algorithms. It will help radiologists scrutinize mammograms providing evidence-based decision support. Given a query mammographic region, the CAD system will interrogate a database of archived mammograms, examine similar eases, and assign a likelihood measure regarding the presence of a potentially malignant mass.  The study proposes the formulation of information-theoretic metrics to quantify the similarity of two mammographic regions. The similarity metrics are based on Sharmon's entropy; a measure of complexity (or information) contained in an image. Theoretically, if two mammographic regions depict similar structures, they should contain diagnostic information for each other. The amount of relevant diagnostic information can be measured by entropy-based similarity metrics that are computed directly from the images without requiring segmentation or feature extraction. Using the similarity metrics and an image databank of mammographic cases with known truth, a knowledge-bussed CAD scheme will be implemented for the detection of masses in screening mammograms. Preliminary studies have established that standard mutual information (MI) is an effective similarity metric for the task.  The specific aims of the study are: (1) To fully exploit information-theoretic metrics that measure the similar content of two mammographic regions, (2) To optimize their contributions in an evidence-based decision algorithm for the early detection of potentially malignant masses, and (3) To perform preliminary clinical evaluation of the CAD system.  As digital image libraries are an upcoming trend in radiology, the proposed CAD system will take advantage of continuously deposited mammograms with established ground truth. The system aims to reduce the interpretation error associated with screening mammograms and/or the false positives generated by cuing CAD schemes, Overall, the study aims to improve the sensitivity while maintaining or improving the specificity of screening mammography for masses. n/a",Information-Theoretic Based CAD in Mammography,7162911,R01CA101911,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Interface', 'Cues', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Entropy', 'Image', 'Information Theory', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Base (Computer)', 'Libraries', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Metric', 'Physicians', 'Purpose', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Specificity', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'concept', 'digital imaging', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'statistics', 'trend']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,230712,607172798,0.1317704609159886
"Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal carcinoma is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. Bladder cancer is the fifth cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Often the cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage after the patients have developed symptoms, explaining their high mortality rates. Since most colon cancers arise from polyps over a 5 to 15 year period of malignant transformation, screening programs to detect small polyps less than 1 cm in diameter have been advocated. Unfortunately most people do not follow this recommendation. A similar situation exists for bladder tumor staging. The health relatedness of this project is to dramatically increase the number of people willing to participate in screening programs by offering a convenient, nearly risk-free procedure. Virtual colonoscopy (VCon) and virtual cystoscopy (VCys), as new procedures in which computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) images of the patient's abdomen are taken and a computer visualization system is used to virtually navigate within a constructed 3D model of the colon or bladder, has demonstrated the potential for colon cancer screening and bladder tumor evaluation. We have been contributing the VCon and VCys development for several years. The broad, long-term objective of this project is to develop 3D texture-based computer aided detection (txCAD) techniques to facilitate VCon and VCys as accurate, cost-effective, non-invasive, comfortable techniques to screen large segments of the population. The Phase I specific aims are: (1) To develop tissue-mixture image segmentation mitigating the partial volume effect. (2) To extract the mucosa layer and cleanse the lumen space of the hollow organs from the segmentation. (3) To identify suspicious patches in the mucosa layer with high sensitivity and reasonable false negatives. (4) To obtain the entire volume of each suspicious patch. The Phase II aims are: (5) To extract 3D geometrical, morphological and texture information from each suspicious volume. (6) To classify the extracted features using learning machine to eliminate false positives. (7) To evaluate the performance of the proposed txCAD on a patient database of over 200 cases. It is hypothesized that the proposed txCAD will significantly improve the detection performance compared to previous geometry-based CAD (sfCAD), and dramatically reduces the physician's interaction time with our developed VCon and VCys systems.           n/a",Texture-Based CAD for Cancer Screening from 3D Images,7196610,R21CA120917,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Digital Mammography', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fiber Optics', 'Genus Cola', 'Global Change', 'Health', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Device', 'Invaded', 'Invasive', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Thinking', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cost', 'day', 'density', 'desire', 'expectation', 'feeding', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tumor', 'vector', 'virtual']",NCI,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R21,2007,241745,77607041,0.05256058134866284

"A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of recurrent chromosomal aberrations is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of most hematological malignancies. Due to difficulties with culture of tumor cells, low mitotic index, poor chromosomal morphologies, and low prevalence, it takes tremendous effort and time for a cytogenetic clinician to obtain a sufficient number of analyzable metaphase cells under microscope before he/she can make an accurate clinical diagnosis. This process is not only very inefficient but also subject to human errors. In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of leukemia diagnosis, we propose to develop a computer aided chromosome imaging technique. Specifically, we will develop an innovative high-speed microscopic imaging system based on a time-delay-integration technique. The system can scan the entire sample-slide at high magnification to obtain high resolution digital images to reveal metaphase chromosomes as required by clinical diagnosis. We will also develop a novel computer aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme including four specific modules to (1) detect analyzable metaphase chromosome cells, (2) segment overlapped chromosomes, (3) identify and classify distorted chromosomes associated with cancer cells, and (4) predict the cancer prognosis. After identification and segmentation of analyzable chromosomes, we will compute and search for the effective and robust image features. Genetic algorithm will be used to train and optimize an artificial neural network and a Bayesian belief network for the classification and prediction tasks, respectively. Using the integrated CAD workstation, we will conduct an observer performance study to assess the performance of the technique and its clinical feasibility. In summary, the proposed imaging technique is highly efficient, and no or only minimal human interventions are required from initial slide-scanning up to the presentation of CAD results. With such a new computerized clinical tool, cytogeneticists can effectively focus their efforts on analyzing/verifying chromosomal abnormal patterns and making final diagnostic decisions. It is therefore expected that the proposed technology can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cancer (i.e., leukemia) diagnosis. The proposed technique has significant clinical potentials in monitoring therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment as well.          n/a",A computer aided chromosome imaging technique for cancer diagnosis,7261406,R01CA115320,"['Algorithms', 'Belief', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Congenital chromosomal disease', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytogenetics', 'Databases', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Graph', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Normal Cell', 'Numbers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Rate', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Skin', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'computerized', 'concept', 'day', 'design', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'size', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2007,309600,9101010,0.05562627889561765
"Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a new modality that holds the promise of improving mammographic sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, especially for dense breasts. The main goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided detection (CADd) system for breast masses in DTM, (2) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of malignant and benign masses in DTM, and (3) to evaluate the effects of CAD (either CADd or CADx) on radiologists' interpretation of DTMs. Previous CAD systems are developed for regular projection mammograms (PMs).The proposed CAD system makes use of the 3-dimensional (3D) information in DTM to improve mass detection and characterization. The innovations in the proposed project include: (1) development of new computer-vision techniques to exploit the 3D volumetric information in DTMs, (2) evaluation of the dependence of CAD performance on reconstruction algorithms, and (3) comparison of computerized mass detection and characterization in DTMs, projection view mammograms (PVs) (the non-reconstructed mammograms taken at multiple angles during tomosynthesis imaging), and PMs. We hypothesize that detection and characterization of masses on DTMs will be more accurate than corresponding tasks on regular PMs, and that the CAD systems can improve radiologists' accuracy. 3D breast phantoms with test objects will be designed and imaged with a prototype DTM system. The dependence of DTM image quality on reconstruction algorithms and their parameters, and on image acquisition techniques will be studied. The appropriate reconstruction techniques will be selected based on phantom and patient studies. A database of DTMs and corresponding PMs with malignant and benign masses and a set of normal cases will be collected with patient informed consent. CAD systems for detection and classification of masses will be developed. Two approaches will be compared: one uses the reconstructed DTM slices and the other uses the PVs as input to the CAD systems. For the DTMs, new techniques for 3D preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature classification will be designed. For the PVs, our previous techniques developed for regular PMs will be adapted to these low- dose images, and information fusion methods using techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines will be developed to merge the multiple-PV information. To test our hypotheses, we will compare the CAD system performances from these two approaches and that from the corresponding regular PMs, and conduct observer ROC studies to evaluate effects of the CAD systems on radiologists' performance. CAD will be an important tool that can help accelerate the implementation of DTM in clinical practice. DTM with CAD is expected to help fully utilize the potential of this new modality to improve breast cancer detection.           n/a",Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses,7498781,R33CA120234,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abbreviations', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Depth', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Mammography', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Informed Consent', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Mass in breast', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Slice', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'base', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R33,2007,389685,0,0.13742148602011936
"New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    In this project we hypothesize that a comprehensive clinical case library with intelligent agents can sort and render clinically similar cases and present clinically significant features, to assist the radiologist in interpreting mammograms. This computer library system is designed to integrate, search, and analyze clinical data that are analogous to the study case. In normal clinical practice, experienced radiologists often refer to their personal mental images of previous proven cases in making diagnoses and patient management decisions.  Providing a computerized library can refresh a radiologist's mental memory with a broad array of proven cases and concrete visualizations. The system can also assist less experienced radiologists in making diagnoses by referring them not only to histologically proven cases but also to the statistical distribution of features. Freed from bias induced by their recent experience, radiologists can use such a library system to improve the diagnostic accuracy at large. This approach differs greatly from conventional computer-aided detection (CAD) or computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) methods. One can also expect that by adding the radiologist's guidance - for example BI-RADS descriptors - into the proposed mammographic library system will lead to increase the searching accuracy and achieve a greater diagnostic outcome.  Technically speaking, this project differs from previous mammographic CADx and image-based retrieval methods in its emphasis on using local vector features and sector fuzzy features of the mammographic masses supported by our newly-invented maximum likelihood fuzzy shadow techniques and multiple circular path convolution neural network. In addition, the recent technical advances in image retrieval using the fuzzy feature matching method and hyper-space analysis techniques have made the success of the proposed approach highly possible.  This computer-based library system can be extended to include other imaging modalities for breast care.  It is conceivable that this comprehensive breast care database can further link local breast care centers through the coming high-speed network system. In addition, this system could also serve as a learning center for clinicians and scientists. This project represents a significant trend in the development of a comprehensive image data system for breast care in the next several decades.            n/a",New Century Breast Cancer Diagnostics System,7497321,R33CA102960,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Back', 'Ballistics', 'Benign', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digital Mammography', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Face', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Information Systems', 'Intelligence', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Maryland', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Other Imaging Modalities', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Printing', 'Psyche structure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Rate', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Security', 'Shadowing (Histology)', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'Subcategory', 'Supervision', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Teleradiology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Tissues', 'Today', 'Training', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'breast lesion', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'concept', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'experience', 'gun control laws', 'improved', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'member', 'next generation', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'trend', 'vector']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R33,2007,560186,50343425,-0.03008482399108192
"Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on interpretation of DMs. Previous CAD methods for lesion (mass and microcalcification) detection and characterization have been designed for digitized film mammograms and have generally been based on image features extracted from a single view. Our proposed approach is distinctly different from the previous approaches in that image information from two-view mammograms and bilateral mammograms will be fused using machine intelligence techniques. This fundamental change will expand the amount of information utilized in CAD and is expected to improve lesion detection and characterization. New computer vision techniques will be specifically designed for FFDM in order to exploit the advantages offered by digital detectors. This will produce a CAD system that is integrated with and takes full advantage of the latest imaging technologies to further improve the health care of women. We hypothesize that these advanced multiple-image information fusion techniques will lead to a more effective CAD system for FFDMs in comparison to a single-image approach, and that the CAD system will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy in the four most important areas of mammography: (i) detection of masses, (ii) classification of masses, (iii) detection of microcalcifications, and (iv) classification of microcalcifications. A database of digital mammograms (DMs) with malignant and benign lesions and a set of normal cases will be collected. We will first adapt our current film-based CAD algorithms to DMs in each of the four areas, taking into account the differences in the imaging characteristics between DMs and digitized mammograms. New computer vision techniques will then be developed to improve upon the current methods and to exploit the potential advantages of the high contrast sensitivity, high detective quantum efficiency, wide dynamic range, and the linear response to x-ray intensity of digital detectors. Novel regional registration methods for identifying corresponding lesions on CC and MLO views and for comparing the density symmetry on bilateral mammograms will be developed. Innovative fuzzy classification schemes will be designed to fuse multiple-image information and one-view information to reduce false positives and to improve detection sensitivity. Multiple-view morphological and texture features of a lesion will be merged using neural networks or other statistical classifiers for characterization of malignant and benign lesions. To test the hypotheses, we will (1) compare the performance of the multiple-image fusion CAD algorithm for DMs in each area to that of the corresponding one-view algorithm, (2) compare the detection accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies, and (3) compare the classification accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. It is expected that this research will not only lead to an effective CAD system for FFDM, the multiple-image fusion approach and the new computer vision techniques will also advance CAD technology for mammography in general. n/a",Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can*,7215135,R01CA095153,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Budgets', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data Set', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Digital Mammography', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Film', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Localized', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Mammography', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Woman', 'base', 'computerized', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'quantum', 'radiologist', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R01,2007,580689,0,0.16785923480304069
"Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long term goal of the project is to develop an effective computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist radiologists in making diagnostic decisions in breast imaging. In this proposed project, we will concentrate on the characterization of masses using mammograms and ultrasound images. We propose a new approach to CAD based on a classifier that can simultaneously estimate the likelihood of malignancy for the mass and retrieve similar cases from a large library of cases with known diagnosis for the radiologist's references. The new CAD system thus combines the advantages of a rating-based and an image-retrieval- based CAD system. It will aid radiologists not only by the malignancy estimate but also by enhancing their similarity-based decision making process. We will also design a relevance feedback image retrieval system that allows the radiologist to interactively and efficiently retrieve similar cases from a large data set as a tool to help develop the automated CAD system. We hypothesize that the reference images will increase the characterization accuracy of less experienced readers for masses, and that the computerized classification and image retrieval system to be developed in this study will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) collect a database of sonograms and mammograms containing masses; (2) extract features for mass characterization; (3) develop decision tree and k-nearest neighbor classifiers, compare decision tree training with and without boosting, and investigate methods for the retrieval of similar cases based on the developed classifiers; (4) develop a relevance feedback image retrieval method; (5) compare the performances of less experienced radiologists without and with aid by reference images retrieved by experienced radiologists; and (6) compare radiologists' performances without and with the fully-automated classification and image-retrieval CAD system by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) study. If successfully developed, the CAD system may not only reduce benign biopsies, but also reduce the variation in interpretation between experienced and less experienced radiologists. The relevance of this project to public health is that 70-85% of breast biopsies are performed for benign lesions. Any reduction in this number without a decrease in breast cancer detection sensitivity will decrease health care costs, as well as contribute to the well-being of the patient by reducing anxiety and morbidity.           n/a",Multimodality CAD system with image references for breast mass characterization,7147093,R21CA118305,"['classification', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'diagnosis', 'experience', 'health science profession', 'information systems', 'mammary gland', 'performance', 'radiology', 'ultrasonography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2006,162252,641965656,0.11697000648524467
"Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Digital tomosynthesis mammography (DTM) is a new modality that holds the promise of improving mammographic sensitivity of breast cancer detection and diagnosis, especially for dense breasts. The main goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided detection (CADd) system for breast masses in DTM, (2) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system for classification of malignant and benign masses in DTM, and (3) to evaluate the effects of CAD (either CADd or CADx) on radiologists' interpretation of DTMs. Previous CAD systems are developed for regular projection mammograms (PMs).The proposed CAD system makes use of the 3-dimensional (3D) information in DTM to improve mass detection and characterization. The innovations in the proposed project include: (1) development of new computer-vision techniques to exploit the 3D volumetric information in DTMs, (2) evaluation of the dependence of CAD performance on reconstruction algorithms, and (3) comparison of computerized mass detection and characterization in DTMs, projection view mammograms (PVs) (the non-reconstructed mammograms taken at multiple angles during tomosynthesis imaging), and PMs. We hypothesize that detection and characterization of masses on DTMs will be more accurate than corresponding tasks on regular PMs, and that the CAD systems can improve radiologists' accuracy. 3D breast phantoms with test objects will be designed and imaged with a prototype DTM system. The dependence of DTM image quality on reconstruction algorithms and their parameters, and on image acquisition techniques will be studied. The appropriate reconstruction techniques will be selected based on phantom and patient studies. A database of DTMs and corresponding PMs with malignant and benign masses and a set of normal cases will be collected with patient informed consent. CAD systems for detection and classification of masses will be developed. Two approaches will be compared: one uses the reconstructed DTM slices and the other uses the PVs as input to the CAD systems. For the DTMs, new techniques for 3D preprocessing, image segmentation, feature extraction, and feature classification will be designed. For the PVs, our previous techniques developed for regular PMs will be adapted to these low- dose images, and information fusion methods using techniques such as neural networks or support vector machines will be developed to merge the multiple-PV information. To test our hypotheses, we will compare the CAD system performances from these two approaches and that from the corresponding regular PMs, and conduct observer ROC studies to evaluate effects of the CAD systems on radiologists' performance. CAD will be an important tool that can help accelerate the implementation of DTM in clinical practice. DTM with CAD is expected to help fully utilize the potential of this new modality to improve breast cancer detection.           n/a",Digital Tomosynthesis Mammography: Computer-Aided Analysis of Masses,7080103,R21CA120234,"['classification', 'clinical research', 'computers', 'diagnosis', 'health science profession', 'information systems', 'mammary gland', 'mammography', 'performance', 'radiology', 'vision']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2006,215772,641965656,0.13742148602011936
"Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of death in the United States if untreated. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can dramatically reduce the mortality rate and morbidity of the disease. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has been reported to be an effective means for clinical diagnosis of PE. Interpretation of a CT scan for PE demands extensive reading efforts from a radiologist who has to visually track a large number of vessels in the lungs to detect suspected PEs. Despite the efforts, the sensitivities were reported to range from 53% to 100%. Preliminary results from the PIOPED II study indicated a sensitivity of 83% by multi-detector CTPA. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to improving the sensitivity and efficiency of PE detection in CTPA images, as well as reducing inter-observer variability. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop a robust CAD system that can provide a systematic screening of PE on CTPA scans and serve as a second opinion by automatically alerting the radiologists to suspicious locations on 2D slice and 3D volume rendering display of the CTPA images. We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to enhance the characteristics of vessels, automatically extract the pulmonary vessels, reconstruct the vessel tree, detect candidate PEs, differentiate PE from normal pulmonary structures, and identify the true PEs. The techniques will be specifically designed for analysis of the complex vascular structures on CTPA images. The specific aims of this project include: (1) developing image preprocessing method to enhance vessel characteristics, (2) developing a new rolling balloon technique in combination with structure analysis to track vessels accurately, including vessels partially or completely occluded by PEs, (3) developing multi-prescreening method for the identification of suspicious PEs at different levels of artery branches, especially for PEs in small subsegmental arteries, (4) analyzing PE features for development of classification methods, (5) developing false positive reduction method based on feature analysis and fuzzy rule-based, linear, or neural network classifiers, (6) exploring performance evaluation methodology for computerized detection of PEs, and (7) performing observer ROC study to evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' accuracy in PE diagnosis. The relevance of this research to public health lies in the fact that there is substantial false-negative diagnosis of PEs. CAD will potentially reduce missed PEs and improve the chance of timely treatment of patients, thus reducing the mortality rate and speed up recovery from this condition.         n/a",Computer-Aided Detection of Pulmonary Embolism on CT Pulmonary Angiography,7015959,R21EB005851,"['angiography', 'artery', 'classification', 'computers', 'diagnosis', 'health science profession', 'information systems', 'performance', 'radiology', 'vision']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2006,217615,641965656,0.13129632690243842
"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.

We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images.

A database of digital mammograms (DMs) with malignant and benign lesions and a set of normal cases will be collected. We will first adapt our current film-based CAD algorithms to DMs in each of the four areas, taking into account the differences in the imaging characteristics between DMs and digitized mammograms. New computer vision techniques will then be developed to improve upon the current methods and to exploit the potential advantages of the high contrast sensitivity, high detective quantum efficiency, wide dynamic range, and the linear response to x-ray intensity of digital detectors. Novel regional registration methods for identifying corresponding lesions on CC and MLO views and for comparing the density symmetry on bilateral mammograms will be developed. Innovative fuzzy classification schemes will be designed to fuse multiple-image information and one-view information to reduce false positives and to improve detection sensitivity. Multiple-view morphological and texture features of a lesion will be merged using neural networks or other statistical classifiers for characterization of malignant and benign lesions. To test the hypotheses, we will (1) compare the performance of the multiple-image fusion CAD algorithm for DMs in each area to that of the corresponding one-view algorithm, (2) compare the detection accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies, and (3) compare the classification accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. It is expected that this research will not only lead to an effective CAD system for FFDM, the multiple-image fusion approach and the new computer vision techniques will also advance CAD technology for mammography in general. n/a",Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can*,6903375,R01CA095153,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasms', 'calcification', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'digital imaging', 'human data', 'information systems', 'mammography', 'mathematics', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplastic growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2005,519009,641965656,0.16785923480304069
"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.                                                                                              The goal of the proposed project is to develop a CAD system for early detection      of lung cancers on thoracic helical CT images. We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed to          develop computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes for detection and                    characterization of pulmonary nodules in digital chest images. For development       of reliable and predictable CAD schemes, they proposed to establish a large          database with 2,000 cases of chest radiographs, which include 1,000 nodule           cases and 1,000 non-nodule cases, in collaboration with Richard M. Slone, M.D.,      Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, under a consortium       arrangement. An advanced CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules will be            developed by incorporating three subtraction techniques--temporal subtraction,       contralateral subtraction and energy subtraction--in order to achieve, on            average, a high sensitivity of 80-90% with a low false positive rate of              approximately 0.5 per chest image. They would investigate the usefulness of the      temporal subtraction technique in increasing the detection of subtle nodules         overlapped with ribs and also decreasing the number of false positives due to        rib-crossings, when a previous chest image of the same patient is available.         Contralateral subtraction, which is a novel technique for removal of peripheral      ribs in a single PA chest image, will be examined for enhancement in the             detection of overlapped nodules and reduction in the number of false positives.      They would also investigate the usefulness of energy subtraction soft-tissue         image for improved computerized detection of lung nodules in combination with        conventional chest images. In addition to the detection task, they would to          develop CAD schemes for characterization of nodules in order to distinguish          between benign and malignant nodules. This characterization task is to provide       the likelihood of malignance of lung nodules based on quantitative analysis of       image features of nodules detected by computer and/or by radiologists. With the      high level of detection performance that they expect to achieve, they propose        to develop a prototype CAD workstation and carry out a pilot study to examine        the clinical usefulness of CAD schemes on detection and characterization of          pulmonary nodules.                                                                                                                                                        n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY,6719070,R01CA062625,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'digital imaging', 'disease /disorder classification', 'human data', 'image processing', 'information systems', 'lung neoplasms', 'neoplasm /cancer radiodiagnosis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2004,397291,246330700,0.12030964805840783
"Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on interpretation of DMs. Previous CAD methods for lesion (mass and microcalcification) detection and characterization have been designed for digitized film mammograms and have generally been based on image features extracted from a single view. Our proposed approach is distinctly different from the previous approaches in that image information from two-view mammograms and bilateral mammograms will be fused using machine intelligence techniques. This fundamental change will expand the amount of information utilized in CAD and is expected to improve lesion detection and characterization. New computer vision techniques will be specifically designed for FFDM in order to exploit the advantages offered by digital detectors. This will produce a CAD system that is integrated with and takes full advantage of the latest imaging technologies to further improve the health care of women.

"Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid The objective of this project is to perform the initial development and evaluation of a computer aid to assist radiologists in their interpretation of mammograms. We will develop and evaluate an approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD(, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated. We will model the perceptual similarity between two lesion images as a non-linear function of those images, and use algorithms (support vector machines and artificial neural networks) to learn this function from similarity techniques that will allow the radiologist to refine the search by indicating preferences among the retrieved images, providing a capability similar to that present in text-search engines. We will focus only on the retrieval of images of microcalcification clusters (MCCs) to determine the feasibility of later developing a more-complete system capable of handling multiple lesion classes. The project will involve a thorough performance evaluation to determine the merits of continued development of the proposed approach to CAD. We will perform statistical analyses of inter-observer and intra-observer notions of image similarity, and use modern statistical resampling procedures to evaluate the generation error of our nonlinear similarity model. The specific aims of the proposed project are as follows: 1) Develop support-vector-machine and artificial-neural network methods for predicting radiologists' similarity assessments from image features extracted by computer; 2) Develop relevance-feedback techniques for refining searches based on user-assessed relevance of retrieved images; 3) Based on an MCC data set, obtain radiologists' similarity assessments, for training and testing the proposed image-retrieval system; and 4) Evaluate retrieval performance by using quantitative measures, such as precision-recall curves and generalization error, and studies of inter-observer and intra-observer variability; study diagnostic utility by measuring the fraction of retrieved images that share th same pathology as the query.  n/a",Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid,6621877,R21CA089668,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasms', ' calcification', ' calcium disorder', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' mammography']",NCI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2003,147213,8894636,0.06397585807123797
"Estimating Neural Network Precision for Cancer Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This application's broad, long-term             objective is to diagnose cancer accurately, reducing both false-negative and         false-positive diagnoses. The research proposed in this application concerns         artificial neural networks (ANNs) which are important statistical tools that         are used frequently in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods intended to            improve cancer diagnosis. The goal of this research is to provide error bars         for ANN output. The significance and health-relatedness of this research is          that the goal, if achieved, could represent a fundamental advance to ANNs in         CAD applications, by making ANN output more reliable for subsequent computer         processing and more intuitive to understand for radiologists to interpret and        incorporate (the diagnostic predictions made by ANNs) in their own diagnoses.        The proposed method could become the standard of practice, replacing the             conventional, one-ANN approach. The hypothesis to be tested is that artificial       neural network output has finite uncertainty which can be estimated and              expressed in terms of confidence intervals. The specific aims are:                                                                                                        (1) To demonstrate qualitatively the concept of uncertainty in ANN output and        the feasibility of developing multiple ANNs from a single set of training            cases.                                                                                                                                                                    (2) To develop and validate quantitative method(s) of ANN-precision estimation.                                                                                           (3) To apply ANN-precision estimation to a real-world CAD problem: computer          classification of malignant and benign clustered microcalcifications.                                                                                                     The research design is to use primarily computer simulations to investigate          properties of the output from multiple ANNs obtained from the same training          cases and to develop and validate practical method(s) for computing confidence       intervals in ANN output from these multiple ANNs, then to apply the new methods      to a real-world CAD task.

With the      high level of detection performance that they expect to achieve, they propose        to develop a prototype CAD workstation and carry out a pilot study to examine        the clinical usefulness of CAD schemes on detection and characterization of          pulmonary nodules.                                                                                                                                                        n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY,6633169,R01CA062625,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human data', ' image processing', ' information systems', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer radiodiagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2003,388688,246330700,0.12030964805840783
"Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The major goals of the proposed research are (1) to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for full field digital mammography (FFDM) using advanced computer vision techniques and (2) to evaluate the effects of CAD on interpretation of DMs. Previous CAD methods for lesion (mass and microcalcification) detection and characterization have been designed for digitized film mammograms and have generally been based on image features extracted from a single view. Our proposed approach is distinctly different from the previous approaches in that image information from two-view mammograms and bilateral mammograms will be fused using machine intelligence techniques. This fundamental change will expand the amount of information utilized in CAD and is expected to improve lesion detection and characterization. New computer vision techniques will be specifically designed for FFDM in order to exploit the advantages offered by digital detectors. This will produce a CAD system that is integrated with and takes full advantage of the latest imaging technologies to further improve the health care of women. We hypothesize that these advanced multiple-image information fusion techniques will lead to a more effective CAD system for FFDMs in comparison to a single-image approach, and that the CAD system will significantly improve radiologists' accuracy in the four most important areas of mammography: (i) detection of masses, (ii) classification of masses, (iii) detection of microcalcifications, and (iv) classification of microcalcifications. A database of digital mammograms (DMs) with malignant and benign lesions and a set of normal cases will be collected. We will first adapt our current film-based CAD algorithms to DMs in each of the four areas, taking into account the differences in the imaging characteristics between DMs and digitized mammograms. New computer vision techniques will then be developed to improve upon the current methods and to exploit the potential advantages of the high contrast sensitivity, high detective quantum efficiency, wide dynamic range, and the linear response to x-ray intensity of digital detectors. Novel regional registration methods for identifying corresponding lesions on CC and MLO views and for comparing the density symmetry on bilateral mammograms will be developed. Innovative fuzzy classification schemes will be designed to fuse multiple-image information and one-view information to reduce false positives and to improve detection sensitivity. Multiple-view morphological and texture features of a lesion will be merged using neural networks or other statistical classifiers for characterization of malignant and benign lesions. To test the hypotheses, we will (1) compare the performance of the multiple-image fusion CAD algorithm for DMs in each area to that of the corresponding one-view algorithm, (2) compare the detection accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies, and (3) compare the classification accuracy of masses and microcalcifications on DMs with and without CAD by observer ROC studies. It is expected that this research will not only lead to an effective CAD system for FFDM, the multiple-image fusion approach and the new computer vision techniques will also advance CAD technology for mammography in general. n/a",Digital Mammography: Advanced Computer-Aided Breast Can*,6574171,R01CA095153,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasms', ' calcification', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' information systems', ' mammography', ' mathematics', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplastic growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2003,482072,641965656,0.16785923480304069
"Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid The objective of this project is to perform the initial development and evaluation of a computer aid to assist radiologists in their interpretation of mammograms. We will develop and evaluate an approach to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD(, in which the radiologist will be assisted by a content-based search engine that will display examples of lesions, with known pathology, that are similar to the lesion being evaluated. We will model the perceptual similarity between two lesion images as a non-linear function of those images, and use algorithms (support vector machines and artificial neural networks) to learn this function from similarity techniques that will allow the radiologist to refine the search by indicating preferences among the retrieved images, providing a capability similar to that present in text-search engines. We will focus only on the retrieval of images of microcalcification clusters (MCCs) to determine the feasibility of later developing a more-complete system capable of handling multiple lesion classes. The project will involve a thorough performance evaluation to determine the merits of continued development of the proposed approach to CAD. We will perform statistical analyses of inter-observer and intra-observer notions of image similarity, and use modern statistical resampling procedures to evaluate the generation error of our nonlinear similarity model. The specific aims of the proposed project are as follows: 1) Develop support-vector-machine and artificial-neural network methods for predicting radiologists' similarity assessments from image features extracted by computer; 2) Develop relevance-feedback techniques for refining searches based on user-assessed relevance of retrieved images; 3) Based on an MCC data set, obtain radiologists' similarity assessments, for training and testing the proposed image-retrieval system; and 4) Evaluate retrieval performance by using quantitative measures, such as precision-recall curves and generalization error, and studies of inter-observer and intra-observer variability; study diagnostic utility by measuring the fraction of retrieved images that share th same pathology as the query.  n/a",Content based mammogram retrieval as a diagnostic aid,6437170,R21CA089668,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasms', ' calcification', ' calcium disorder', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human data', ' information retrieval', ' mammography']",NCI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2002,143782,8894636,0.06397585807123797
"COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): An essential factor in lung         cancer survival is early detection, with up to 50% long term survival among          patients whose tumors are detected at clinical stage I. Unfortunately, only 15%      of lung cancers are currently detected at this stage. A major problem in early       detection is the limitation of chest radiography, the initial procedure for          detection of pulmonary nodules; it is estimated that 30% of positive nodules         are currently missed. Therefore, the applicants proposed to develop an advanced      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme that assists radiologists in detecting         pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs by providing them with a ""second              opinion."" The main obstacle to achieving a clinically acceptable level of            performance in such schemes is the large number of false-positive detections.        Thus, this proposal focuses on improving the performance of pulmonary nodule         detection by substantially reducing the number of false positives detected. The      specific aims are: (1) To establish image databases of pulmonary nodules for         development and evaluation of a CAD scheme by (a)extracting regions of interest      containing nodule candidates from an existing database, and (b) developing a         new database of digital chest images for evaluation of the CAD schemes; (2) To       develop methods for removal of normal anatomic structures by implementing            radiologists' visual analysis strategy that (a) identify regions with similar        normal anatomic structures in the lung, and (b) remove anatomic structures           through non-linear registration and subtraction; (3) To develop methods to           select and combine image features for reduction of false positives by (a)            extracting image features characteristic of nodules from                             normal-structure-subtracted regions, (b) by applying adaptive rule-based tests,      (c) combining features by artificial neural networks to obtain a single index        for the reduction of false positives, and (d) using genetic algorithms to            select features that are most effective in distinguishing nodules from false         positives; and (4) To evaluate the benefit of the overall CAD scheme by (a)          performing observer studies to estimate improvement of radiologists' diagnostic      accuracy in the detection of pulmonary nodules without and with computer aid,        and (b) performing pilot prospective studies for preclinical evaluation. The         hypothesis is that a CAD scheme with a clinically acceptable sensitivity and         specificity will substantially improve radiologists' accuracy in the detection       of pulmonary nodules. Such a high-performance CAD scheme should advance the          early detection of pulmonary nodules, and therefore has the potential to             improve the prognosis for patients.                                                                                                                                       n/a",COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES,6514433,R01CA085668,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cancer information system', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2002,169875,246330700,0.12302157891285571
"Estimating Neural Network Precision for Cancer Diagnosis   DESCRIPTION (Provided by Applicant): This application's broad, long-term             objective is to diagnose cancer accurately, reducing both false-negative and         false-positive diagnoses. The research proposed in this application concerns         artificial neural networks (ANNs) which are important statistical tools that         are used frequently in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods intended to            improve cancer diagnosis. The goal of this research is to provide error bars         for ANN output. The significance and health-relatedness of this research is          that the goal, if achieved, could represent a fundamental advance to ANNs in         CAD applications, by making ANN output more reliable for subsequent computer         processing and more intuitive to understand for radiologists to interpret and        incorporate (the diagnostic predictions made by ANNs) in their own diagnoses.        The proposed method could become the standard of practice, replacing the             conventional, one-ANN approach. The hypothesis to be tested is that artificial       neural network output has finite uncertainty which can be estimated and              expressed in terms of confidence intervals. The specific aims are:                                                                                                        (1) To demonstrate qualitatively the concept of uncertainty in ANN output and        the feasibility of developing multiple ANNs from a single set of training            cases.                                                                                                                                                                    (2) To develop and validate quantitative method(s) of ANN-precision estimation.                                                                                           (3) To apply ANN-precision estimation to a real-world CAD problem: computer          classification of malignant and benign clustered microcalcifications.                                                                                                     The research design is to use primarily computer simulations to investigate          properties of the output from multiple ANNs obtained from the same training          cases and to develop and validate practical method(s) for computing confidence       intervals in ANN output from these multiple ANNs, then to apply the new methods      to a real-world CAD task. The methods to be used include computer simulation,        ROC analysis, computation of confidence intervals, bootstrapping, parametric         estimation of statistical distributions, analytical analysis, and computer           analysis of breast lesions in mammograms.                                                                                                                                 n/a",Estimating Neural Network Precision for Cancer Diagnosis,6422575,R21CA093989,"['artificial intelligence', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' calcification', ' calcium disorder', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' female', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', "" women's health""]",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2002,182408,246330700,0.08718753048481394
"Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer      deaths in both men and women. A 70 percent five-year survival rate has been          reported when the lung cancer is diagnosed at a local stage, compared to 2           percent when distant metastases are found. Recent studies indicate that helical      CT may be an effective screening tool for lung cancer. The American College of       Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) will begin a randomized controlled trial of        helical CT for lung cancer screening to evaluate its efficacy. Analysis of CT        images to detect lung nodules is a demanding task for radiologists. Some lung        nodules will likely be overlooked because of the overwhelming amount of              information to be interpreted. Characterization of detected nodules to reduce        unnecessary biopsies will also become more important as the number of thoracic       CT exams increases. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) can be a viable approach to       improving the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer detection in CT images. It      will be particularly useful if lung cancer screening with CT is implemented.                                                                                              The goal of the proposed project is to develop a CAD system for early detection      of lung cancers on thoracic helical CT images. We hypothesize that an accurate       CAD system (1) can be developed, (2) can be used as a second opinion to assist       radiologists in interpretation of thoracic CT exams, and (3) will improve            radiologists' accuracy for lung cancer detection.                                                                                                                         We will develop advanced computer vision techniques to automatically segment         helical CT images, detect candidate pulmonary nodules, differentiate nodule and      normal pulmonary structures, and estimate the likelihood of malignancy of the        nodules. Computerized image segmentation and feature extraction techniques will      be developed based on expert knowledge and image characteristics. Statistical        classifiers, fuzzy classifiers, and artificial neural networks will be designed      to differentiate nodules and normal structures, as well as to characterize           malignant and benign nodules. Quantitative CT phantom studies will be performed      to develop reliable methods for estimating the calcium concentration of nodules      and estimating nodule volume on CT images so that these features can be used in      our CAD system for malignancy detection. Observer performance studies using          receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology will be conducted to             evaluate the effects of CAD on radiologists' detection and classification of         lung nodules in CT images. A large public database of helical CT cases to be         collected by an NIH-supported consortium will be the main data source for the        development of the computer vision techniques. The innovations of this project       include: (1) developing region-specific computer vision method for detection of      lung nodules; (2) eliminating the vascular tree in the helium for false              positive reduction, (3) exploring interval change analysis for classification        of malignant and benign nodules; (4) developing a quantitative method for            measuring the calcium concentration of nodules for improved characterization of      calcified nodules, and (5) performing ROC studies to evaluate CAD's ability to       assist radiologists in the detection and characterization of lung nodules in CT      studies. It is expected that the proposed studies will result in an effective        CAD system for lung cancer diagnosis. When fully developed and clinically            implemented, a CAD system for lung nodules will increase the efficacy of lung        cancer screening with helical CT, improve early detection, and improve the           chance of survival of patients.                                                                                                                                           n/a",Computer Aided Diagnosis of Lung Cancer,6418479,R01CA093517,"['calcification', ' calcium', ' calcium disorder', ' clinical research', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2002,360102,641965656,0.14980249847646313
"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed to          develop computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes for detection and                    characterization of pulmonary nodules in digital chest images. For development       of reliable and predictable CAD schemes, they proposed to establish a large          database with 2,000 cases of chest radiographs, which include 1,000 nodule           cases and 1,000 non-nodule cases, in collaboration with Richard M. Slone, M.D.,      Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, under a consortium       arrangement. An advanced CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules will be            developed by incorporating three subtraction techniques--temporal subtraction,       contralateral subtraction and energy subtraction--in order to achieve, on            average, a high sensitivity of 80-90% with a low false positive rate of              approximately 0.5 per chest image. They would investigate the usefulness of the      temporal subtraction technique in increasing the detection of subtle nodules         overlapped with ribs and also decreasing the number of false positives due to        rib-crossings, when a previous chest image of the same patient is available.         Contralateral subtraction, which is a novel technique for removal of peripheral      ribs in a single PA chest image, will be examined for enhancement in the             detection of overlapped nodules and reduction in the number of false positives.      They would also investigate the usefulness of energy subtraction soft-tissue         image for improved computerized detection of lung nodules in combination with        conventional chest images. In addition to the detection task, they would to          develop CAD schemes for characterization of nodules in order to distinguish          between benign and malignant nodules.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED CHEST RADIOGRAPH READER The long term objective of this phase is to provide a means for reducing inter- and intra- reader variability in diagnosing interstitial lung diseases in chest radiographs through a computer-based system for analyzing digital images. The Computer-assisted Chest Radiograph Reader System (CARRS) applies recognized principles in the psychophysics of human vision, incorporates neural network-based image analysis and integrates these with a graphical user interface. Advances in digital image processing, and classification techniques have made CARRS feasible for meeting screening, research arid development, and clinical requirements. CARRS will implement the International Labor Organization (ILO) classification procedures. The specific aims of this project are to implement enhancements to  the CARRS prototype developed in Phase I and to validate the advanced version with several hundred chest radiographs.

"KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IN DISTRIBUTED CARDIAC IMAGE BASES DESCRIPTION (taken from application abstract):  Heart disease continues          to be the primary cause of death in the U.S., with 25% of all deaths             related to coronary artery disease (CAD). In addition to the loss of             irreplaceable human life, there are also staggering health care costs            and losses in productivity associated with the 1.5 million myocardial            infarctions suffered in the U.S. every year.  The present competing              renewal application seeks to make a contribution toward this vital               health care problem by exploring frontier computing methods to support           and facilitate CAD assessment.  The objective of the proposed research           is to develop and evaluate a methodology to accomplish the following             specific aims:                                                                                                                                                    (1)Knowledge Discovery: To design, implement and test novel database             (DB) ""mining"" algorithms to uncover associations and inferences imbedded         in clinical DBs and which can improve diagnostic performance.                    (2)Knowledge Base Enrichment: To use the knowledge resulting from DB             mining as well as conventional knowledge-acquisition methods to create           and evaluate a robust knowledge base (KB) with which to interpret                cardiovascular SPECT imagery and other types of relevant, patient-               specific information.                                                            (3)Distributed Knowledge Discovery and Processing:  To extend both the           Knowledge-discovery and knowledge-based processing methods to                    distributed, Internet-based setting for a twofold purpose: (I) to                provide users with widespread access to the resulting KB, and (ii) to            access and mine remote multi center DBs to further improve our knowledge         regarding the assessment of CAD.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): The applicants proposed to          develop computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) schemes for detection and                    characterization of pulmonary nodules in digital chest images. For development       of reliable and predictable CAD schemes, they proposed to establish a large          database with 2,000 cases of chest radiographs, which include 1,000 nodule           cases and 1,000 non-nodule cases, in collaboration with Richard M. Slone, M.D.,      Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University, under a consortium       arrangement. An advanced CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules will be            developed by incorporating three subtraction techniques--temporal subtraction,       contralateral subtraction and energy subtraction--in order to achieve, on            average, a high sensitivity of 80-90% with a low false positive rate of              approximately 0.5 per chest image. They would investigate the usefulness of the      temporal subtraction technique in increasing the detection of subtle nodules         overlapped with ribs and also decreasing the number of false positives due to        rib-crossings, when a previous chest image of the same patient is available.         Contralateral subtraction, which is a novel technique for removal of peripheral      ribs in a single PA chest image, will be examined for enhancement in the             detection of overlapped nodules and reduction in the number of false positives.      They would also investigate the usefulness of energy subtraction soft-tissue         image for improved computerized detection of lung nodules in combination with        conventional chest images. In addition to the detection task, they would to          develop CAD schemes for characterization of nodules in order to distinguish          between benign and malignant nodules. This characterization task is to provide       the likelihood of malignance of lung nodules based on quantitative analysis of       image features of nodules detected by computer and/or by radiologists. With the      high level of detection performance that they expect to achieve, they propose        to develop a prototype CAD workstation and carry out a pilot study to examine        the clinical usefulness of CAD schemes on detection and characterization of          pulmonary nodules.                                                                                                                                                        n/a",COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS IN CHEST RADIOGRAPHY,6362584,R01CA062625,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' disease /disorder classification', ' human data', ' image processing', ' information systems', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer radiodiagnosis', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2001,373412,246330700,0.12030964805840783
"IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the         United States today.  In an effort to reduce mortality, Congress                 recently included a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to              support screening colonoscopy as a means for early detection and removal         of colorectal polyps, the precursors to cancer.  In this country alone,          more than 68 million people are eligible for colorectal screening, but           the majority are unlikely to comply with screening recommendations               because of the costs, risks, discomfort, and inconvenience associated            with traditional endoscopy.  Furthermore, even if a small fraction of            eligible persons are examined, the number of available                           gastroenterologists would be insufficient to perform so many procedures.                                                                                          We have developed a new technique, called virtual colonoscopy (VC), as           an alternative to screening diagnostic colonoscopy (DC). The procedure           consists of cleansing a patient's colon, inflating the colon with air,           scanning the abdomen with helical computed tomography (CT), and                  generating a rapid sequence of three-dimensional (3D) images of the              colon by means of virtual reality computer technology.  Although VC              makes possible the visualization of 3D images of the colon in a manner           similar to that of DC, a correct diagnosis depends upon a physician's            ability to identify small and sometimes subtle polyps within hundreds            of 3D images.  The absence of visual cues that normally occur with DC            makes VC interpretation tedious and susceptible to error.                                                                                                         With support from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we have             developed a computer-assisted polyp detection (CAPD) system that                 calculates areas of abnormal colon wall thickness in helical CT image            data in order to highlight potential polyps in the 3D images.  A                 physician ultimately determines if each detected lesion represents a             true abnormality.  Although we have found CAPD to be sensitive for               finding subtle abnormalities, poor specificity can be attributed to              several obstacles, including imprecise image segmentation, limited               feature analysis, and suboptimal bowel preparation prior to helical CT           scanning.  With these challenges in mind, we propose research to perfect         CAPD. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To develop an image                   segmentation algorithm that accurately isolates the colon from helical           CT image data; 2. To improve our polyp detection algorithm with expanded         feature analysis and artificial intelligence methods; 3. To optimize             bowel preparation with digital subtraction of opacified feces and                controlled gas distention; and 4. To validate the accuracy of VC, with           the modifications achieved in the stated aims, by comparing the results          of VC and DC in 200 patients undergoing usual-care colonoscopy.                                                                                                   If VC with CAPD proves accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of                colorectal polyps, it could evolve into a simple laboratory test,                thereby meeting the demand for worldwide colorectal cancer screening.             n/a",IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION,6376842,R01CA078485,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' colon neoplasms', ' colon polyp', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' endoscopy', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human subject', ' image enhancement', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,607399,2966077,0.017559002910983203
"COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): An essential factor in lung         cancer survival is early detection, with up to 50% long term survival among          patients whose tumors are detected at clinical stage I. Unfortunately, only 15%      of lung cancers are currently detected at this stage. A major problem in early       detection is the limitation of chest radiography, the initial procedure for          detection of pulmonary nodules; it is estimated that 30% of positive nodules         are currently missed. Therefore, the applicants proposed to develop an advanced      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme that assists radiologists in detecting         pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs by providing them with a ""second              opinion."" The main obstacle to achieving a clinically acceptable level of            performance in such schemes is the large number of false-positive detections.        Thus, this proposal focuses on improving the performance of pulmonary nodule         detection by substantially reducing the number of false positives detected. The      specific aims are: (1) To establish image databases of pulmonary nodules for         development and evaluation of a CAD scheme by (a)extracting regions of interest      containing nodule candidates from an existing database, and (b) developing a         new database of digital chest images for evaluation of the CAD schemes; (2) To       develop methods for removal of normal anatomic structures by implementing            radiologists' visual analysis strategy that (a) identify regions with similar        normal anatomic structures in the lung, and (b) remove anatomic structures           through non-linear registration and subtraction; (3) To develop methods to           select and combine image features for reduction of false positives by (a)            extracting image features characteristic of nodules from                             normal-structure-subtracted regions, (b) by applying adaptive rule-based tests,      (c) combining features by artificial neural networks to obtain a single index        for the reduction of false positives, and (d) using genetic algorithms to            select features that are most effective in distinguishing nodules from false         positives; and (4) To evaluate the benefit of the overall CAD scheme by (a)          performing observer studies to estimate improvement of radiologists' diagnostic      accuracy in the detection of pulmonary nodules without and with computer aid,        and (b) performing pilot prospective studies for preclinical evaluation. The         hypothesis is that a CAD scheme with a clinically acceptable sensitivity and         specificity will substantially improve radiologists' accuracy in the detection       of pulmonary nodules. Such a high-performance CAD scheme should advance the          early detection of pulmonary nodules, and therefore has the potential to             improve the prognosis for patients.                                                                                                                                       n/a",COMPUTERIZED DETECTION OF PULMONARY NODULES,6088420,R01CA085668,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' cancer information system', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' human data', ' image processing', ' lung neoplasms', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' thoracic radiography']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2000,169875,246330700,0.12302157891285571

The proposed CAD schemes will aid          radiologists in screening mammograms for suspicious lesions and provide          estimate of the likelihood of malignancy for the detected lesions. The           information is expected to reduce the miss rate and to improve the               positive predictive value of the mammographic findings.                                                                                                           A data base of clinical mammograms which include malignant and benign            microcalcifications and masses will be established. Physical measures            which characterize the significant image features of the lesions will be         developed. Based on these measures, linear discriminant classifiers or           neural network classifiers will be optimized using a genetic algorithm           approach to classify true and false signals and to estimate the likelihood       of malignancy for each type of lesions.                                                                                                                           For automated detection and classification of microcalcifications, we will       investigate the usefulness of multiresolution analysis for enhancement of        the signal-to-noise ratio of the microcalcifications and for improvement         of feature extraction techniques. Physical characteristics such as size,         shape, frequency spectrum, spatial distribution, clustering properties,          and texture features will be extracted and analyzed with the classifiers.                                                                                         For automated detection and classification of masses, we will improve the        background correction and signal segmentation techniques, and develop            effective false-positive reduction methods. Adaptive filtering, edge             enhancement, and clustering segmentation methods will be developed for           extraction of the mass margins. Physical characteristics such as size,           density, edge sharpness, calcifications, shape, lobulation, spiculation,         and multiresolution wavelet texture features will be extracted from the          masses and analyzed with the classifiers.                                                                                                                         The algorithms will be implemented in a dedicated CAD workstation and            preclinical testing will be conducted. The performance of the programs in        a clinical setting will be assessed. The algorithms will be revised and          improved based on the information obtained with the preclinical testing.         The study is a vital step for the development of a clinically reliable CAD       scheme.                                                                                                                                                           Observer performance studies using receiver operating characteristic (ROC)       methodology will be conducted to evaluate the effects of the CAD schemes         on radiologists'performance.                                                      n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER BASED TECHNIQUES IN MAMMOGRAPHY,6164055,R01CA048129,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' breast neoplasms', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' diagnosis quality /standard', ' digital imaging', ' image processing', ' mammography', ' mathematical model']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN,R01,2000,452383,0,0.14238242307983898
"IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the         United States today.  In an effort to reduce mortality, Congress                 recently included a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to              support screening colonoscopy as a means for early detection and removal         of colorectal polyps, the precursors to cancer.  In this country alone,          more than 68 million people are eligible for colorectal screening, but           the majority are unlikely to comply with screening recommendations               because of the costs, risks, discomfort, and inconvenience associated            with traditional endoscopy.  Furthermore, even if a small fraction of            eligible persons are examined, the number of available                           gastroenterologists would be insufficient to perform so many procedures.                                                                                          We have developed a new technique, called virtual colonoscopy (VC), as           an alternative to screening diagnostic colonoscopy (DC). The procedure           consists of cleansing a patient's colon, inflating the colon with air,           scanning the abdomen with helical computed tomography (CT), and                  generating a rapid sequence of three-dimensional (3D) images of the              colon by means of virtual reality computer technology.  Although VC              makes possible the visualization of 3D images of the colon in a manner           similar to that of DC, a correct diagnosis depends upon a physician's            ability to identify small and sometimes subtle polyps within hundreds            of 3D images.  The absence of visual cues that normally occur with DC            makes VC interpretation tedious and susceptible to error.                                                                                                         With support from a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant, we have             developed a computer-assisted polyp detection (CAPD) system that                 calculates areas of abnormal colon wall thickness in helical CT image            data in order to highlight potential polyps in the 3D images.  A                 physician ultimately determines if each detected lesion represents a             true abnormality.  Although we have found CAPD to be sensitive for               finding subtle abnormalities, poor specificity can be attributed to              several obstacles, including imprecise image segmentation, limited               feature analysis, and suboptimal bowel preparation prior to helical CT           scanning.  With these challenges in mind, we propose research to perfect         CAPD. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. To develop an image                   segmentation algorithm that accurately isolates the colon from helical           CT image data; 2. To improve our polyp detection algorithm with expanded         feature analysis and artificial intelligence methods; 3. To optimize             bowel preparation with digital subtraction of opacified feces and                controlled gas distention; and 4. To validate the accuracy of VC, with           the modifications achieved in the stated aims, by comparing the results          of VC and DC in 200 patients undergoing usual-care colonoscopy.                                                                                                   If VC with CAPD proves accurate and efficient in the diagnosis of                colorectal polyps, it could evolve into a simple laboratory test,                thereby meeting the demand for worldwide colorectal cancer screening.             n/a",IMPROVING VIRTUAL COLONOSCOPY WITH COMPUTER DETECTION,6173999,R01CA078485,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' colon neoplasms', ' colon polyp', ' computed axial tomography', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer simulation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' endoscopy', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human subject', ' image enhancement', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis']",NCI,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R01,2000,563099,2966077,0.017559002910983203
