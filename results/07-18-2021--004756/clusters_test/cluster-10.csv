"VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS Abstract Contemporary fluorescence microscopy connects our understanding of molecular events from biochemistry and structural biology with their activities in living cells. Lattice light sheet microscopy (LLSM) has made it possible for us to track phenomena such as endocytic vesicle assembly or lipid kinase recruitment across an entire cell with high resolution, in both space and time, and with nearly single-molecule sensitivity. Development during the past year of lattice light sheet microscopy with adaptive optics (AO-LLSM) has overcome the optical limitations that have so far restricted most studies to individual cells in culture, allowing us to achieve comparable resolution and sensitivity in the complex optical environment of an intact, living, multicellular organism. It promises to bridge the gap between cells and organisms, through high sensitivity, volumetric imaging, with diffraction-limited resolution, of living tissues and developing embryos. We propose a research program in three overlapping stages: implementation of AO-LLSM (in collaboration with its developer), development of the new kinds of visualization and analysis software required by the scale and complexity of the datasets, and use of AO-LLSM to solve a problem in vertebrate development. To meet the computational challenges of analyzing the 4D data sets (from low signal-to-noise, the often non- punctate characteristics of the objects being studied, the temporally varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets), we will develop new approaches using deep learning and related algorithms, with consultation from experts. As a paradigm application, we will study the consequences of Notch signaling and the related membrane-traffic and protein translocation events for cell differentiation in zebrafish early neurogenesis. AO-LLSM will for the first time allow us to relate molecular signaling events occurring on a timescale of seconds at cell interfaces to the ultimate fate of daughter cells many hours later. We therefore expect that in the course of resolving some long- standing issues in cell fate determination, we will develop microscopy approaches and computer visualization tools that are widely applicable to a range of model systems and biological questions. Narrative We will implement and apply a novel, live-cell imaging strategy (Lattice Light-Sheet Microscopy with Adaptive Optics: AO-LLSM) that spans, with diffraction-limited resolution, a range from molecules to tissues and from seconds to hours. We will use this new technology to study cell differentiation in the embryonic zebrafish brain, concentrating on how Notch-mediated signaling exerts long-range control over neuronal development. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive models of the underlying biology will require that we devise new and generalizable ways to display and analyze complex data sets, while overcoming the computational challenges posed by the low SNR of the imaging regime, the time-varying spatial complexity of the data, and the size of the data sets.",VISUALIZATION OF SUBCELLULAR DYNAMICS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS,10136020,R35GM130386,"['Algorithms', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Endocytic Vesicle', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Protein Traffic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Protein translocation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Zebrafish', 'adaptive optics', 'complex data', 'daughter cell', 'deep learning', 'live cell imaging', 'neurogenesis', 'neuron development', 'new technology', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'recruit', 'single molecule', 'structural biology']",NIGMS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R35,2021,442500
"Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a novel spectroscopic cellular assay that will enable us to measure the real-time intra-cellular response of a cell to various extra-cellular stimuli. The uniqueness of our approach relies on several innovations. We will construct an Inverted Spectral Infrared Microscope (ISIM) based on Fourier- transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and combining it with a novel biosensor based on plasmonic nanostructures (metasurfaces). The biosensor will be integrated with multi-well plates to enable high- throughput. The proposed assay will detect biochemical and morphological changes of the cell, with the emphasis on the reorganization of the cellular membrane and its cytoskeleton. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve its sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays. To our knowledge, this will be the first real-time cellular assay that satisfies all of the four requirements below: (i) high throughput, (ii) multi-dimensionality of the collected time-dependent data, (iii) specific focus on biochemical changes of the cell, and (iv) focus on the changes occurring in close proximity of the cellular membrane. The assay will be validated using very common external stimuli of the cell, such as small-molecule compounds acting on G-protein coupled receptors. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to develop a novel multi-dimensional real-time cell assay. This will be accomplished by constructing an FTIR-based inverted spectral infrared microscope (ISIM) and combining it with a novel biosensor. The biosensor is based on the integration of plasmonic metasurface fabricated on an infrared-transparent glass with multi-well microtiter plates. The proposed geometry will enable high throughput while the metasurface will dramatically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the penetration depth of the infrared light into the cell. These innovations will enable us to quantify the effects of extra-cellular signaling on the excitation of intra-cellular signaling pathways. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve the sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays.",Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays,10218929,R21GM138947,"['Adherence', 'Adhesions', 'Agonist', 'Apoptosis', 'Bar Codes', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Testing', 'Biosensor', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Matrix Junction', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Concentration measurement', 'Coupled', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Ensure', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fingerprint', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Fourier Transform', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Go Alpha Subunit', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nanostructures', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stimulus', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trypsin', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Water', 'absorption', 'base', 'biological systems', 'data standards', 'design', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'light transmission', 'novel', 'plasmonics', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'sensor', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'temporal measurement', 'tomography', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,233752
"Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics Membrane receptors play a crucial role in many physiological processes throughout the body by mediating communication between cells. Single molecule imaging has been used extensively to study membrane receptor assembly and stoichiometry in vitro using isolated protein and to a lesser extent cell culture. While studies in isolated cellular systems provide insight into many processes, they lack the context of the complex environment present in an animal where communication between cell types residing in tissue is critical for receptor activity. Single- molecule imaging of native proteins synthesized in vivo would provide a direct approach to measure processes, such as receptor dimerization, that regulate physiological activity. However, current methods are not capable of applying single molecule techniques to study the regulation of protein dynamics taking place within the complex environment of an animal. We have made recent advances in the development of ex vivo single molecule techniques to monitor changes in protein assembly that occur within specific organs. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate ex vivo single molecule tools that provide new capabilities to monitor the properties of oligomeric membrane receptor assembly, resolve cell type and subcellular region specific single membrane receptors, and automate single molecule data analysis using a machine learning platform. This novel ex vivo technology will enable researchers to take a snap shot in time of the membrane receptor dynamics that took place in the mouse and monitor changes in membrane receptor assembly in response to changes in the animal's physiological environment such as disease and exposure to therapeutics. Membrane receptors are important therapeutic targets for many diseases and are expressed throughout the body. Understanding the role of receptor assembly in the complex environment of a live animal is an important step in understanding their mechanism of activation and regulation. We will develop ex vivo single-molecule methods that for the first time will enable quantitative studies of stoichiometry for receptors extracted from mice.",Ex vivo single molecule tools to analyze membrane receptor dynamics,10207891,R01GM138837,"['Address', 'Animal Communication', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vesicle', 'alpha-SNAP', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'molecular imaging', 'nanoscale', 'nanovesicle', 'novel', 'open source', 'postsynaptic neurons', 'presynaptic', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'response', 'sex', 'single molecule', 'stoichiometry', 'technique development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue preparation', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,299122
"Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data Many projects have characterized the human brain transcriptome within and across cell types to better understand changes in RNA expression associated with brain development and aging, developmental or psychiatric brain disorders, and genetic variation. Large consortia, including psychENCODE, CommonMind and BrainSeq Consortiums, have primarily focused on the molecular profiling of RNA extracted from homogenate/bulk tissue from different brain regions across thousands of individuals. However, bulk tissue like the frontal cortex contains a mixture of different important cell populations, and failing to account for the underlying composition of tissue samples can cause both false positives and missed signal in differential expression analysis. Therefore, statistical methods referred to as ""cellular deconvolution"" have been developed that estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in bulk RNA-seq datasets. These cell fractions can then be used to control for differences in cell composition across bulk tissue samples and can better determine the cell type(s) that drive differential expression signal in bulk tissue data. However, these approaches require reference expression profiles from the underlying cell types that will be estimated, which can be difficult to generate from human postmortem brain tissue. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) or single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) datasets to construct these reference profiles and perform cellular deconvolution, particularly in peripheral tissues. While many statistical or machine learning approaches have been proposed, the majority produce similar composition estimates for a given reference dataset. However, as we describe in this application, many of these existing reference datasets -regardless of the algorithm employed - are largely non- comparable to the vast majority of bulk RNA sequencing data generated from postmortem human brain tissue, and have produced incorrect estimates of cellular composition. Current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. We therefore propose to generate a more comprehensive framework for performing cellular deconvolution in human postmortem RNA- seq data.This proposal will leverage the extensive bulk RNA sequencing performed over the past decade to better determine the relative role of cell type-specific expression in the human brain and their subsequent dysregulation in debilitating brain disorders. Recent approaches have leveraged single cell or nuclei RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to perform cellular deconvolution on homogenate datasets, but many current algorithms estimate the relative fraction of RNA attributable to each cell type, and not the relative fraction of cell types. This proposal therefore aims to develop novel reference and validation datasets necessary to implement cellular, and not RNA, deconvolution from RNA-seq datasets, which will become publicly available software. We will lastly apply this novel deconvolution approach to thousands of homogenate RNA-seq samples to identify cell type-specific insights into debilitating brain disorders.",Integrative cellular deconvolution of human brain RNA sequencing data,10138028,R01MH123183,"['Accounting', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Autopsy', 'Bioconductor', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nuclear', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'differential expression', 'excitatory neuron', 'frontal lobe', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'oligodendrocyte precursor', 'secondary analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical learning', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web app']",NIMH,"LIEBER INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,507442
"Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development Project Summary Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived organoids hold great promise for tissue engineering and personalized drug screening, but obtaining the desired multicellular organization and function from these systems is usually performed in an ad hoc fashion without forward design specification. Recently, we reported successful liver bud formation containing stromal cells, vascular tube-like structures and hematopoiesis-like processes by synthetically inducing diversity in GATA6 expression from a single hiPSC population. This accomplishment suggests that expanding circuit logic operations to artificially control differentiation drivers at particular bifurcations in lineage specification could profoundly impact the complexity and functionality of organoids. In this project, we bring together mathematical modeling, machine learning, optimization, and innovative synthetic biology techniques to elucidate and design fundamental decision and communication rules for guiding cells into complex, heterogeneous tissues. Our overarching hypothesis is that appropriate timing and predictable stochastic control of the expression of intracellular and extracellular factors is critical for redirecting lineage choices in order to elicit desired multicellular organization from a population of differentiating cells. We will develop synthetic tools for sensing differentiation stages of iPSC-derived organoids and construct and characterize a stochastic commitment switch in an inducible reporter system. These tools will be integrated in synthetic gene circuits for engineering emergent multicellular organization through stochastic temporal control of developmental factors. The modular commitment switches developed in this project will be capable of exploring how the degree of subpopulation biasing of cell fate decisions and level of cell fate synchronization at bipotent differentiation stages impacts self-assembly and emergent multicellular organization of an organoid. Our aims - executed through a closed loop of computational and experimental investigations - will shed insight on how generalizable methods of controlled manipulation can elicit desired organoid-level emergent properties. We will combine synthetic biology and advanced computational techniques to accelerate an ongoing revolution — the application of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to regenerative and personalized medicine. We will integrate new genetic circuits into hiPSCs that sense changes in endogenous gene expression and activate expression of other genes in order to redirect organoid differentiation to desired outcomes with specific 3D organization and arrangements of cell types and functions. Our design of sophisticated gene regulatory networks will be based on advanced optimization techniques rooted in control theory and machine learning, enabling precise and predictable generation of desired 3D structures and organoid functions.",Synthetic gene sensors and effectors to redirect organoid development,10155771,R01EB030946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cadherins', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Drug Screening', 'Endoderm', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Growth Factor', 'Guide RNA', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Mesoderm', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Switch Genes', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Visual', 'base', 'cell type', 'computing resources', 'control theory', 'design', 'engineering design', 'extracellular', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision drugs', 'programs', 'self assembly', 'self organization', 'sensor', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell population', 'synthetic biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,682610
"Deep tensor genomic imputation Project Summary/Abstract High-throughput sequencing assays allow scientists to measure biochemical properties like transcription factor binding, histone modiﬁcations, and gene expression in nearly any cell line or primary tissue (“biosample”). Unfortunately, measuring all possible biochemical properties in every biosample is infeasible, both because of limited sample availability and because the cost would be prohibitive. We have previously developed a state-of- the-art imputation method, called Avocado, that can ﬁll in the holes in such data sets. Avocado couples tensor factorization with a deep neural network. The method is scalable to large data sets and provides more accurate imputations than competing methods such as ChromImpute or PREDICTD. We have already applied Avocado systematically to the NIH ENCODE data set and made the imputations publicly available via the ENCODE web por tal.  Here, we propose to extend Avocado in four important ways. First, we will extend Avocado to handle single-cell data sets, thereby effectively turning each single-cell experiment into an in silico co-assay that measures multiple properties of each cell in parallel. Second, we will extend Avocado to work with data such as Hi-C, which measures three-dimensional properties of DNA. The extension involves converting Avocado's 3D tensor (biosample assay  genomic position) to a 4D tensor with two genomic position axes. This extension will apply to a wide variety of data types, including various types of Hi-C data, SPRITE, GAM, ChIA-PET and PLAC-seq. Third, we will enhance Avocado to use variant aware genomic sequence to enable high-resolution imputation of regulatory proﬁles. Finally, we will leverage the imputed data to infer cis-regulatory sequence annotations and the molecular impact of regulatory non-coding variants in one of the most comprehensive collections of cellular contexts.  All of the software produced by this project will be open source, and all of the imputed data and latent factorizations will be made publicly available via the web portals associated with the NIH 4D Nucleome and ENCODE Consortia, providing a valuable public resource for users of these data sets. Project narrative High-throughput sequencing can be used to measure many types of biochemical activity along the genome in a huge variety of primary cell types and cell lines (“biosamples”), but it is prohibitively expensive to measure all possible types of activity in all possible biosamples. Accordingly, we have developed a powerful machine learning approach to predict such measurements before they are performed. Here, we propose to increase Avocado's utility by extending the method to work with single-cell data types, to work with 3D genome architecture data, to incorporate information about DNA sequence and to decode regulatory DNA sequence and non-coding genetic variation.",Deep tensor genomic imputation,10096947,R01HG011466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Avocado', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hi-C', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'cost', 'data standards', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'in silico', 'large datasets', 'next generation', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'syntax', 'transcription factor', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,398567
"Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models Gene regulation is an important determinant of the complex specialization of cells in the human brain, and nucleotide changes within regulatory elements contribute to risk for psychiatric disorders. We therefore hypothesize that these debilitating diseases are driven in part by genetic variants that alter gene expression and disturb the balance and function of cell types in brain tissue. Single-cell open chromatin assays are a promising approach to testing this hypothesis by mapping variants to regulatory elements specific to and shared across cell populations. There are two major barriers to this strategy, for which our project proposes modeling solutions. First, despite being the best assay currently, single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) suffers from low resolution, meaning that an open chromatin region may be supported by zero or few reads in a given cell. This makes it hard to identify coherent cell populations. We propose a network model for semi-supervised clustering of cells in scATAC-seq that leverages information from higher-coverage bulk tissue experiments and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), if available. The expected outcomes from applying this model to compendia of brain data from public repositories and our collaborators are (i) identification of open chromatin regions that differentiate cell types and states, and (ii) discovery of resolved cell populations whose open chromatin is enriched for psychiatric disorder associated genetic variants. These results alone may not be enough to develop a mechanistic understanding of how variants impact brain function. To address this second challenge, we will implement a computationally efficient, machine-learning framework for predicting the specific regulatory functions of single-cell open chromatin regions from our network model and other approaches. Gene regulatory enhancers are particularly amenable to this approach, because high-throughput mouse transgenics and massively parallel reporter assays have generated enough validated enhancers for supervised learning. Our framework will be easy to apply to other regulatory functions, such as insulating boundaries in chromatin capture data. By developing a compressed, yet flexible, featurization of massive bulk and single-cell data compendia, we will enable rapid iteration with computationally intensive prediction algorithms to be applied to single-cell open chromatin regions. Our approach will also incorporate transfer learning from data-rich (e.g., postmortem or mouse brains) to data-poor settings (e.g., human late-gestation brains). We expect predicted regulatory elements to be more enriched for psychiatric disorder genetic risk, to provide mechanistic insight regarding how variants cause disease, and to be useful molecular tools. Together our two proposed computational approaches will leverage the complementary strengths of bulk and single-cell data to resolve regulatory elements that drive the exquisite diversity of cells in developing and adult brains towards mapping the non-coding contribution of psychiatric disease. The human brain is a complex tissue comprised of diverse cell types with distinct gene regulation and function, making it difficult to mechanistically link genetic mutations to differences in brain health. This project will develop a network model and machine-learning framework that leverage single-cell and bulk genomics data to identify genome sequences that control gene expression in specific cell populations and states. We hypothesize that these cell type resolved regulatory elements will shed light on how sequence variants outside protein-coding genes increase risk for psychiatric disorders.",Resolving single-cell brain regulatory elements with bulk data supervised models,10144503,R01MH123178,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Censuses', 'Chickens', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'XCL1 gene', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'egg', 'epigenomics', 'equilibration disorder', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'gene function', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multiple data types', 'network models', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'promoter', 'psychiatric genomics', 'public repository', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'web server', 'whole genome']",NIMH,J.

"Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) such as kidney fibrosis are global health challenges. In the US alone CKD cost Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis, but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1, and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis. Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1 also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles, effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments. Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment. Kidney fibrosis is global health challenge with no effective treatment currently. Our proposed research will examine how two fibrosis contributing processes, cell cycle arrest and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are coupled. The research will lay foundation for developing novel dynamic strategies to treat kidney fibrosis through rescuing cells from cell cycle arrest.",Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development,10062964,R01DK119232,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'G2/M Arrest', 'Genes', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'M cell', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubular formation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging study', 'kidney epithelial cell', 'kidney fibrosis', 'live cell imaging', 'loss of function', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'renal epithelium', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,341955
"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the biological principles of neuronal cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function and disorders. We will develop and apply supervised machine learning – based algorithms to the analysis of the rapidly accumulating single cell molecular genetics data sets across the mammalian species from the BRAIN Initiative.

"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis. Building a model of relapse risk prediction based on the presence of these cells will enable rapid, accurate, and actionable relapse prediction moving closer to the goal of preventing relapse.",Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,10210902,R01CA251858,"['Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Automobile Driving', 'B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biology', 'CREB1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SYK gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'exome sequencing', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,615576
"Quantitative protein network profiling to improve CAR design and efficacy PROJECT SUMMARY This grant is in response to PAR-18-206, Bioengineering Research Grants (BRG). Our goal is to adapt a cutting-edge proteomic network analysis platform, Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation or QMI, to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell signaling. We will then use CAR-QMI to characterize signal transduction network activation downstream of the CAR, to both understand how the CAR instructs a T cell to attack and destroy cancerous targets, and to make batch-specific predictions about efficacy and side-effect profiles of CAR T cell products. CAR T cells are a breakthrough anti-cancer therapy that recently won FDA approval for relapsed B cell lymphomas. A true “personalized medicine”, CAR T cells are manufactured for each patient from that patient's own T cells by transducing T cells collected by leukopheresis with a viral vector encoding a CAR. However, since each batch is unique, some batches perform better than others in terms of producing remissions and/or deleterious and sometimes fatal side effects including cytokine storms and neurotoxicity. The goal of this project is to develop a “personalized signal transduction network analysis platform” that can screen each batch of CAR T cells and predict the efficacy and side-effect potential of that specific batch. Because signal transduction networks integrate information from multiple input sources- for example costimulatory and immunosuppressive cell surface receptors, patient genetic background, and T-cell specific history of activation- we hypothesize that this readout will be a powerful predictor of function. Our preliminary data show that small changes in CAR design parameters such as scFV binding domain affinity produce measurable changes in signal transduction network state that correlate with functional variables such as target killing ability and cytokine release. Further, we show that there exists considerable individual-to- individual variation in batches of CAR T cells produced from different donors. Therefore, the two prerequisites for an individualized predictive assay are present- variation in our measurement across the population, and the functional relevance of our measurement to outcome parameters. Our interdisciplinary team consists of experts in CAR development, signal transduction, proteomics, and bioinformatics. Our ambitious but achievable goals are to expand the QMI panel to include CAR-specific components; to understand how CAR design parameters influence both signal transduction network states and functional performance measures; and to develop a predictive machine learning algorithm that translates QMI-derived signal transduction network states into a functional biomarker of in vivo clinical efficacy. Successful completion these aims will (1) identify specific proteins or protein interactions that determine clinically-relevant outcomes such as cytokine production or cell killing ability, allowing CAR designers to rationally modify the design of CARs to target specific signaling outcomes; (2) provide clinicians with a test to predict the clinical performance of CAR T cells on a batch-to- batch basis; and (3) provide the community with a novel analytical platform to measure CAR activity. PROJECT NARRARATIVE CAR T cells have the potential to recognize and specifically kill cancer cells, making them the target of extensive anti-cancer drug development research. This proposal will use a novel technology for monitoring the activation state of a T cell, a protein-interaction-network based approach called Quantitative Multiplex co-Immunoprecipitation, or QMI. Our goal is to identify a protein interaction network state indicative of clinical performance, and to better understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for CAR T cell efficacy.",Quantitative protein network profiling to improve CAR design and efficacy,10144946,R01CA240985,"['Affinity', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'CD19 gene', 'CD22 gene', 'CD28 gene', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Co-Immunoprecipitations', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fc Receptor', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'ITAM', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'K-562', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biosignature', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'cell killing', 'cell type', 'cellular transduction', 'chimeric antigen receptor', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computer infrastructure', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'leukemia', 'lymphoblast', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular modeling', 'nano-string', 'neurochemistry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'research and development', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'transcriptome']",NCI,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,504231
"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors.

"Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions Cell migration in 3D tissue space is of fundamental importance for human biology. However, predicting and programming 3D cell motility remain as major challenges despite of a firm picture of the molecular machineries involved. To fill the knowledge gap between the overwhelming subcellular details such as protein-protein interactions, and the fascinating dynamic patterns exhibited by different cell types in tissue spaces, I will focus on the mesoscale cellular dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions of cells in 3D extracellular matrix (ECM). My lab has developed deep-learning based image postprocessing to track the migration modes of cells. We also developed techniques to manipulate and measure the micromechanics of ECM at cellular scale. Based on these preliminary results, I will systematically study the intrinsic and extrinsic control mechanisms of 3D cell migration mode transitions in collagen ECM. The results will pave the way for my long-term goals to understand the organizing principle that lead molecules to life, and to program cell motility for applications in tissue engineering and cancer treatment. To this end, I will dedicate my lab to the following research thrusts. Thrust 1 aims to determine how cell migration mode transitions are regulated by external cues, as well as intrinsic states of cells during the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). I will test three hypotheses that elucidate the roles of ECM micromechanical stiffness, anisotropy, plasticity, synergy of mechanical and chemical guidance, as well as EMT stage in modulating the cell migration mode transitions. I will employ sophisticated ECM engineering and characterization techniques developed in my lab. I will also use genetically engineered cells whose EMT transcription factors are fluorescent labeled and can be specifically activated. Completion of thrust 1 will establish 3D cell migration as a hidden Markov process where the mesoscale dynamics, namely the migration mode transitions, provides a unifying framework to explain diverse dynamic patterns of 3D cell migration observed in vivo. Thrust 2 aims to devise strategies to program cell migration via nonstationary mechanical cues. In subproject 1, I will employ techniques developed in my lab to control 3D contact guidance cues in space and in real time. By measuring the migration mode transitions under step-increasing contact guidance, I will obtain the energy barriers that separate different modes. Then under periodic mechanical stimuli I will measure and computationally model the nonequilibrium mode transition flux, a statistical physics quantity that inform the efficiency and energy dissipation of cell motility responses. These mesoscale quantities shed light to the underlying molecular organizing principles. In subproject 2 I will develop collagen ECM which exhibits digital response to stresses using DNA-grafted nanoparticles as crosslinkers. I will design the DNA sequence to control the yield strength of crosslinkers, thereby programing cell migration mode both for single cell and for collective organoid migration. Completion of thrust 2 will expands the design space of engineered ECM, laying a foundation for the mechanical programing of 3D cell motility. 3D cell migration is of fundamental importance for both normal physiological processes such as in development, and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. Understanding the regulation and control mechanisms not only will advance our basic understanding of how cells mechanically interact with their environment, but will also lead to powerful strategies to facilitate therapeutic strategies in areas such as tissue regeneration, immune disorder and cancer.",Understanding the control mechanisms of 3D cell migration from new dimensions,10197977,R35GM138179,"['3-Dimensional', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collagen', 'Computer Models', 'Crosslinker', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Markov Chains', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mesenchymal', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Physics', 'Physiological Processes', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'fascinate', 'genetically modified cells', 'in vivo', 'migration', 'nanoparticle', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'synergism', 'tissue regeneration', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,352506

"Mapping Single Extracellular Vesicles to Parent Cells for Immunotherapy Monitoring This proposal aims to develop an ultra-high sensitive platform that can map cell and extracellular vesicle (EV) molecular information at the single particle level, and apply it to proﬁle tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) for immunotherapy monitoring. This technology can resolve heterogeneity of biological systems and has the potential to discover robust biomarkers that can accurately proﬁle status of the body for disease diagnostics. This proposal hypothesizes that single cell-single EV mapping will provide new molecular information on cell-cell communication for better understanding of pathological development and disease diagnosis. The goals of this proposal are threefold: i) development of single EV protein sequencing technology to resolve EV heterogeneity and discover rare EV subtypes for disease biomarkers, ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed live cell ﬂuorescence imaging to monitor the changes of cellular phenotypes and identify multiple immune cell types, and iii) single cell-single EV mapping to discover new molecular information on cell-cell communication through vesicle secretion. This technology will allow repeat sampling and monitoring of TIME during the course of immunotherapy and provide guidance to achieve the best possible patient outcomes. With the expertise in microﬂuidics, molecular biology, and machine learning, Jina Ko (the PI of this proposal) has developed new micro- and nano-technologies for liquid biopsy that can extract multidimensional molecular data from blood-based biomarkers (e.g. circulating tumor cells, EV). She has extended her expertise to chemistry, droplet microﬂuidics, and translational medicine to develop novel platforms that will serve as a fundamental work to this proposal. She has recently developed i) ultra-high sensitive single EV proﬁling technology using droplet digital PCR and ii) ultra-fast cycling for multiplexed cellular ﬂuorescence imaging. Through this work, Jina has forged research collaborations within and outside the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School at the Wyss Institute and Harvard University. Building upon these achievements, this work will be executed with a team of world experts in droplet microﬂuidics and physics (Weitz), molecular imaging and diagnostics (Weissleder), immunology (Pittet), exosome biology and neurogenetics (Breakeﬁeld), and neurosurgery and oncology (Chiocca) who will provide a full support on this work. Working with these mentors will allow her to tackle clinically challenging problems and further develop her career as an independent investigator with the ability to develop next generation medical diagnostics.

"Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development Summary The pathways involved in embryonic development have been a rich resource for understanding disease in adults, as well as being critically important in tracing the effects of genetic lesions and environmental poisons in the fetus. Frog embryos have been particularly useful due to the large size of the frog egg and embryo. New tools we developed for measuring the expression of RNA at a single-cell level, and advances in protein and phosphopeptide measurement technologies, offer hope for dramatic progress in understanding how signals involved in the maturation of the embryo direct individual cells to adopt specific fates. Our first goal is to define cell types using single-cell transcriptomics, and to define the lineages that result in specific cell types using high resolution temporal mappings. Targeted transcriptomics and proteomics of important molecules involved in specifying cell fate, such as transcription factors, will provide an index of the levels of signaling activity in each individual cell. This will result in an unprecedentedly detailed molecular picture of the factors involved in producing the phenotypes, and their interconversions from the early cleavage stage to the middle of organogenesis. The Xenopus model system allows us to dissect out portions of the early embryo that differentiate to ectoderm if not disturbed, called the animal cap. In the context of the embryo the cells in the animal cap receive a number of developmental signals, including Nodal, BMP, and Wnt. Combinations of these three signals (in different proportions) are capable of generating many of the major tissues. We will expose animal caps to a matrix of these three signals and trace the differentiation pathways that result, using single-cell RNA sequencing. This study of the molecular roots of differentiation decisions will be used to develop a mathematical approach, based on machine learning, to predicting the results of an attempted perturbation of the development of Xenopus. We will ask whether cell types are carefully specified by tightly controlled combinations of ligands or whether there are default states that are hard to escape from (""basins of attraction""), that therefore form the majority of embryonic cell types. The answer to this question is central to our understanding of how the Xenopus embryo reliably develops into a frog, and will accelerate efforts to create computational methods to predict the behavior of other biological pathways such as those involved in cancer. Narrative The complexity of biology makes it hard to predict what effect a mutation or a drug will have. We will use new tools to measure when genes are expressed at the individual cell level throughout the course of development of a vertebrate embryo. This will give us new information on the cell types involved in tissue and organ formation, and will provide an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that we will use to develop a mathematical model of how the decision to become a specific cell type is made.",Systems Analysis of cell type differentiation in Xenopus development,10174971,R01HD073104,"['Activins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Animal Cap', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Nodal', 'Organ', 'Organogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plant Roots', 'Poison', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'RNA library', 'Rana', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrometry', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Xenopus', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'cell type', 'cluster computing', 'course development', 'egg', 'embryo cell', 'experimental study', 'hatching', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'notochord', 'novel', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'single cell proteins', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'vertebrate embryos', 'xenopus development']",NICHD,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,614763
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Death Inhibition', 'Cell fusion', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Ganglia', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhibition of Apoptosis', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroepithelial', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neuropil', 'New York', 'Optic Lobe', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Transcript', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'developmental neurobiology', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroblast', 'neuroepithelium', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinotopic', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'somatosensory', 'stem cell division', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-photon']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Project Summary  Organelle dynamics profoundly affect the physiology of the cell and are regulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton. Alterations in organelle dynamics (i.e., inter-organelle and cytoskeletal contacts, fission, and mobility) are associated with a variety of human diseases, particularly neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most commonly inherited neuropathy and is caused by mutations in at least eighty different genes. Although the mutations that cause CMT are often in genes linked to altered organelle dynamics, questions remain regarding the pathogenic mechanism. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the polymerization of actin at ER-mitochondria contact sites via the ER-anchored, actin polymerizing protein INF2. Dominant activating mutations in INF2 cause increased mitochondrial fission and excessive actin accumulation on mitochondria, which reduces mitochondrial mobility. Similar mutations in INF2 also cause CMT. Preliminary data show that 1) actin accumulates at fission sites of other organelles including endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and the Golgi, and 2) that CMT mutations in INF2 cause a reduction in endosome and lysosome mobility. This leads to the central hypothesis of this proposal: there is a conserved molecular mechanism regulating organelle fission and mobility mediated by actin cytoskeletal proteins at ER-organelle contact sites. Furthermore, it is proposed that reduction in organelle mobility specifically affects peripheral neurons due to the extreme length of these cells and hence may be a general pathogenic feature of CMT. The Specific Aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1 focuses on the role of INF2 in mitochondrial, endosomal, and lysosomal fission and how these processes are altered by mutations in INF2 that cause CMT. These studies will be carried out in primary human fibroblasts via live-cell imaging, including the use of a novel, innovative probe that specifically labels ER-associated actin. Experiments to assess organelle functions and to directly implicate actin polymerization in the phenotypes observed will also be performed. Aim 2 will be carried out in cultured primary mouse neurons in order to properly assess how alterations in organelle dynamics and mobility affect neuronal health. Deep learning-based image restoration will be used to achieve high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of organelle mobility. Aim 3 will include organelle and neuronal health assays in the context of disease-relevant models of CMT. Specifically, neurons derived from CMT patient fibroblasts and neurons from mice injected with AAVs directing expression of CMT- mutant INF2, MFN2, or RAB7A will be analyzed. Completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into the role of actin in organelle fission and mobility, how these processes are coupled, and test the novel hypothesis that CMT involves global disruption of mobility of multiple organelles. This will further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of CMT and perhaps other neurodegenerative disorders. The project will also enhance my scientific training by providing me with invaluable training in neurobiology and neurodegeneration, designing novel imaging probes, advanced imaging techniques, stem-cell based reprogramming, and mouse models. Project Narrative Alterations in organelles (e.g. mitochondria) are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Charcot- Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease; however, our understanding of how organelle dynamics are regulated is still not complete. While actin has a known role in ER-mediated mitochondrial fission through the activities of the actin- regulatory protein INF2, our preliminary results suggest a common mechanism at play in other organelles. This proposal focuses on ER- and actin-mediated organelle fission, how this process impacts organelle motility, and the consequences of CMT mutations that disrupt these processes in nerve cells in culture and in mice.",Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,10142253,F32GM137580,"['Actins', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Endosomes', 'Environment', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lysosomes', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'depolymerization', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'hereditary neuropathy', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging probe', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'nanobodies', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'peroxisome', 'polymerization', 'programs', 'restoration', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell technology', 'stem cells']",NIGMS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,F32,2021,66390
"Integrative single cell analyses of inflammation-derived circulating hybrid cells to identify aggressive disease PROJECT SUMMARY The lifetime risk for acquiring colorectal cancer (CRC) is 7%, with an astounding rate of disease recurrence in 32% of newly diagnosed patients after their “successful” treatment. Patient with recurrent disease have a dismal 14.3% five-year survival. Lack of effective biomarkers hampers early detection of pre-metastatic disease, impacting overall survival from CRC. We identified a promising disseminated tumor cell—a product of macrophage (MФ) and cancer cell fusion—that harbors genotypic and phenotypic features of both cells of origin. Detectable along the metastatic cascade, hybrid cells can initiate tumor growth, migrate in response to MФ receptor-ligand chemotaxis, and seed metastatic sites. In peripheral blood, hybrids, named circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) outnumber conventionally defined circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in CRC patients, overcoming the sensitivity of CTC—a primary barrier—to usage as a biomarker for disease. CHCs are phenotypically diverse and reflect protein expression of the primary tumor. Based on these exciting findings, we propose that hybrid cells subpopulations harbor discrete phenotypes of pre-metastatic cells that can be identified and defined using single cell image-based phenotyping through multiplexed imaging and multimodal integration with –omics. To this end, we will analyze CHCs derived from early stage and metastatic tumors for image-based phenotyping with single cell gene expression. Utilizing quantitative and advanced image analytics including deep learning approach for image-based cell profiling, we will define inter/subcellular spatial features in single cells to identify new subpopulations and differentiate discrete phenotypic populations associated with metastatic signatures. In addition, the application of both imaging and genomic technologies to the same specimen independently measures highly dimensional, yet non-orthogonal, sets of cellular features. Multimodal integration of imaging and single cell data will quantify systems-level biological functions of cellular subpopulation and enhance imaging biomarker panel to gain biomarker specificity and sensitivity for validation in a discrete CRC patient cohort. Our overall goal is to develop a novel tumor biomarker, based upon CHC phenotyping and –omics analyses that can be used to provide new quantitative insights and develop machine-driven prediction with superior accuracy for identifying risk of metastases in CRC patients to ultimately impact survival. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite advances in screening, colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death due to a high recurrence rate after initial treatment and a dismal 14.3% survival rate of patients with recurrent disease. Improving survival from colorectal cancer requires the ability to develop effective biomarkers for early detection of recurrent/pre-metastatic disease.

"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,10150484,R01MH120404,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical shape', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cortex mapping', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'neocortical', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'patch sequencing', 'preservation', 'scale up', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'ward']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,401250
"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury.

"Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiac valves are critical to the maintenance of unidirectional blood flow in the heart. Congenital and acquired valvulopathies are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both the pediatric and adult populations. Current therapeutic strategies are limited, often requiring surgical replacement with suboptimal prostheses. Valvulogenesis begins with formation of the endocardial cushions via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many of the signaling pathways regulating this EMT event have been defined; however, little is known about the molecular regulators of post-EMT valvulogenesis. Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect, is characterized by variably dysplastic, muscularized tricuspid valve leaflets that are often tethered to the underlying myocardium, resulting in apical displacement of the annulus and atrialization of the right ventricle. This defect is often attributed to a failure of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of post-EMT valvulogenesis during which the primordial valve leaflets separate from the underlying myocardium. Previous studies suggest that altered differentiation dynamics of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of this valvular defect. I propose to define the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via a multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly, leveraging an Ebstein’s Anomaly murine model system, primary human tissue, and human genetics data. In my first aim, I will use spatiotemporal single cell RNA sequencing and human genetics analyses to identify the atrioventricular cushion signaling interactions regulating valvular delamination. In my second aim, I will use an integrated single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing approach to define the gene regulatory networks driving VIC fate determination. My primary sponsor, Dr. Deepak Srivastava, has extensive expertise in developmental cardiac biology, human genetics, and stem cell biology. My co- sponsor, Dr. Chun (Jimmie) Ye, has an expertise in experimental and computational single cell genomics. Their collective expertise will assure that I receive the necessary training and mentorship to complete the proposed research. To obtain the rare tissue samples required for my project, I have formed a multi-center collaboration with two high volume Ebstein’s Anomaly patient centers. Additionally, I have secured expertise in human genetics and machine learning from Dr. Jingjing Li, Ph.D., in support of the human genetics component of my project. Concurrently, I am engaging in a longitudinal clinical preceptorship in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery with my clinical training co-sponsor, Dr. Peter Kouretas, Surgical Director of the UCSF Pediatric Heart Transplantation Program. Overall, the proposed research will elucidate previously uncharacterized mechanisms of late atrioventricular valvular morphogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative-medicine based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies. F30 NRSA fellowship support would foster my expertise in developmental cardiac biology and computational genomics, furthering me toward my ultimate career goal of becoming an academic pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The molecular regulators of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of valvulogenesis whose dysfunction underlies a rare tricuspid valve malformation, Ebstein’s Anomaly – remain largely unknown. I will apply an innovative multi-omic approach to identify the intercellular interactions regulating this morphogenetic process and define the gene regulatory networks that drive valvular interstitial cell fate determination. This study will deepen our understanding of valvulogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative medicine-based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies.",Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly,10233685,F30HL158170,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Apical', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyes', 'Ebstein&apos', 's Anomaly', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart Valves', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preceptorship', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tricuspid valve structure', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'XCL1 gene', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'career', 'epigenomics', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'genetic analysis', 'heart pharmacology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'interstitial cell', 'mRNA Expression', 'malformation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'periostin', 'programs', 'prospective', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F30,2021,37830
"Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape Project Summary/Abstract The candidate, Wenpin Hou, PhD, is an applied mathematician and computational biologist serving as a postdoctoral fellow of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH). Her long-term career goal is to improve clinical practice in therapy for diseases by developing computational and statistical methods to decipher spatial and temporal gene regulatory programs using multi-omics data and implementing these methods into developmental process and diseases. The research she proposes entitled Computational Methods for Inferring Single-cell DNA Methylation and its Spatial Landscape combines advanced spatial transcriptomics techniques with computational methods to infer spatial DNA methylation landscape, which enables the accurate evaluation of the epigenomic spatial variability and epigenomic targets in therapy for diseases. Dr. Hou completed her PhD in Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong where she focused on inferring and controlling gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Her ﬁrst postdoctoral research (2017-2019) with Drs. Aravinda Chakravarti and Suchi Saria at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) represented the ﬁrst shift in focus of GRNs from theoretical to computational genomics. Her second postdoctoral research (2019-present) with Drs. Hongkai Ji and Stephanie Hicks at JHSPH has further provided complementary training in reconstructing and predicting spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape using single-cell data. Dr. Hou's mentoring team consists of Hongkai Ji (primary mentor), PhD, an expert in developing computational and statistical tools for analyzing single-cell genomic data, including reconstructing and predicting temporal and spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic landscape; Stephanie Hicks (co-mentor), PhD, an expert in developing statistical methods to address technical variability and spatial transcriptomics in single cells; and Andrew Feinberg (co-mentor), PhD, one of the founders of the ﬁeld of cancer epigenetics who directs the ﬁrst NIH funded Epigenome Center. This offers the opportunity to tackle signiﬁcant challenges in the intersection of statistics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics with advanced experimental techniques. Her scientiﬁc advisors are Drs. Kasper Hansen, Gregory Hager and Xiaobin Wang who have leading expertise in computational epigenomics, deep learning, clinical translation and disease prevention, respectively. Leveraging the intellectual, experimental, and computing resources from all mentors and advisors as well as through JHSPH, JHU and Johns Hopkins Medicine, Dr. Hou will receive intensive training, mentoring and career development to achieve the goals proposed in this application and have productive outcomes during the award period. Aim 1 will develop methods to predict DNA methylation landscape using bulk gene expression. Aim 2 will develop methods to predict single-cell DNA methylation and differential DNA methylation. Aim 3 will reconstruct tissue-spatial DNA methylation landscape at the single-cell level, generate evaluation datasets in spatial context, and perform across-study assessments using data from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), Human Cell Atlas, and Recount2. Project Narrative Genomic and epigenomic abnormalities collaborate in disease initiation and progression, as exempliﬁed by frequent mutations in protein-coding genes which can vary spatially in separated sub-regions of tissues. This project will develop computational methods to infer tissue-spatial epigenomic landscape which can not be measured using current techniques, leveraging the emerging technologies of spatial transcriptomics, and develop novel statistical methods to identify differential epigenomic signals across patients or cell populations.

"EFFICIENT METHODS FOR CALIBRATION, CLUSTERING, VISUALIZATION AND IMPUTATION OF LARGE scRNA-seq DATA Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling provides an unprecedented opportunity to conduct detailed cellular analysis of cell subpopulations. Fulfilling the promise of scRNA-seq for biomedical studies and biomarker discovery requires robust computational approaches to support detection of rare phenotypes and unanticipated cellular responses. Current approaches for imputation, calibration, clustering and visualizing of scRNA-seq data suffer from challenges such as erroneous imputing of non-expressed genes, limitation of linear assumptions in removal of multivariate batch effects, and inefficiencies of clustering and dimensional reduction methods of very large datasets. We have developed spectral, neural network, and Fast Multipole Methods (FMM) prototypes suitable for addressing these issues in the context of scRNA-seq and other high throughput data contexts and propose to further develop and adapt these methods to scRNA-seq data analysis. Our team of experts on data analytics and computational biology is currently funded through the NIH BD2K initiative to develop novel big data tools and methods that have broad applicability to biomedical science. This effort proved the feasibility of extremely efficient scalable prototypes of neural network, spectral, and harmonic analysis techniques suitable for calibrating, reducing the dimensionality and visualizing high dimensional data, finding intrinsic state-probability densities, and co-organizing cells, markers and samples. We propose substantial advances over existing analytical procedures used in single cell RNA-seq studies including matrix recovery approaches for the sparse and noisy scRNA-seq data by combining matrix completion and statistical techniques (Aim 1A), and calibration based on our unsupervised MMD-ResNet neural network prototype and optimal transport theory (Aim 1B). We will develop a variant of the FMM approach to speed up the calculation of the repulsion term of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) visualization technique, which will improve our current fastest t-SNE FFT-based FIt-SNE prototype, and develop new reliable approximate nearest neighbors approaches to speed up the computation of the attraction term of t-SNE and other clustering algorithms (Aim 2A). Our additional variants of t-SNE will be further developed to allow better separation between clusters of cell subpopulations (late exaggeration) and better visualization using 1D t-SNE for heatmap gene-cell representation (Aim 2A). We will adapt SpectralNet, our efficient neural network approach, for computing graph Laplacian eigenvectors for large datasets. This will enable computation of spectral clustering, diffusion maps and manifold learning that are utilized in many scRNA studies but are currently limited to a moderate number of single cells (Aim 2B). Finally, we will develop a kernel based differential abundance algorithm to characterize differences between biological conditions (Aim 2C). We will adopt appropriate sampling approaches to significantly improve current methods. This research plan aims at developing scalable spectral computational and neural network tools suitable for analyzing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets. Specifically, our team which is led by a computational biologist, two prominent applied mathematicians and two prominent biologists will develop and validate scalable and novel techniques for: (i) completing missing values prevalent in these measurements, (ii) removing batch effect, (iii) reducing dimensionality and visualizing very large single cell RNA sequencing datasets and enabling detection of rare cell populations as well as detecting minute changes of cell populations between biological conditions.

"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,10086894,R01NS116350,"['ALS pathology', 'ALS patients', 'Address', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Lateral Sclerosis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'functional disability', 'graph theory', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuron loss', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'precision medicine', 'protein TDP-43', 'regional difference', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'stem', 'symptomatology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R01,2021,576665
"Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms Project Summary/Abstract  Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces. The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical, and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single- cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired environments. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance  Bacterial biofilms are responsible for a large number of hospital-acquired infections, and currently used antibiotic and disinfection treatments are unable to cope with this epidemic. An integrated understanding of how individual bacterial cells act and interact with each other inside biofilms is necessary to inform new strategies for controlling biofilm growth. This project enables high-resolution, single-cell measurements inside living biofilms by developing new technologies for non-invasive biofilm imaging and computational tracking of thousands of bacterial cells in crowded environments.",Non-Invasive Single-Cell Morphometry and Tracking in Living Bacterial Biofilms,10247048,R01GM139002,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Disinfection', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Escherichia coli', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Activation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Linear Programming', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Myxococcus xanthus', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Optics', 'Pathogenicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Shigella flexneri', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Specimen', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'antibiotic tolerance', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell behavior', 'cell dimension', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'cohesion', 'environmental stressor', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'human pathogen', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'lens', 'live cell imaging', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'model design', 'morphometry', 'new technology', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'seal', 'social', 'stressor', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,302199
"Integrating primate-rodent cell types and epigenomics to identify conservation in substance addiction Project Summary/Abstract Substance use disorders (SUD) of many highly addictive drugs affect more than 100 million people worldwide. Genetic variations associated with complex neuro-behavioral traits, such as drug addiction, are likely to impact enhancers which have a high degree of cell type-specificity and can be conserved across species. Furthermore, variation in addiction behavior has been linked to genetic variation in both human and rodents. Thus, it follows that genetic mechanisms driving addiction behavior, specifically at cell type-specific enhancers, might also be conserved between primates and rodents. I hypothesize that risk variants for some SUDs may lie in enhancers of distinct cell types in the reward areas and not others, providing insight into the cell types that are critical to SUDs. This project proposes to identify the gene markers and putative enhancers of cell types that are conserved or clade-specific to primates and rodents and of these, which are enriched for SUD human genetic risk variants. The proposal comprises of the following aims: Aim 1: identify the primate-rodent conserved cell types and marker gene profiles enriched for human SUD risk variants. Aim 2: identify the primate-rodent conserved putative enhancer profiles to test whether mouse substance use behavior risk loci disrupt similar putative conserved enhancers to human SUD risk loci. Together, these experiments could reveal primate-rodent gene and enhancer atlas of conserved and species-specific cell types of the reward system by integrating single-nuclei genomics data across multiple mammalian species. This information is critically important because better understanding of how an individual’s genetic makeup could affect the cells of the reward circuit will inform future work to craft personalized, targeted SUD therapy. Thus, this work integrates closely with my clinical interests in addiction medicine. This proposal outlines a combination of rigorous mentored research training, longitudinal clinical experiences, coursework, and professional and leadership development activities. The intellectual, technical, and professional skills refined during this fellowship training period will be instrumental in my development as an aspiring physician scientist in the clinical field of addiction medicine. Project Narrative Substance use disorders affect more than 100 million people worldwide and are influenced by the genetic makeup of the individual, in humans as well as rodent models. In this proposal, I will investigate how genetic differences in humans and mice could influence sets of brain cell types shared across human, monkey, and rodents. These results will provide a foundation to link the power of rodent models to specific features of SUDs in humans.",Integrating primate-rodent cell types and epigenomics to identify conservation in substance addiction,10143371,F30DA053020,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nicotine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primates', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scientist', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transposase', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'leadership development', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mammalian genome', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuropsychiatry', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical research', 'prevent', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'skills', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Functional causality in regulating cell morphogenesis Morphogenesis is a fundamental process in a wide range of cell functions and therefore one of the best studied. Consequently, most of the contributing component processes and the majority of their molecular parts are known. Much less understood is how the many underlying component processes are integrated into a working whole. This integration is regulated by a system of chemical and mechanical pathways with i) a high level of non-linearity; ii) a high level of redundancy; and iii) a separation in space and time of cause and effect between component processes. A key consequence of such a pathway configuration is that perturbation of any component can lead to wide-ranging and fast adaptation. Hence, phenotypic changes primarily reflect a reconfiguration of the system and not necessarily the function of the perturbed target. This challenge has plagued the interrogation of molecular functions in cell morphogenesis, and has led to numerous controversies that likely relate to slight differences in experimental designs triggering divergent adaptation processes. To circumvent some of these limitations, my lab has developed over the past 10 years quantitative live cell imaging methods that reveal the functional interplay between spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes, such as cytoskeleton polymer dynamics, forces, and chemical signals, based on the coupling of their spontaneous activation fluctuations in unperturbed systems. Building on key discoveries of cell morphogenic control mechanisms, which required the use of a perturbation-free approach rather than a more conventional experimental paradigm, we propose here an extension of this research program that will introduce a rigorous statistical framework to infer the coupling of molecular processes in cause and effect cascades. This includes algorithms to identify directly, from fluctuation time series, feedback interactions between processes and the dynamic rewiring of the cause and effect cascades under variable cellular conditions. These computational developments will be paralleled by innovation in experimental systems for multispectral live cell imaging of up to 8 concurrent processes and for the analysis of cell morphogenesis in native tissue environments in 3D. The studies will be focused on the coordination of the system of highly redundant actin modulating factors in promoting actin mediated cell shape changes and the interactions of this system with the regulatory system of RhoGTPase signals. The impact of this work will reach far beyond the new insights we will gain of the regulation of these pathway systems. The work will address the notorious adaptation responses of complex molecular systems, which are generic and a fundamental impediment to the systematic inquiry of cell functions. The tools we develop to overcome some of these problems will be made available as widely-adoptable approaches to the analysis of cell regulatory processes. The ability of cells to control their shape and architecture in response to changing cell-external and -internal conditions is the basis of almost every aspect in normal physiology. Deficiencies in this control are the cause of innumerable pathologies and diseases. In this research program, the PI and his laboratory will continue to develop innovative research methods integrating molecular cell biology, live cell microscopy, computer vision, and statistical and mathematical modeling to probe the complex interplay of spatially and temporally distributed chemical signals and mechanical forces that underlie the morphogenic processes.",Functional causality in regulating cell morphogenesis,10150038,R35GM136428,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'mathematical model', 'mechanical force', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R35,2021,664207
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies. The SD-NSC will establish cutting-edge Research Resource Cores focused on: 1) novel human cell and organoid models of aging, including from a unique human aging cohort that is annotated for physical and functional measures of biological age, 2) single-cell and high resolution -omics and imaging techniques, and 3) computational modelling of aging networks. The SD-NSC Research Resource Cores will provide scientific services to the NSC Network and the aging research community, and disseminate samples, datasets protocols, and computational tools. These resources will be complemented by a Research Development Core and Center outreach activities that will provide: 1) pilot grants and customized mentoring programs to encourage and support early-stage and established investigators new to aging research, 2) innovative in- person and virtual training in advanced methods and technologies to address cellular heterogeneity, and 3) intellectual leadership through novel programming to encourage collaboration and the dissemination of knowledge related to the basic biology of aging.

"Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Project Summary High-throughput profiling of hundreds of thousands of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) is currently underway. One of the goals of the BRAIN initiative is to build a census of cell types in the CNS, however previous work in single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has demonstrated that reliance on small collections of marker genes for cell type/state/position classification is insufficient to account for the dynamic nature of and variation in cellular classes/states. Previous work from both myself and others has demonstrated that latent space methods identify low dimensional patterns from high dimensional profiling data can discover molecular drivers of cell types and states in scRNAseq. However, the use of algorithms untethered to biological constraints or not extensively functionally validated can lead to the arbitrary delineation of cell class/state and the trivial designation of “novel” cell types. As proper development of the CNS requires precise regulation and coordination of spatial and temporal cues, the overall objective of this application is to develop analytic and experimental methods that integrate spatiotemporal information with scRNAseq to learn meaningful latent spaces. Specifically, I will 1) generate a comprehensive collection of transcriptional signatures for spatial features of the brain, 2) build dimension reduction software to encode spatial and cell cycle information to account for the highly specific organization of cells in the CNS, 3) derive a statistic, projectionDrivers, that allows for quantification of the gene drivers of differential latent space usage, and 4) define a statistic, proMapR, that will tell you the probability of a cell existing in a particular location in the brain at a given point in time from the cell's transcriptional signature. The ability to define and validate biologically meaningful latent spaces not only enables multiOmic data integration and exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via the massive amount of publicly available data, but also lays the groundwork for multimodal data integration—a necessary next step to characterize how individual cells and complex neural circuits interact in both time and space. Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods Applicant: Genevieve Stein-O’Brien, PhD MHS Proper development of the brain requires precise regulation and coordination of spatiotemporal cues. We hypothesize human genetic variation manifests phenotypic differences by introducing small biases in spatiotemporal determinants that have accumulated effect over development. To test this hypothesis, we build novel computational and experimental tools to resolve transcriptional regulation of anatomical identity (space) and cell cycle length (time) in the brain and apply these tools to induced pluripotent stem cells from ALS patients in a model of brain development to show the effect of genetic background.",Resolving Spatiotemporal Determinants of Cell Specification in Corticogenesis with Latent Space Methods,10188106,K99NS122085,"['ALS patients', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CCRL2 gene', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Experimental Models', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'data integration', 'functional plasticity', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'multimodal data', 'nervous system development', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'nucleotide analog', 'pedagogy', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'tool']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,110674
"Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. Although it is known that the transcription factor TCF-1 is required for memory CD8+ T cell function, the mechanisms through which this protein controls memory T cell fate remain unclear. Recently, we discovered that a mechanism through which TCF-1 controls the development of T cells relates to its unprecedented ability to create the chromatin accessibility landscape of naïve T cells. We found that TCF-1 is selectively enriched at genomic regions that become accessible at the earliest stages of development and is required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements. At the single-cell level, TCF-1 can dictate a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. Moreover, ectopic TCF-1 can directly erase repressive chromatin marks in non-T cells, generating de novo open chromatin and inducing the expression of T cell genes. While our recent data determined the novel role of TCF-1 on the epigenome during T cell development, our findings also raised another critical question: what is the role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells? We hypothesize that TCF-1 in cooperation with transcription factor partners defines the epigenetic landscape of memory T cells. Our new preliminary data further indicate that TCF-1 expression post T cell activation in vitro can lead to gains in chromatin accessibility at pro-memory genes. However, it remains unclear if TCF-1 expression in T cells responding to an infection can create the epigenetic identity of memory T cells. The domains of TCF-1 required for targeting the chromatin and its potential cooperating factors also remain unknown. How TCF-1 dependent changes on the epigenome relate to pro-memory genes needs to be defined. To answer these questions, we will interrogate the effect of TCF-1 and its potential partners on the chromatin state and accessibility of CD8+ T cells in vitro. Using the state-of-the-art tools, we will generate the map of TCF-1 dependent 3D genome organization and define how changes on the epigenome relate to memory genes. We will further translate these findings in vivo exploiting single-cell epigenomic, transcriptomic, and flow cytometry assays. The expected outcome of this proposal is a detailed understanding of the fundamental interaction between TCF-1 and the chromatin in peripheral T cells which can be exploited to devise combination therapies including epigenetic editing to selectively alter T cell fate at will. Our adaptive immune system has evolved a unique capacity to remember a pathogen through the generation of memory T cells, which protect the host in the event of reinfection. A better understanding of memory T cell differentiation is crucial for developing strategies to limit T cell responses in organ transplantation or enhance T cell responses during chronic infections. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of transcription factor TCF-1 in determining the epigenetic identity of memory CD8+ T cells. ",Critical role of TCF-1 on the epigenetic identity of memory T cells,10087956,R01HL145754,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effector Cell', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'FOXO1A gene', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Peripheral', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Cell Activation', 'T-Cell Development', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TCF Transcription Factor', 'Techniques', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Thymus Gland', 'Translating', 'base', 'cell type', 'chronic infection', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'immunoregulation', 'in vivo', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pathogen', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,451689
"Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state Abstract Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate (Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions. Once complete, the proposed work will provide not only a general tool for integrative analysis of multiomics data but also specific mechanistic insights for understanding the regulation of immune system functions. Narrative The immune cells are diverse and have different functions despite they all share the same genome. Deciphering the regulatory program defining the cell types and cell state is thus important for developing new therapeutics.",Systems-level identification of key regulators deciding immune cell state,10132232,R01AI150282,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Autoimmunity', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specificity', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Tai Ji', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'clinical application', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'differential expression', 'immune system function', 'immunoengineering', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'patient response', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'success', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,699745
"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Human organ systems require temporally and spatially coordinated multicellular actions at a macroscale to actuate, sustain, or terminate dedicated and vital functions. Cells that comprise discrete or distributed physiologic systems that fail to respond to appropriate stimuli with coordination may cause significant morbidity and often mortality. Collective and coordinated physiologic activities typically involve millions to billions of cells that may span large physical distances. Technologies for quantifying the electrical, chemical, and mechanical coupling in these multicellular systems are critically important to understanding the underlying mechanisms of disease and develop therapeutic approaches. However, no technology currently exists to quantify rapid mechanical cell responses to transmitted distal perturbations for all cells within a collection of cells. This multi- PI proposal (Chiou (contact PI) and Teitell) aims to develop a new platform imaging technology called SPOT (single pixel optical technology) for concurrent and direct measurements of cellular traction forces over a 1.0 x 1.0 cm2 field of view (FOV) with cellular spatial resolution, and a 1,000 frames/sec temporal resolution. SPOT provides a 4-order of magnitude larger FOV than conventional traction force microscopy. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) are the test bed here because of a high potential for impact in cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality in the Western World. We will demonstrate the ability for SPOT to determine quantitative indices of abnormalities for human CM contraction and relaxation in healthy and diseased states. We will establish proof of concept studies in SPOT screens for small molecules that augment or affect CM contraction in desmoplakin deficient states. We will build a platform that integrates SPOT for direct contraction force measurements and Optical Mapping for electrical property measurements for sheets of CMs. This will enable, for the first time, studies of temporal and spatial electromechanical coupling behaviors for sheets of CMs at single cell resolution. We will distinguish different subtypes of CMs, their distributions, their interactions, and their phenotypic responses under external perturbations. And we will apply this platform to investigate the structural and electromechanical coupling properties of hESC-derived CMs by integrating quantitative biomass and stiffness data measured using non-invasive live cell interferometry (LCI). Changes in biomass and cell stiffness are druggable biophysical parameters with correlates to mechanical contraction/relaxation cycles of CMs. In addition to detailed studies of CMs that have the potential to impact the number one killer of US citizens, SPOT applications should have utility and provide new insights in additional settings that require cell or tissue traction-force generation. Such settings could include models in a dish for wound healing, cancer cell metastasis, or models of diseases that affect cell and tissue structural integrity, such as connective tissue disorders Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndromes. PROJECT NARATIVE Our proposal is exclusively technology development but portends public health relevance because we will invent a way to quantify previously undiscoverable interactions and mechanical responses to external and internal perturbations in interconnected biological systems, as occurs in physiologic and pathologic states. We will develop, test and fine-tune a new technology platform called SPOT (Single Pixel Optical Technology) to extract mechanical responses at cellular resolution in a very wide field, in real-time, concurrently for all cells in a sheet to enable studies and potentially new-age therapeutics that are currently impossible.",SPOTs: Optical Technologies for Instantly Quantifying Multicellular Response Profiles,10160919,R01GM127985,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Biomass', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Distal', 'Drug Screening', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibroblasts', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Giant Cells', 'Goals', 'Heart Atrium', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Interferometry', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Marfan Syndrome', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacology Study', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Spottings', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'Transplantation', 'Ventricular', 'Western World', 'biological systems', 'biophysical properties', 'body system', 'cancer cell', 'design', 'desmoplakin', 'electrical measurement', 'electrical property', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mechanical properties', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'patch clamp', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'regenerative', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,379224
"Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina Studies of the visual system face a number of challenges, two of which are the intricacy of the cell types and synaptic connections that comprise the nervous system, and the complexity of the computational processes that underlie vision. Although the retina is one of the most characterized and well understood neural circuits of the visual system, it nonetheless has a great diversity of cell types, connections and computations. The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual scenes, which have complex spatial and temporal structure. The processing of natural scenes has the greatest relevance towards a fundamental understanding retinal function, and the greatest clinical relevance. Yet most studies of retinal visual processing and circuitry focus on responses to simple artificial stimuli rarely encountered normally, such as flashing spots, drifting stripes and flickering checkerboards. With respect to retinal cell types greatest diversity lies in a class of inhibitory interneurons known as amacrine cells. These cells make extensive lateral and feedback connections, and although they form stereotyped connections between each other, excitatory bipolar cells, and ganglion cells that transit signals in the optic nerve, the functional effects of nearly all of these cell types are poorly understood. This proposal aims towards a direct characterization of the functional effects of amacrine cells under ethologically relevant stimuli, including natural scenes. We combine approaches of perturbation and recording using electrical and optical methods as well as computational modeling to characterize the specific contributions of amacrine cells to stimuli that include the representation of moving objects. We take advantage of recently developed computational approaches that can simultaneously capture the retinal response to a broad range of stimuli including natural scenes, capture a wide range of phenomena previously characterized only with artificial stimuli, and that have internal units highly correlated with retinal interneurons. Our goals are to 1) Create a quantitative understanding of the functional contributions of a class of sustained amacrine cells in the salamander retina for specific stimuli including those that represent moving objects and natural scenes, and test hypotheses related to dynamic effects on visual sensitivity and sensory features generated by those amacrine cells 2) Use molecularly defined amacrine cells in the mouse to quantitatively characterize the functional contribution of specific amacrine cell types to specific stimuli including artificial moving objects and natural scenes. These studies create a new way to generate and test hypotheses related to the quantitative effect of any interneuron on retinal output under any visual stimulus. Understanding how retinal circuitry creates visual processing under natural scenes is critical to our understanding of retinal mechanisms and diseases involving the degeneration of the retinal circuitry. In addition, the computational descriptions of retinal responses will be directly useful in the design of electronic retinal prosthesis systems. The retina is a complex network of many cell types, including the most diverse but poorlyunderstood class of cells, amacrine cells. By understanding how inhibitory neurons change neural processing in the retina under natural visual scenes, we can begin to address how these cells and their connections degenerate during retinal diseases, an essential step in designing treatments for these diseases. Furthermore, by creating accurate computational models of the retinal response to natural scenes, this research will be immediately applicable to electronic retinal prosthesis systems that aim to restore vision in cases of photoreceptor degeneration.",Function and circuitry of adaptive inhibition in the retina,10086475,R01EY022933,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Archives', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Methods', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Salamander', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spottings', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'ganglion cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'novel strategies', 'photoreceptor degeneration', 'predicting response', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'retinal prosthesis', 'sight restoration', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'visual processing', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,380427
"A ""Culture"" Shift: Integrated Bacterial Screening and Antibacterial Susceptibility Test on Microfluidic Digital Array for Bloodstream Infections PROJECT SUMMARY The ability for clinicians to effectively treat bacterial infections with targeted antibacterials in the acute-care settings hinges on diagnostics capable of identifying the pathogen broadly and determining its susceptibility to antibacterials in a timely manner. Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a particularly representative disease because it is the leading cause of death due to infections with rapid disease progression. Unfortunately, the inconvenient delay of blood culture for definitive diagnosis contributes to widespread empiric use of broad- spectrum antibacterials and emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens. Toward addressing this critical unmet need, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform that integrates bacterial detection, species identification (ID), and antibacterial susceptibility testing (AST) from blood samples in a streamlined test. The expected sample-to-answer turnaround time is 90 min for ID and as early as 2-3 hr for AST. Such integrated diagnostic solution within the proposed timeframe will transform acute-care clinicians’ ability to establish diagnosis of bacterial infections, need for infection control, and antibacterial treatment based on objective data to improve clinical outcome. Using an innovative microfluidic digital array chip for assaying single cells as a backbone technology, we propose to develop a new molecular diagnostic platform which promises rapid ID and AST and allows customizable workflow and assay tailored to the clinical scenario while adjustable based on real-time results. The array chip seamlessly integrates digitization of cells, brief incubation (under various drug conditions), single-cell PCR (scPCR) or reverse transcriptase PCR (scRT-PCR) and single-cell high-resolution melt (scHRM). Thereby, bacterial pathogen can be detected at the level of single-cells, identified based on species- specific melt curves, and their antibacterial susceptibility profile subsequently assessed by measuring changes in rRNA level as a biosynthetic marker of cell viability. ScPCR/scRT-PCR enables sensitive detection and absolute quantification of rRNA of individual cells critical to rapid and reliable differentiation between viable and no-viable cells; while scHRM overcomes a key limitation of bulk HRM to resolve multiple species for diagnosing polymicrobial infections or discarding contaminations. Since both ID and AST do not rely on culture, they reduce total turnaround time from days to minutes/hours. We have assembled a superb team of multi-disciplinary investigators and industry advisors with complementary expertise and strong track record of team science. We propose the following aims:1) to develop a streamlined BSI diagnostic protocol for integrated ID and AST; 2) to develop a microfluidic array chip that enables ID and AST with single-cell resolution; 3) to develop instrument and analysis programs for single- cell ID and AST; and 4) to demonstrate the single-cell diagnostic platform, we will perform analytical and pilot clinical validation studies.

"Computational tools for regulome mapping using single-cell genomic data Project Summary Understanding how genes' activities are controlled is crucial for elucidating the basic operating rules of biology and molecular mechanisms of diseases. Recent innovations in single-cell genomic technologies have opened the door to analyzing a variety of functional genomic features in individual cells. These technologies enable scientists to systematically discover unknown cell subpopulations in complex tissue and disease samples, and allow them to reconstruct a sample's gene regulatory landscape at an unprecedented cellular resolution. Despite these promising developments, many challenges still exist and must be overcome before one can fully decode gene regulation at the single-cell resolution. In particular, current technologies lack the ability to accurately measure the activity of each individual cis-regulatory element (CRE) in a single cell. They also cannot measure all functional genomic data types in the same cell. Moreover, the prevalent technical biases and noises in single-cell genomic data make computational analysis non-trivial. With rapid growth of data, lack of computational tools for data analysis has become a rate-limiting factor for effective applications of single-cell genomic technologies.  The objective of this proposal is to develop computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory landscape using single-cell genomic data. Our Aim 1 addresses the challenge of accurately measuring CRE activities in single cells using single-cell regulome data. Regulome, deﬁned as the activities of all cis-regulatory elements in a genome, contains crucial information for understanding gene regulation. The state-of-the-art technologies for mapping regulome in a single cell produce sparse data that cannot accurately measure activities of individual CREs. We will develop a new computational framework to allow more accurate analysis of individual CREs' activities in single cells using sparse data. Our Aim 2 addresses the challenge of collecting multiple functional genomic data types in the same cell. We will develop a method that uses single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the most widely used single-cell functional genomic technology, to predict cells' regulatory landscape. Since most scRNA-seq datasets do not have accompanying single-cell data for other -omics data types, our method will also signiﬁcantly expand the utility and increase the value of scRNA- seq experiments. Our Aim 3 addresses the challenge of integrating different data types generated by different single-cell genomic technologies from different cells. We will develop a method to align single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell regulome data to generate an integrated map of transcriptome and regulome.  Upon completion of this proposal, we will deliver our methods through open-source software tools. These tools will be widely useful for analyzing and integrating single-cell regulome and transcriptome data. By addressing several major challenges in single-cell genomics, our new methods and tools will help unleash the full potential of single-cell genomic technologies for studying gene regulation. As such, they can have a major impact on advancing our understanding of both basic biology and human diseases. Project Narrative Understanding how genes' activities are controlled at single-cell resolution is crucial for studying human diseases. This proposal will develop a coordinated set of computational and statistical methods and software tools for mapping and analyzing gene regulatory programs using single-cell genomic data.

"Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and atherosclerosis Project Summary/Abstract This competitive renewal is based on work demonstrating that a subpopulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in atherosclerotic plaques undergo a transition to a mesenchymal cell fate that involves loss of barrier function, expression of inflammatory genes and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This transition is initiated by inflammatory signaling that sensitizes cells to TGFβ, which then drives the mesenchymal fate transition. A key consequence of the mesenchymal phenotype is production of a fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix that amplifies inflammatory signaling, recruiting leukocytes and production of cytokines. This sequence of events thus creates positive feedback, a key feature of disease progression and resistance to therapy. Our work during the past grant cycle has provided evidence that fate switching is driven by a minor subset of pre-existing, susceptible ECs that drive vessel wall remodeling. Our work has also elucidated novel pathways by which matrix remodeling alters integrin signaling to enhance inflammatory pathways and promotes disease progression. The overall goal of the current application is to understand the EC subpopulations and factors that drive fate switching, and the positive feedback mechanisms that drive disease. Aim 1 will elucidate endothelial heterogeneity in mice and in patients with atherosclerosis. Aim 2 will characterize disease-prone subset of normal endothelial cells. Aim 3 will elucidate the role of pro-inflammatory integrin signaling in evolution of EC populations in the atherosclerotic plaque and the downstream pathways that mediate plaque progression. Project Narrative Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory/metabolic disease in which cells of the artery wall remodel to form a plaque that can narrow vessel lumens or rupture and block blood flow. This grant aims to understand the changes in endothelial cell fate that govern vessel remodeling and the pathways by which these changes promote disease.

"UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center Project Summary / Abstract A major shortcoming of most efforts to understand the 4D nucleome is that they have mainly focused on in vitro cell lines, rather than on dynamic, in vivo systems. Arguably, the most important in vivo system, which also happens to be the most dynamic, is development itself, wherein the nucleome both shapes and is shaped by the initial emergence of the myriad mammalian cell types. While these in vivo dynamics are presently poorly documented and understood, recently emerged technologies offer a path forward. Here we propose to establish the University of Washington 4-Dimensional Genomic Nuclear Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME Center), which will address these massive gaps in our understanding by generating systematic datasets on nuclear morphology and associated molecular measurements in mammalian tissues and cell types. These datasets will be generated in the context of the leading model organism for mammalian development, the mouse. Our approach focuses on following nuclear structure, chromatin and gene expression changes at a “whole organism” scale, using a combination of scalable single cell profiling and “visual cell sorting” (VCS) methods, all well-established and mostly developed in our own labs. Our goal is to generate a high- resolution 4DN atlas of mouse embryogenesis for the community. The different types of data will be integrated, including cross-species imputation to integrate with human data, as well as models and navigable maps applied to pathways relevant to mammalian development. Project Narrative The UW 4D Genome Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center (UW 4D GENOME) aims to elucidate chromatin dynamics during the early stages of mammalian development. Accordingly, the proposed center will carry out systematic generation of sequencing and imaging data during mouse embryogenesis, summarizing and visualizing the resulting data using machine learning models. These approaches will also be applied to investigate nuclear architecture in mouse models with mutations in genes relevant to nuclear structure, which will help advance our understanding of diseases such as laminopathy and cancer.",UW 4-Dimensional Genomic Organization of Mammalian Embryogenesis Center,10265565,UM1HG011586,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Chromosomes', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Four-dimensional', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterochromatin', 'Hi-C', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lamin Type A', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'RNA', 'Resolution', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Washington', 'Whole Organism', 'X Inactivation', 'base', 'cell type', 'human data', 'human disease', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'knowledge translation', 'lamin B receptor', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'novel', 'nucleophosmin', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web portal']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,UM1,2021,2031051
"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Human Retina PROJECT SUMMARY Vision, the most important of the human senses, occupies 25% of the brain function. It requires an orchestrated coordination between all parts of the eye. Of all the parts, the retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image. It is a precisely layered structure lining the surface of the back of the eye, comprising many millions of cells packed together in a tightly knit network. The optic nerve connects the retina with the brain. The retina not only receives light, but also processes it, and transmits downstream signals to the midbrain and the thalamus. When the retina becomes diseased, the unfortunate result is blindness, which is the most feared disability. Diseases that affect the retina are complex because of the diverse number of cell types and total number of cells involved. It remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes affect diverse cell populations versus highly specific cell types. While advances in retinal disease diagnostics have progressed rapidly, treatments for retinal diseases directed at primary genetic defects have progressed slowly. Despite major successes in genetics, the vision community is lagging behind the advances in precision medicine occurring in other specialties. Modest progress is due in part to an incomplete understanding of human retinal biology. Anatomical differences between humans and commonly used animal models have severely hindered the translation of results from laboratory to human health. Therefore, there is an urgent need to collect and analyze retinal cells from human eyes to advance our understanding of human retinal diseases and assess the cell type conservation between mouse and human. Recent technologic breakthroughs in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) have made it possible to measure gene expression in single cells, paving the way for exploring cellular heterogeneity. Collaborating with the Alabama Eye Bank, we will deeply sample human retinal cells, fully characterize cell diversity, and elucidate the functional roles of findings from genome- wide association studies for retinal diseases. We propose the following aims. Aim 1 will generate scRNA-seq data from eyes of 20 healthy adult human donors, and produce de-noised gene expression data for downstream analyses. Aim 2 will characterize cell diversity in human retina and supporting tissues, and validate novel cell type-specific marker genes by immunohistochemistry. Aim 3 will infer cell type compositions and allele-specific gene expression in each cell type by integrating scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data from normal human eyes. These pioneering studies leverage novel methods and interdisciplinary expertise to characterize cell type-specific gene expression in human retina and supporting tissues. By detailed characterization of the cell atlases in four geographical areas in human eye, our study will provide novel insights into cell-type specific functions that can power precision therapeutic targeting of retinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE The retina is the most vital for normal perception of an image in the eye. Diseases that affect the retina are complex, and it remains challenging to assess if pathological phenotypes originate in diverse cell populations or highly specific cell types.

"Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis Abstract While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities, spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals, we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively- parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single- cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in Genomics and Systems Biology. Project Narrative Understanding how the molecular components, inherited lineage, and spatial milieu of single cells dictate function in health and disease remains a key outstanding challenge in genomics. The overarching goal of our Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis is to develop methods to simultaneously assess these multimodal cellular properties, develop tools to harmonize them to allow inferential assessment of cell identity based on partial phenotyping, and share these developments with the broad scientific community while encouraging community engagement through education and outreach. Success in our strategy will facilitate deep, multi-omic phenotyping of single cells for basic research and clinical applications.",Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis,10176553,RM1HG011014,"['Academic Training', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epitopes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human body', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'New York City', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'reconstruction', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,RM1,2021,2935850
"T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium Project Summary  Tick-borne diseases are on the increase, and are responsible for nearly all of the vector-transmitted disease in the US. Vector-borne pathogens face the dual challenge of adaptation to two very different host environments: the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. To survive within eukaryotic cells, the rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum blocks phago-lysosome maturation, inhibits apoptosis, modulates host gene expression, redirects trans-Golgi trafficking, and repurposes autophagic machinery to build a replication vacuole. A. phagocytophilum must accomplish this, all while evading the unique innate immune defenses of mammalian and arthropod host cells. All pathogens in the order Rickettsiales utilize a specialized Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) to deliver effector molecules into the host cell cytosol to mediate host pathogen interactions. However, identification of the secreted effectors has been limited by the obligate nature of these pathogens. Even less is known about how effectors contribute to rickettsial growth in tick cells, as the tick vector remains an understudied niche of these pathogens. To overcome this, our group has developed a T4SS effector prediction program Optimal-features Predictor for T4SS Effectors (OPT4e). When applied to A. phagocytophilum, OPT4e identified 48 putative T4SS effectors. Transcriptomics finds that 15 of these predicted effector genes are specifically expressed during growth within either tick or mammalian cells. We have demonstrated that one of these tick- specific effector candidates, Aph1383, is translocated in a T4 specific manner by the Legionella pneumophila T4SS. Aph1383 also belongs to a paralogous family of six proteins encoded by the gene cluster aph1380-1386. This entire cluster is expressed 2.5-fold more highly during A. phagocytophilum growth in tick cells than during mammalian cell infections. We hypothesize that this family of Aph1383 paralogs are all T4SS effectors which target host cell processes specifically important for A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. In this study, we will first use transposon insertion mutants in the aph1380-1386 gene cluster to test the fitness contribution of these genes during A. phagocytophilum growth within tick cells. Next, we will evaluate the T4SS translocation of all Aph1383 paralogs and identify the amino acid sequences necessary for secretion. Finally, we will identify the subcellular localization and molecular targets of Aph1383 within tick cells. Characterizing these molecular interactions of A. phagocytophilum within the tick cell will open the door to development of vector targeted interventions to reduce transmissibility of the pathogen. Project Narrative Vector-borne diseases account for >17% of the global burden of all infectious diseases. The ability of the tick-borne rickettsial pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum to manipulate the cell biology of both mammalian and tick cells is achieved through delivery of effector molecules by a specialized secretion system. This project investigates how a family of tick specific effectors enables A. phagocytophilum to survive and replicate within tick cells.",T4SS effectors and tick tropism in Anaplasma phagocytolium,10174737,R21AI154023,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anaplasma', 'Anaplasma phagocytophilum', 'Apoptosis', 'Arthropod Vectors', 'Arthropods', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Case Study', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Climate', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytosol', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Face', 'Family', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Growth', 'Human Cell Line', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Legionella pneumophila', 'Libraries', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Style', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Midgut', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nature', 'Parasites', 'Pattern', 'Phagolysosome', 'Process', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Rickettsia', 'Salivary Glands', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'Ticks', 'Transfection', 'Tropism', 'Type IV Secretion System Pathway', 'United States', 'Vacuole', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'cell type', 'feeding', 'fitness test', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neutrophil', 'paralogous gene', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'programs', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tick-borne', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector tick', 'vector-borne pathogen']",NIAID,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,229500
"Niche signals in HSC genesis PROJECT SUMMARY Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have well established clinical applications in the treatment of heritable and acquired blood disorders. However, their therapeutic potential could be significantly broadened by engineering novel methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells or from directly reprogrammed adult cells. Toward this goal, we have established endothelial cell (EC) niche based culture methods that provide the necessary conditions to support the specification and self-renewal of HSC from embryonic hemogenic precursors, and more recently, from adult ECs using transcription factor (TF)-mediated conversion that bypasses a pluripotent intermediate. We hypothesize that recreating the signals necessary and sufficient to develop a clinically meaningful system for HSC generation in vitro will necessitate a comprehensive, systems approach to deconstruct the niche provided signals required for HSC specification and self-renewal. Thus, the overall goal of this grant is to leverage unique expertise of the collaborating laboratories to elucidate the signaling interactions regulating HSC specification and self-renewal from embryonic hemogenic precursors or TF-reprogrammed adult EC in the context of the EC niche. Our approach consists of three overlapping aims. The first aim will identify EC niche-provided signals necessary for embryonic HSC specification and self-renewal. The second aim will identify the unique HSC programs induced by these signals that regulate the transition from embryonic hemogenic precursor to bone fide repopulating HSC. The third will identify comparable programs that regulate the transition from adult EC to HSC during TF-mediated reprogramming in the EC niche. Key to these studies will be innovative functional assays, transcriptional profiling methods, and computational approaches that will enable us to resolve cellular complexity of niche cells and their interactions with developing embryonic or reprogrammed HSC at the single cell level. The role of identified signal factors in stage-specific support of HSC specification will be validated and further refined in vitro by gain and loss of function studies in the context of niche EC. Furthermore, to extend these studies to stromal cell-free systems as a step toward clinical translation, we will also test the contribution of identified signal factors in HSC specification and self-renewal in the context of stage-specific modulation of Notch activation using engineered Notch agonists. To achieve the goals of this proposal, we have developed a multidisciplinary collaboration involving unique expertise in each of our laboratories, including basic HSC and EC niche cell biology, direct TF based cellular conversion, clinical HSC transplantation, genome wide assessment of rare stem cell populations at single cell resolution, and innovative computational approaches to deconstruct core signal pathways regulating developmental transitions. Altogether, we expect the proposed studies will ultimately guide the design of novel strategies for deriving and expanding HSC in vitro for therapeutic applications. NARRATIVE Hematopoietic stem cells are currently used in the treatment and cure of a variety of blood disorders. Methods to generate new or greater numbers of hematopoietic stem cells in the laboratory could expand the availability and therapeutic applications of these valuable cells, but currently such methods are lacking. The goal of this proposal is to use lessons from endothelial cells, which provide critical signals to support hematopoietic stem cells, to engineer novel systems for the development and expansion of hematopoietic stem cells in culture. !",Niche signals in HSC genesis,10224676,RC2DK114777,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Agonist', 'Aorta', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bypass', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Development', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal structure', 'Grant', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Specification', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Mediating', 'Mesonephric structure', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Stem Cell Development', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'base', 'blastomere structure', 'bone', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'embryonic stem cell', 'genome-wide', 'hematopoietic stem cell expansion', 'hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'machine learning algorithm', 'notch protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'receptor', 'self-renewal', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem', 'stem cell population', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,RC2,2021,650976
"Characterizing Shared Features of Innate Immune Cells across Neurodegenerative Diseases using Single Cell Expression and Chromatin Accessibility Data With few effective interventions available and over 10 million patients affected, neurodegenerative diseases are an area of intense basic science and clinical research. Inspired by Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) that have identified many risk variants linked to immune genes, neurobiologists are just beginning to understand the inflammatory basis for neurodegeneration. Across degenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (MS), computational techniques applied to single cell datasets are identifying the role of immune cells in driving pathological changes in the brain. For instance, recent single cell expression studies in AD have identified a novel type of Disease Associated Microglia (DAM) associated with the disease. Preliminary analysis I performed on single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients suffering from Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) recapitulated this DAM phenotype in AMD- derived microglia. Furthermore, analysis revealed that AMD-derived astrocytes drive neovascularization, a pathologic hallmark of AMD, through the increased expression of VEGF. These findings imply that neurodegeneration and pathologic changes in AMD are driven by innate immune cells, and, further, that these innate immune cell functions may be similar across neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that innate immune cell function and regulation that drives pathology is shared across neurodegenerative conditions. To identify these shared features, I will design and apply novel computational algorithms to single cell datasets from multiple neurodegenerative diseases - AMD, AD and MS - to elucidate the role of innate immune cells across conditions. In aim 1, I will apply a coarse graining algorithm, Diffusion Condensation, that clusters cells at all levels of granularity to identify pathologic microglial and astrocyte subsets in single cell expression data produced from retinal tissue of patients with AMD. I will further apply this technique to subset these innate immune cells in publicly available single cell expression datasets in MS and AD in order to identify gene modules shared among microglia and astrocytes across diseases. In aim 2, I will apply a multi-modal data alignment algorithm, Harmonic Alignment, that integrates single cell expression and chromatin accessibility data to produce a rich, joint expression and accessibility profile for every cell to identify epigenetic regulators of expression. When used to integrate datasets derived from AMD patients and controls, this algorithm will be able to identify chromatin regions and candidate transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes key to microglial and astrocytic dysfunction. By overlapping our knowledge of GWAS risk alleles from AMD, AD and MS, on top of predicted epigenetic regulators of innate immune cell dysfunction in a neurodegenerative context, I hope to be able to elucidate the effect of risk variants in inducing disease in a cell-type specific manner. These projects will help identify shared genomic and regulatory mechanisms in innate immune cells across neurodegenerative diseases and will help identify common pathways for future therapeutic development. In order to understand the inflammatory basis of neurodegenerative diseases, single cell expression and chromatin accessibility datasets need to be met with novel computational strategies. Our machine learning techniques will aim to understand the shared genomic and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of microglia and astrocytes in different neurodegenerative contexts: Multiple Sclerosis, Alzheimer’s Disease and Age-related Macular Degeneration. This proposal will identify specific genomic and epigenomic targets unique to innate immune cells shared across diseases that can aid in the development of immune-modulating interventions.",Characterizing Shared Features of Innate Immune Cells across Neurodegenerative Diseases using Single Cell Expression and Chromatin Accessibility Data,10141940,F30AI157270,"['Affect', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Induced Mutation', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modality', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physical condensation', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'multimodal data', 'multiple datasets', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'single cell analysis', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,30891
"Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis Metastasis causes >90% of breast cancer-related deaths. Tumor cell structures that have been hypothesized as necessary for metastasis are invadopodia, protrusions rich in structural proteins (e.g. Tks5), adhesion proteins (e.g. integrin β1) and proteases (e.g. MT1-MMP), known to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  A novel, real-time imaging methodology that allows investigation of the in vivo metastatic role of invadopodia found that cells which assemble invadopodia move at “Slow” speeds and are seen in perivascular niches. Outside of perivascular niches, “Fast” motile cells, which do not assemble invadopodia were observed. This method also showed that invadopodia are essential for intravasation in vivo.  Preliminary work has begun to determine which aspects of the Slow phenotype allow invadopodia assembly. Use of novel mathematical models, in vitro microscopy and novel computational image analysis demonstrates that whereas the Fast cells continuously locomote, the Slow cells are in either of two oscillating states: i. Invadopodia state, in which a cell is sessile while it degrades surrounding ECM; ii. Locomotion state, similar to a Fast cell. The oscillation dynamics appear to depend on interactions between the ECM and its receptor integrin β1. Importantly, the Invadopodia, but not Locomotion state, is limited to G1 phase of the cell cycle. Release from G1-arrest amplifies invadopodia, implying that G1-arresting therapies may promote metastasis. This project will identify the mechanisms unique to the Invadopodia state compared to cells that only proliferate or locomote, with the idea of targeting the Invadopodia state.  Overall Hypothesis: the Invadopodia state, which is essential for metastasis, requires a pause in both cell locomotion and cell cycle progression. The initiation and termination of the Invadopodia state are controlled by the interaction between the ECM, invadopodia components integrin β1 and Tks5, as well as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 (expressed during G1). Aim 1. Determine the role of the cell cycle in regulating the Invadopodia state. Using real-time imaging of cell cycle and invadopodia markers in vitro and in vivo, this Aim tests the hypothesis that cyclin- dependent kinases and corresponding inhibitors regulate the Invadopodia state, but not the Locomotion. Aim 2. Determine the role of ECM-cancer cell interactions in regulating the oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. This Aim will provide a strategy based on in vivo modification of integrin β1 activity on how to turn Invadopodia state ”off” towards metastatic prevention. Significance. Invadopodia is suggested as a new candidate target for metastatic prevention. The use of cell cycle inhibitors in patients with invadopodia may be accelerating metastatic dissemination. The long- term goal is to predict and prevent metastasis using invadopodia. This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of invadopodia regulation by the cell cycle and oscillations between Invadopodia and Locomotion states. Outcomes will reveal new invadopodia-related targets, which can be used to prevent metastasis in breast cancer.",Targeting invadopodia-related mechanisms of cancer cell invasion and metastasis,10151585,R01CA230777,"['3-Dimensional', 'Actins', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases', 'EMS1 gene', 'Equilibrium', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Degradation', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Feedback', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'G1 Arrest', 'G1 Phase', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Integrins', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'MMP14 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Metalloproteases', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scaffolding Protein', 'Speed', 'Structural Protein', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'crosslink', 'cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'intravital microscopy', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knock-down', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'protease E', 'real-time images', 'receptor', 'serial imaging', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,379870
"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,10087916,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,495785
"The Nanoscale Connectome of the Cochlear Nucleus The cochlear nucleus is the gateway for central nervous system processing of auditory information in mammals. It has been proposed that parallel processing channels are set up in the CN, and these form the basis for further computation at higher stations of the auditory system. Despite decades of study, enumeration of CN cell types is incomplete and CN circuitry is described only superficially. In neuroscience generally, classification and naming of neurons has relied primarily upon qualitative approaches based upon human observational capabilities. We have implemented and in some cases developed novel high-throughput and unbiased techniques for labeling, segmenting and classifying neurons in 3D, generated from large-scale electron microscopy image volumes. We propose to deliver a nanoscale map, or connectome, of the mouse CN with enumerated and localized cell types and their synaptic connections. This effort is unbiased because all neurons will be sampled. To achieve this goal, we bring together four parallel modes of tissue analysis for neuron classification: morphology, connectivity, molecular identity and function. We propose that connectivity analysis will define long-proposed parallel processing circuits that will be tested functionally using realistic biophysical models of identified cell types. Notably, the cochlear nucleus contains both amorphous and layered organizations of cells, which serve as templates for all other brain regions. By investigating the fundamental structure of this sensory center, we will establish principles of neural computation and methods for structural and functional phenotyping that will apply to other brain regions regardless of their particular neural architecture. Relevance to Public Health The goal of this project is to deliver to the auditory research community the connectome of the mouse cochlear nucleus. In the process we will refine and develop comprehensive and high throughput methods to catalogue cell types and their connections in any brain region, and will provide molecular phenotypes for cochlear nucleus cell types that may be useful in their targeted manipulation for research and therapeutic purposes.

"The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D ABSTRACT The pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) encompasses a spectrum ranging from aggressive autoimmunity toward islet β cells to defects in β-cell function that arise from inflammation. A perspective that has been gaining traction in recent years posits that intracellular signaling pathways arising from the β cell response to inflammation can lead to the production of aberrant proteins that serve as neoantigens that initiate or exacerbate autoimmunity. This perspective has prompted our Team to identify and intervene in intracellular signaling pathways that affect β-cell resilience as T1D progresses from the presymptomatic to symptomatic stages. This proposal takes a multidisciplinary Team Science approach that is responsive to RFA-DK-19-024 to define and intervene in early T1D disease processes affecting human islets. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals are transduced intracellularly to activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an effort to redirect energy expenditure to mitigate the prevailing stress. The translationally inhibited mRNAs and their associated proteins are sequestered into intracellular stress granules (SGs), the formations of which are thought to divert cellular signaling toward an emergency response. Our preliminary data suggest that the ISR is activated in islets during early T1D, and that the pathway linking membrane-derived lipids to the production of proinflammatory lipid intermediates may trigger the ISR and the formation of SGs. We hypothesize that the activation of the ISR and formation of SGs is an early cellular response initiating β cell stress in T1D that determines cell survival and can be monitored in pre- and early T1D individuals with minimal invasiveness. Our collaborative Team will test this hypothesis through the following aims:  Aim 1: Define the mechanisms of stress granule formation and their fate upon activation of the integrated stress response in human islets.  Aim 2: Determine the molecular events linking lipid metabolism, activation of the ISR, and stress granule formation in human islets.  Aim 3: Identify protein, RNA, and lipid cargo in EVs as putative biomarkers of the human islet integrated stress response and T1D risk.  This application leverages the expertise of 6 Multi-PIs in β-cell biology, lipid and eicosanoid biology, functional genomics, proteomics, computational modeling, and clinical islet studies. The impact of this project will be to deliver new knowledge on an unstudied stress pathway in human islets and to identify and validate biomarker panels that reflect this stress state. PROJECT NARRATIVE Type 1 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that results from dysfunction and death of islet β cells. The identification and characterization of new pathways promoting stress in β cells would allow for the institution of defined therapies that protect β cells and their function. This application proposes to study the integrated stress response in human β cells and to identify biomarkers that will collectively reflect the ""signature"" of stressed β cells in type 1 diabetes in humans.",The Integrated Stress Response in Human Islets During Early T1D,10262963,U01DK127786,"['Affect', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase', 'Autoimmunity', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Stress', 'Cellular biology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Eicosanoids', 'Emergency response', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Translation', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Knowledge', 'LOX gene', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Lipids', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Pancreas', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phospholipase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Registries', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Translating', 'Translation Initiation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker panel', 'cohort', 'diabetes risk', 'extracellular vesicles', 'functional genomics', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insulin dependent diabetes mellitus onset', 'islet', 'lipid metabolism', 'machine learning algorithm', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoantigens', 'resilience', 'response', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'stress granule', 'stress state', 'trafficking']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,U01,2021,768337
"Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the developed world; no cure exists and prevalence is rising rapidly. Because only primates have a macula and since no model of AMD exists in non-human primates, the disease course can only be elucidated through in-depth study of humans. Blindness in AMD is caused by progressive and irreversible death of rod and cone photoreceptors secondary to degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) that is essential for their health and function. Clinical imaging and histology have informed us greatly about the later stages of disease but fundamental knowledge to understand how AMD diverges from normal aging at onset is lacking. With advanced adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) imaging methods, combined with clinical imaging and visual function testing, we will characterize healthy human retinal aging in cross-sectional study, by defining the in vivo RPE-photoreceptor cellular organization and microscopic autofluorescence variation with age and wavelength. This will produce the largest quantitative in vivo normative dataset of AOO cell-based metrics to date and we will use this data to generate new quantitative analysis tools needed to evaluate emerging therapies designed to prevent or slow vision loss in AMD (Aim 1). In a case-control study, we will then compare normal photoreceptor topography and RPE cell morphometry to clinically defined early AMD to quantitatively define the earliest cellular changes in AMD that can be detected in vivo. This work will identify the cellular alterations and phenotypes that differentiate normal aging from early AMD to facilitate early onset detection. These results will be contextualized by comparison to tissue-level alterations seen with aging and early AMD in clinical imaging, specifically choriocapillaris decline and drusen (Aim 2). The results of this study will result in a paradigm shift from the use of clinical diagnosis and classification systems for AMD that rely solely on tissue- level biomarkers or traditional funduscopic clinical signs to those that rely on rigorous quantitative in vivo cell- based metrics. Together, this knowledge and these tools will lay the foundation needed to develop and evaluate new preventative therapies that are needed to limit or prevent vision loss in AMD. Project Narrative Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in the US and is a significant public health issue that is projected to worsen due to the rapidly aging population. Here we aim to understand how retinal cells change in normal aging and how these normal age-related changes differ from the changes that lead to age-related macular degeneration. This project will allow us to detect age-related macular degeneration earlier and will produce new tools to monitor retinal cells that will facilitate the development and testing of preventative therapies to slow or prevent vision loss in age-related macular degeneration.",Distinguishing normal aging from age-related macular degeneration at the level of single cells int eh living human eye,10172913,R01EY030517,"['Age', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Choroid', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Drusen', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lipofuscin', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Melanins', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primate Diseases', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Photoreceptors', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapy Evaluation', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adaptive optics', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'fluorophore', 'healthy aging', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'macula', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular unit', 'nonhuman primate', 'normal aging', 'prevent', 'restorative treatment', 'retinal imaging', 'retinal rods', 'therapy design', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,524330
"T cells in the aging brain SUMMARY The overarching goal of this project is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, with the objective of restoring old brain function. The brain has long been considered an ‘immuno-privileged organ’. However, recent studies have shown that immune cells infiltrate the brain in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and during aging. A key remaining challenge is to understand how immune cells impact the brain during aging, and could this knowledge be used to restore functionality of old brain and treat neurodegenerative diseases?  The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain provides a great paradigm to address this question, as this regenerative region of the brain contains many different cell types – neural stem cells (NSCs), endothelial cells, microglia – and exhibits clear functional decline during aging. To gain a single cell understanding of the changes that occur with age in neurogenic niches, we recently performed single cell RNA-sequencing of young and old neurogenic niches in mice. This analysis revealed a striking infiltration of cytotoxic T cells only in the old neurogenic niche, which was confirmed by immunofluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that T cells from old SVZs are clonally expanded and secrete interferon g (IFNg), suggesting that they have encountered specific antigens. We also showed that T cells can impair NSC proliferation both in co-cultures and in vivo. Based on these data, our specific hypothesis is that T cell clonal expansion in old brains drives the deterioration of the neurogenic niche with age, and that preventing this T cell expansion restores function to old neurogenic regions. Probing this idea would be critical to counter the decline in brain function during aging and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following experiments: 1. To determine how T cells infiltrate neurogenic niches in old individuals; 2. To understand the functional impact of T cells on old neurogenic niches; 3. To examine the interaction between immune cells and neurogenic niches in young, old, and rejuvenated individuals.  Completion of these aims will provide unique mechanistic insights into the regulation of T cell and other immune cells during aging in regenerative niches of the brain. This work should also give a fundamental understanding of the mechanistic impact of the interferon response and T cell cytotoxicity on different cell types in the brain. Knowledge from our study should pave the way for building transformative strategies, including new immunotherapies, for the restoration of a pristine tissue, which will be a critical step for improving brain function during aging and age-related diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. NARRATIVE As the organism ages, adult regenerative neural stem cell niches no longer produce new neurons. Adult neurogenic niches have been found to be important for aspects of learning and memory, raising the intriguing possibility that boosting the production of neurons by these niches may help preserve or enhance cognitive function with advancing age. Uncovering the immune-based mechanisms underlying the decline and rejuvenation of adult neurogenic niches during aging should give important insights into the factors that control regeneration in the normal aging nervous system as well as in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease.",T cells in the aging brain,10184422,R01AG071711,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Rejuvenation', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'T cell receptor repertoire sequencing', 'T cell regulation', 'T-Cell Depletion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'age related', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'functional decline', 'functional restoration', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo evaluation', 'insight', 'middle age', 'nerve stem cell', 'neuroblast', 'neurogenesis', 'normal aging', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'regenerative', 'response', 'restoration', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stem cell proliferation', 'subventricular zone', 'transcriptome']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,752242
"Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development Abstract The long term goal of this proposal is to quantitatively understand how gene regulatory networks (GRNs) generate the diversity of cell types during the development of the human brain. The focus of this proposal is to determine how key progenitor cell types that are uniquely enriched in humans are generated. Such an understanding is essential for uncovering the mechanisms of human developmental diseases. There are three challenges to achieving this goal: 1. Ethical issues in working with developing human tissue, 2. Computational and experimental techniques to determine the sequence of progenitor cell states and state transitions that give rise to the diversity of cell types, 3. the difficultly in building quantitative models of the gene regulatory networks in the absence of data to determine the thousands of biochemical constants. The approach of the proposal is to build the necessary computational, mathematical and experimental framework to overcome these challenges. To recapitulate early human brain development, the proposal will employ an in vitro human embryonic stem cell differentiation system. To obtain snapshots of the underlying gene regulatory network, high throughput single cell sequencing will be employed to obtain transcriptional profiles of thousands of single cells during the course of development. The challenge of inferring the sequence of cell states and cell state transitions will be overcome through a novel statistical method to obtain a joint probability distribution of the cell states, sequence of transitions and a key set of genes whose dynamics reflect these states and transitions. The inferences will be tested by mapping to in vivo data and using viral lineage tracing. The origins of forebrain and outer radial glial cells (oRG) progenitors uniquely enriched in the developing human forebrain will thus be determined. The challenge of building predictive models will be overcome by using methods from theoretical physics and ensemble modeling from statistics to build models that make probabilistic predictions. By using the available data as constraints on the model, the framework will extract joint probability distributions of all the parameters of the model. These distribution functions will then be used to produce probabilistic predictions about the responses of the underlying GRNs to perturbations. High probability predictions will be tested experimentally by perturbing gene expression and signaling during early brain development and the model will be iteratively improved. The success of this proposal will result in the first quantitative model of the gene regulatory network controlling the generation of forebrain and the oRG progenitor cells. If achieved, this work therefore would represent a major insight into the molecular and cellular events that give rise to the disproportionately gyrated human brain. Narrative The project seeks to gain a quantitative understanding of the molecular networks within cells that control the generation of key progenitor cell types that arise during human brain development. To do so, it will develop modeling and computational tools as well as test these tools on human embryonic stem cell lines. In the longer term, a quantitative understanding of the circuits within cells that control development will allow us to uncover mechanisms underlying developmental disease.",Determining lineage decisions and gene regulatory networks governing the generation of key progenitor cell types during early human brain development,10140399,R01HD100036,"['Animal Model', 'Bar Codes', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Ethical Issues', 'Event', 'Forebrain Development', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'LHX2 gene', 'Lentils - dietary', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Organism', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Prosencephalon', 'RNA', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Role', 'SOX11 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'course development', 'developmental disease', 'glial cell development', 'human data', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'human fetus tissue', 'human stem cells', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'progenitor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cells', 'subventricular zone', 'success', 'time interval', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,473866
"The Human Foveal Connectome The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time.

"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients.

"Integrated visualization, control, and analysis of GEF – GTPase networks in living cells A small number of Rho family GTPases participate in a broad array of fundamental cellular behaviors. Specificity is possible due to spatial and temporal control of GTPase “activation”; Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) generate activated, GTP-bound GTPases with precise timing and localization, while specialized interactions with adhesion molecules, membrane domains and other localized structures specify GEF-GTPase interactions. GEF/GTPase circuits are complex, with localized feedbacks, multiple GEFs controlling one GTPase, and vice versa. To dissect this spatiotemporally regulated circuitry requires imaging, and new analytical techniques that can dissect causal relationships from imaging data. Following the intentions of PAR- 19-158 (Bioengineering Research Grants), we propose a multidisciplinary collaboration leveraging organic chemistry, protein engineering, imaging, and computer science to fudnamentally advance signal transduction imaging and analysis. As a biological testbed we will explore the role of GEF-GTPase interactions in cell protrusion, single cell migration and collective migration. We will develop a generalizable approach to GEF biosensors, and adapt our proven GTPase biosensors to image GEF and GTPase activities in the same cell. Because GEF-GTPase interactions are heterogeneous and complex, multiplexed imaging is necessary to quantify their relative dynamics. However, perturbation of cell behavior is especially problematic when using two biosensors in the same cell. We will therefore develop new biosensor designs that greatly reduce cell perturbation. Even the most precise imaging of overlapping molecular activations has not revealed causal relationships. We will therefore adopt the framework of Granger Causality inference, which was originally devised for financial market analysis, to extract causal connections and feedback interactions from imaging data. Numerous steps will be necessary to translate the existing concepts of Granger causality to the analysis of spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes. Most importantly, we will implement a schema for Granger causality inference in multivariate time series models that will capture spatial relations, and we will combine principles of high-dimensional statistical regression with approaches from control theory to estimate information flows between variables that are coupled by strong feedbacks. We will also develop a novel clustering approach that preserves the neighborhood topology of data in a high-dimensional feature space and in the Euclidian space of the cell outline to identify signaling microdomains. Finally, to test and confirm our hypotheses, we will use new photo-activatable and photo-inhibitable analogs of GEFs together with GTPase biosensors to control one protein while observing another. This research plan will produce biosensors with reduced perturbation, biosensor/optogenetic multiplexing capabilities, and image analysis/modeling approaches necessary to shed light on the network topology of nonlinear, spatiotemporally controlled signaling pathways. All tools will efficiently deployed to the community. In this project we are developing new ways to understand the mechanisms by which cells interpret, and in cancer misinterpret, the host of stimuli from outside and inside the cell that determine behavior. We are building molecules that can report, through light emission, the behavior of multiple key elements of the cellular “decision making circuits”, and in parallel developing new mathematical tools to interpret the output of these molecules, and to integrate this data into overall models that reveal information flow in the circuitry. We are also developing the ability to control one circuit component while watching the activity of another, enabling us to dissect out causal relationships within cellular circuits.","Integrated visualization, control, and analysis of GEF – GTPase networks in living cells",10221568,R01CA252826,"['Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biosensor', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'GTP Binding', 'Guanine', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Oncogenic', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visualization', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'computer science', 'control theory', 'design', 'econometrics', 'guanine analog', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'light emission', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical theory', 'migration', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'rho', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'single molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,541157
"Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics ABSTRACT Neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) have been historically categorized into discrete ""types"" based on structure, physiological responses, connectivity patterns, and molecular profiles. Heterogeneity can have other consequences- e.g. recent studies have found that some neuronal types in the retina are more resilient than other types to optic nerve injury, an event that leads to irrecoverable damage in vision. My project combines cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, advanced computational data analysis and molecular tools to define heterogeneity of neuronal types comprehensively, to connect molecular definitions to histology, and explore the functional consequences of this heterogeneity during nerve injury. I will focus on a tractable system, the mouse retina, which communicates visual responses to the brain. It is as complex as any other region of the brain (containing ~120 neuronal types), but benefits from having a compact, accessible structure, and experimental tools make it especially suited for detailed analyses. Building on my previous postdoctoral work, this project will, 1) Complete the census of the mouse retina, which will the first for any CNS region, by inferring molecular taxonomies of two of its most heterogenous classes (amacrines and ganglion cells) from data collected using high-throughput single-cell RNA-sequencing. Using the mouse census, initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, which is harder to access experimentally, but shares important features with humans that are absent in mice. 2) Conduct a systematic investigation of cell-type specific responses in the retina to optic nerve injury. This usually leads to a rapid, stereotypic death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but a recent study by my colleagues reported that some RGC types are more resilient than others. Here, using 1) as a resource, I will identify factors, cell intrinsic and extrinsic, that make these RGC types resilient. 3) Selective resilience of cell types is now recognized as a feature of diseases like glaucoma and stroke. Therapies therefore need to cater to different cell types. To learn more, and derive general principles, I will examine the impact of known therapeutic interventions on the survival of different RGC types, and the underlying molecular responses, within the optic nerve injury model. Taken together, my project will derive substantial molecular information underlying neuronal heterogeneity in the mouse and macaque retina and general principles for cell-type selective resilience following CNS injury in mice. The lessons from this work will provide valuable guidance for similar studies in less accessible regions of the brain (e.g. cerebral cortex).   NARRATIVE The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of a large diversity of neuronal types, a major proportion of which remain to be identified and defined in terms of molecular markers so that their roles in function and dysfunction can be assessed. This project seeks to combine high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, innovative computational and histological methods to comprehensively define neuronal heterogeneity in an accessible system – the mouse retina, and use this as a foundation to (1) initiate a similar mapping of the macaque retina, and (2) study cell-type specific responses in a tractable model of nerve injury (optic nerve crush) to map the resilience of different cell types, and identify molecular correlates underlying these differences. Our work will create transformational tools to address similar challenges in other CNS regions.","Uncovering the molecular identity of retinal cell types, and their responses to nerve injury using single-cell transcriptomics",10132331,R00EY028625,"['Address', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Crush', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Injuries', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'central nervous system injury', 'design', 'ganglion cell', 'human model', 'in vivo', 'injured', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'molecular marker', 'nerve injury', 'neuroprotection', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'retinal ganglion cell regeneration', 'retinal neuron', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'stroke-like episode', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R00,2021,241530
"Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation. We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT). µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues, animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences. In this proposal we will develop a cross-sectional imaging technology termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT) that identifies distinct cells and tissues using intracellular motility signatures, a proxy of cell activity and state. Research will involve conducting a series of experiments in spheroids, animals, and human tissue to understand the nature of the dynamic signal and determine the diagnostic capacity of this technology for distinguishing disease, cell/tissue activity, and response to therapy. We additionally will develop next generation DµOCT technology that will increase resolution, provide more powerful diagnostic algorithms, and enable the use of DµOCT in living patients.",Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping,10221328,R01CA265742,"['3-Dimensional', 'ANXA5 gene', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epithelial', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Necrosis', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phase-Contrast Microscopy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Propidium Diiodide', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast imaging', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdevice', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,619861
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability of our immune system to respond effectively to pathogenic challenge or vaccination depends on a diverse repertoire of Immunoglobulin (Ig) receptors expressed by B lymphocytes. Each B cell receptor (BCR) is unique, having been assembled during lymphocyte development by recombination of germline encoded V(D)J genes. During the course of an immune response, B cells that initially bind antigen with low affinity through their BCR are modified through cycles of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity-dependent selection to produce high-affinity memory and plasma cells. This affinity maturation is a critical component of T cell dependent adaptive immune responses. It helps guard against rapidly mutating pathogens and underlies the basis for many vaccines, but dysregulation can result in autoimmunity and other diseases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our ability to carry out large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) experiments. AIRR-Seq is increasingly being applied to profile BCR repertoires and gain insights into immune responses in healthy individuals and those with a range of diseases, including autoimmunity, infection, allergy, cancer and aging. As NGS technologies improve, these experiments are producing ever larger datasets, with tens- to hundreds-of-millions of BCR sequences. Although promising, repertoire-scale data present fundamental challenges for analysis requiring the development of new techniques and the rethinking of existing methods that are not scalable to the large number of sequences being generated. This proposal describes the development of a series of novel computational methods to explore the central hypothesis that: B cell clonal relationships and lineage structures can be computationally derived from repertoire sequencing data and used to define B cell migration and differentiation networks in health and disease. Specifically, computational methods will be developed to: (Aim 1) identify clonally-related sequences and improve V(D)J gene assignment through determining the Ig locus haplotype, (Aim 2) reconstruct clonal lineages, and use these to learn B cell migration and differentiation networks, and (Aim 3) analyze sequences to predict repertoire properties and sequence motifs that are associated with antigen binding or clinically-relevant outcomes. These through human a combination of simulation-based studies, as (myasthenia gravis) and murine (endogenous methods will be validated well as testing on new experimental data from both retrovirus emergence) systems. Allmethods will be integrated and made available through our widely-used, open-source Immcantation framework, which provides a start-to-finish analytical ecosystem for AIRR-Seq analysis. Together, these methods provide a window into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immunity and the dysregulation that occurs in disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate computational methods to analyze large-scale adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data sets that have become possible with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. The methods development will enable the extraction of new types of information, including immunoglobulin locus haplotypes, as well as B cell migration and differentiation networks. Through quantitative characterization of B cell immunoglobulin repertoires, these methods will provide insights into the micro-evolutionary dynamics that drive adaptive immune responses to infection and vaccination, and the dysregulation that occurs in diseases like autoimmunity.",COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HIGH-THROUGHPUT IMMUNOGLOBULIN SEQUENCING EXPERIMENTS,10075214,R01AI104739,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Cell Receptor Binding', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteria', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cells', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'DNA receptor', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecosystem', 'Endogenous Retroviruses', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Graph', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Invaded', 'Laplacian', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Myasthenia Gravis', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retroviridae', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thymectomy', 'Tissue Differentiation', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high throughput analysis', 'immunoglobulin receptor', 'immunological status', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'method development', 'migration', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'relapse prediction', 'response', 'simulation']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,416371
"Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease SPATIAL EPIGENOMIC PROFILING OF IMMUNE CELL SIGNATURES AT SUBCELLULAR  RESOLUTION IN HEALTH AND DISEASE More than ten percent of childhood cancers are still incurable and need novel therapies. Epigenetic treatments deserve special attention with their specificity and reduced toxicity. Here I plan to explore epigenetic profiles of immune and cancer cells in normal development and blood cancer patients under the mentorship of Garry Nolan for single cell proteomics technology development, in collaboration with Howard Chang for implementation of epigenomic methods such as chromosome accessibility assays, and with Kara Davis for epigenetics studies of treatment resistant B cell subtypes in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Epigenetic measurements have been limited to bulk level sequencing and ligation assays or limited number of imaging markers. To address these limitations, I will use an emerging three dimensional (3D) proteomic imaging technology in individual cells, termed as 3D Multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) or 3D MIBI. Epigenetics research by 3D MIBI benefits from high degree multiplexing (up to 100 markers) and super resolution imaging capability (20 nm x-y; 5 nm z resolution), providing exciting opportunities to study genomic sites, methylated DNA, protein factors, and chromosome accessibility, all within the same experiments in single immune and aberrant (leukemic) cells. To systematically determine epigenetic states, I plan to utilize clonal B cell lines to decipher variability of epigenetic components including chromatin states, protein factors and modifiers by a fifty-marker 3D MIBI panel (Aim 1). These experiments will show distribution of epigenetic factors (linear or log-scale) in their expression levels and spatial variations (global or local) in the chromatin states. I will then perform experiments with primary B cells isolated from six different bone marrow aspirates of normal human subjects (Aim 2). I will correlate epigenetic signatures of each B cell subtype to corresponding development state (progenitor, pre, post, or mature). I will then perform an ex vivo co-culture of primary B cells on OP9 stromal cells over 1-6 weeks of culturing, which will be followed by fixation and profiling by 3D MIBI. These perturbation experiments will show how signaling events from neighboring cells drive necessary epigenetic conditions that are required for reaching a B cell subset. Finally, I will turn to primary B cells that are isolated from twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients (Aim 3). I will dissect differentiation and spatial epigenomic remodeling of responder B cell subsets and treatment resistant B cell subtypes from bone marrow aspirates using the OP9 co-culture. These will show how treatment resistance arises from a single epigenetic state or multiple distinct epigenetic signatures. I will then screen Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on the same co-culture of B cell subtypes from ALL and stromal cells. By varying concentration and duration of inhibition conditions, I will dissect the role of epigenetic drugs in spatial chromatin remodeling toward development of epigenetic therapies in ALL. Together, these experiments will shed light on the role of epigenetic programming for cancer treatment applications from immune cell signatures in normal subjects and blood cancer patients. Public Health Relevance: Epigenetic alterations in immune and cancer cells regulate normal development and aberrant formation in humans. We reveal spatial heterogeneity and dynamic changes in epigenetic states of B cell subtypes from healthy and diseased subjects using a novel multiplex imaging mass cytometry. Deciphering the role of epigenetic perturbations in treatment resistant B cells will guide development of efficient and safe epigenetic therapies for pediatric blood cancers.",Spatial Epigenomic Profiling of Immune Cell Signatures at Subcellular Resolution in Health and Disease,10201436,K25AI140783,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'B-Cell Development', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood Hematopoietic Neoplasm', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Cytometry', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Four-dimensional', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Ligation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Stem cell transplant', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Technology', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'chromatin remodeling', 'design', 'epigenetic drug', 'epigenetic therapy', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging capabilities', 'lymphoblast', 'mathematical analysis', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanometer', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pediatric patients', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'sample fixation', 'shape analysis', 'single cell analysis', 'success', 'technology development', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response']",NIAID,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K25,2021,107880
"Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia Abstract Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with high- risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, HSCT is affected by graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and graft- versus-leukemia (GvL) effects, both are mediated by donor T lymphocytes and significantly impact treatment success and thus overall outcome. AML patients commonly harbor FLT3/internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 that is associated with poor prognosis. FLT3 targeted therapies have proven clinical benefit particularly when used in combinational approaches. Midostaurin (a kinase inhibitor) was recently approved for pre-transplant patients with FLT3-ITD in combination with standard therapy. In addition to their direct leukemia suppressive effects, FLT3 inhibitors activate leukemia antigen-specific T-cell responses. T-cell receptors (TCRs) are proteins expressed on the surface of T cells that recognize antigens presented by MHC molecules. We recently characterized the TCR repertoire in patients who underwent matched donor or haplo-cord HSCT. We demonstrated that GvHD and relapse (exclusive of each other) are associated with lower TCR repertoire diversity and expansion of certain T-cell clones. Our data suggest that individual variations in the immune repertoire significantly impact the clinical outcome in AML patients and underscore the need for comprehensive quantitative, functional, and mechanistic analyses of the TCR repertoire in a large cohort of AML patients. Here, we hypothesize: 1) TCR repertoire (diversity, clonal expansion, and V-segment utilization) affects clinical outcome (GvHD or relapse) and can therefore be used to identify GvL- and GvHD- associated clones; 2) Somatic mutations in leukemic cells (e.g., FLT3-ITD) affect the TCR repertoire and subsequent expansion of specific T-cell clones; and 3) FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin) modulate the TCR repertoire and function and enhance GvL effects in patients undergoing HSCT. We will conduct a prospective longitudinal cohort study characterizing the TCR repertoire and mutational landscape of leukemia cells in ~250 patients (~ 60–80 with FLT3-ITD). GvHD or relapse will be predicted using a proportional hazards model for competing risks based on TCR repertoire characteristics. TCR sequences and somatic mutations will be analyzed using a structure based prediction algorithms we developed to predict candidate leukemia neoantigens and associated TCR clones. Neoantigens will be validated using in vitro and murine models. Finally, functional analyses will examine the effect of midostaurin on TCR repertoire and function. Our findings will establish the TCR repertoire as a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes of HSCT and identify responsible TCR clones. The identification of TCR clones associated with the GvL effect against FLT3-ITD+ cells will facilitate the development of engineered T cells expressing GvL-associated TCR clones. Modifying the TCR repertoire composition via therapies targeting specific somatic mutations will facilitate development of optimized combinational therapeutic approaches, such as the addition of targeted therapy to post-transplant regimens. Narrative: Sparing normal cells while killing leukemic cells (harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia effect) by manipulating alloreactive T cells remains challenging in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only curative approach for patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this proposed research, we leverage genomic and immunogenomic data obtained from patients undergoing HSCT to identify leukemia- specific neoantigens for preclinical investigation as potential therapeutic targets. The knowledge resulting from this proposed research will advance the development of personalized treatments for AML patients.",Leveraging the TCR Repertoire to identify target neoantigens in FLT3-ITD positive Acute Myeloid Leukemia,10120569,R01CA248381,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'Antigens', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Clone Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease remission', 'FDA approved', 'FLT3 gene', 'FLT3 inhibitor', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Immune', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mediating', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective cohort study', 'RNA', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxic', 'disorder risk', 'engineered T cells', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'graft vs host disease', 'graft vs leukemia effect', 'high risk', 'individual variation', 'kinase inhibitor', 'knowledge of results', 'leukemia', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'post-transplant', 'pre-clinical', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'relapse risk', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,379419
"Diet-derived oxysterols shape intestinal B cell fate by controlling intracellular cholesterol metabolism Abstract B lymphocytes in the gastrointestinal tract are constantly stimulated by commensals microbial antigens. In order to prevent commensal outgrowth and maintain intestinal homeostasis, B cells need to mount a rapid antibody response against bacterial antigens. To achieve this task, the humoral immune system relies on a complex multistep process of B cell proliferation and selection in the germinal center, which eventually gives rise to either antibody secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. Intestinal B cells are also exposed to dietary and microbial metabolites during their activation and differentiation, but how these environmental cues shape B cell fate and antibody response in the gut is poorly understood. Therefore, elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that intrinsically regulate the fate and function of individual B cell clones in the gut remains a central question in immunology. Several lines of evidence indicate that metabolic switches act as intrinsic regulators of germinal center B cell response. However, how B cells integrate metabolite sensing with germinal center and antibody response remains undefined to date. In this application we test the hypothesis that the oxysterol 25-HC, an oxidized form of cholesterol, directly controls germinal center B cell response through its interaction with the Sterol Response Element Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2). SREBP2 is a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis, and its transcriptional activity in the intestinal germinal center B cells couples lipid metabolism and B cell differentiation in the intestine. We also hypothesize that follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), stromal cells which are located in the germinal center, produce 25-HC in response to dietary cholesterol and microbiome, therefore linking rapidly changing intestinal homeostasis to B cell fate. Accumulating evidence indicates that 25-HC controls SREBP2 processing, but the implication for this cross talk in B cells in the gut has not been investigated so far. Our aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that SREBP2 activity controls germinal center B cell transcriptional profile and B cell fate; and 2) To define the environmental and cellular cues that regulate 25-HC niche. The proposed studies examine a very poorly understood crosstalk between oxidized form of cholesterol, intestinal metabolism and adaptive immune system activation. It is our expectation that these studies will increase our understanding of how intestinal metabolism shapes B cell responses and adaptive immunity. Furthermore, these studies will provide a foundation for better understanding of the relationship between lipid metabolism and differentiation in immune cells. Narrative Intestinal humoral response occurs in an environment exposed to multiple metabolic stimuli, from both diet and commensal bacteria. We identified the transcription factor SREBP2 as a potential key regulator of germinal center response. Oxysterols, oxidized forms of cholesterol, have been shown to control SREBP2 activation and transcription activity. This proposal aims to identify the mechanisms by which SREBP2 shapes germinal center B cell differentiation in antibody-secreting plasma cells and to map oxysterol niche and its extrinsic requirements.

"Functional and transcriptional analysis of embryonic hematopoietic stem cell development at the single cell level PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The therapeutic potential of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) could be significantly enhanced by methods to generate HSC de novo from pluripotent stem cells (PSC) or reprogrammed adult cells. Thus, there has been great interest in understanding the embryologic origin of HSC and the signal pathways that guide HSC development and self-renewal, such that the process of HSC genesis can be recapitulated in vitro, a goal which has yet to be realized. Given the heterogeneity and developmental asynchrony in hemogenic precursors during their emergence in the embryo, to achieve this it will be necessary to develop better strategies to isolate and characterize the rare precursors capable of giving rise to HSC and to understand the signals that drive their development to functional, engrafting HSC. To this end, I have established that endothelial cells (EC) derived from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region (AGM), the niche in which the first HSC emerge, can promote the in vitro specification and self-renewal of engrafting HSC from hemogenic precursors, including recent studies at the single cell level. Furthermore, I have shown that the Notch pathway functions in both specification and self-renewal of HSC in the EC niche, and that use of immobilized Notch ligands to activate the Notch pathway, along with hematopoietic cytokines, is sufficient to induce expansion of embryonic HSC. Building upon this work, the goals of this proposal are to utilize this novel in vitro AGM-EC system to elucidate the phenotypic, molecular, and functional properties of HSC precursors as they transition to functional HSC capable of long-term, multilineage engraftment. This will require isolation and functional characterization of HSC precursors across different stages of their development at the single cell level (Aim 1), followed by single cell transcriptional analysis to determine the gene regulatory networks and molecular signals promoting their development to functional HSC (Aim 2A). In studies working toward the engineering of stromal cell-free systems for HSC generation, agonists of identified signaling pathways will be functionally tested for their capacity to support HSC development in conjunction with the known requirement for Notch signaling activation (Aim 2B). Altogether, these studies will provide novel insight into the unique properties of HSC precursors, as well at the signaling mechanisms governing their maturation to functional HSC, which will have important implications in advancing our ability to generate HSC from PSC. To accomplish these aims, I will leverage the wealth of resources available in the mentoring laboratory of Dr. Bernstein, as well as key resources available at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital, and opportunities for co-mentorship from Dr. Shahin Rafii at the Ansary Stem Cell Institute at Weill Cornell Medical College. A key aspect of my career development plan is to also acquire new skills that will facilitate my research objectives, including techniques in single cell RNA-seq and bioinformatics analysis which will be performed in collaboration with and under the co-mentorship of Dr. Cole Trapnell in Genome Sciences at the University of Washington. This type of interdisciplinary training will provide me with the tools necessary to apply innovative technologies in unravelling the complexity of niche- stem cell interactions that instruct HSC fates. My research experience studying hematopoietic stem cell development has provided me with a strong background to facilitate success in the proposed research goals. My clinical experience in caring for children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has cemented a strong passion to expand scientific knowledge of HSC and translate this knowledge to improve therapies for children with hematologic, immunologic, and oncologic diseases. Success in my research and career development goals outlined in this proposal will enable me to establish an independent academic career as a physician-scientist with the skills to lead a diverse research team and collaborate broadly to address essential questions in stem cell biology. Ultimately, my long-term goal is to develop a laboratory-based career with focus on taking fundamental principles discovered through basic research in developmental HSC biology toward clinical applications in hematopoietic stem cell therapeutics.

"Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal for a K08 Award is motivated by two overarching goals: 1) to support the scientific and professional development of the candidate, Dr. Paul Reyfman, towards achieving his career goal of succeeding as a physician scientist and independent investigator with expertise in systems biology approaches applied to the study of chronic lung disease, and 2) to investigate whether single-cell transcriptomic profiling can provide novel insights into the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a deadly and progressive condition for which diagnostic approaches remain imprecise and effective therapies are lacking. Together with his mentors, Drs. Scott Budinger and Luís Amaral, the candidate has developed a comprehensive training plan that will ensure Dr. Reyfman acquires new knowledge and proficiencies in developing hypotheses, designing and completing experiments, analyzing data, and communicating findings to the scientific community. As an essential component of this training plan, the candidate will employ systems biology approaches to developing tools for analysis of single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated from patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling is increasingly used to investigate the pathobiology of disease in humans and as a basis for developing novel biomarkers of disease. Developing and validating tools for analyzing the rapidly growing quantity of single-cell transcriptomic data is as much of a challenge as refining techniques for generating data from healthy and diseased tissues. In particular, it is not known whether analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) data can be used to quantify accurately the cellular composition of the lung and to identify gene expression differences between health and pulmonary fibrosis. Our preliminary data suggest that scRNA-Seq of lung identifies profibrotic gene expression in patients with pulmonary fibrosis that is heterogeneous between individuals. We also found that scRNA-Seq undersampled certain constituent lung cellular populations. Accordingly, we designed this proposal to test the hypothesis that single-cell transcriptomic analysis of lung samples from patients with pulmonary fibrosis can be used to identify disease endotypes. In Specific Aim 1, the candidate will determine whether snRNA-Seq enables quantification of the cellular composition of the lung during pulmonary fibrosis. In Specific Aim 2, the candidate will develop tools for using scRNA-Seq performed on specimens obtained from patients with SSc-ILD and normal controls to gain novel insights into disease pathobiology. Over the course of this award, the candidate will gain new skills including in generating snRNA-Seq from cryopreserved lung tissue, in lung stereology, in RNA in situ hybridization, in analysis of complementary genomic datasets, and in incorporation of clinical phenotypic information into genomic analyses. Accomplishing the proposed work will provide a rigorous training program for Dr. Reyfman and will provide insights that could lead to improved therapies for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The studies outlined in this proposal will be essential for future investigations that employ systems biology approaches to investigate the pathobiology of pulmonary fibrosis or to develop novel biomarkers of disease. This proposal will deepen our understanding of the strengths and limitations of single-cell transcriptomic profiling technology for studying human lung samples during health and disease. These findings may form a foundation for the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of response to therapy in pulmonary fibrosis, and may uncover new targets for therapy.",Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis to Identify Drivers of Pulmonary Fibrosis,10112301,K08HL146943,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alveolar', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue Diseases', 'Cryopreservation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Donor person', 'Drug Exposure', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung Compliance', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized approach', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K08,2021,162792
"Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection PROJECT SUMMARY The overall purpose of this proposal is to develop predictive biomarkers of treatment outcome in kidney transplant rejection, specifically in T-cell mediated rejection (TCMR), as the response to treatment can be variable, is currently not predictable by clinical diagnostics nor understood from a mechanistic sense, and even partial treatment failure is associated with shortened graft longevity. In each aim, we make use of residual diagnostic biopsy samples with paired richly-detailed clinical data and timelines including treatments, graft functional responses and outcomes. In this manner, we track along the clinical timeline of TCMR, with each aim addressing an unsolved clinical problem in the field. Through the same approach, experimental data from this unique “model system” of tissue inflammation studied over time provides a rich discovery set for understanding tissue-resident T cell behavior in the human kidney. Aim 1 looks at the whole transcriptome profiles of initial acute episodes of TCMR prior to treatment, to identify a gene expression signature predictive of resistance/sensitivity to standard therapies for rejection. When treatment fails, grafts frequently contain residual T cell infiltrates, but the causal connection between these cells and long- term outcome is unclear. For example, residual infiltrates may represent (i) contracting/egressing populations of T cells effectively treated, (ii) newly recruited T cells mounting a fresh rejection response where repeat therapy may be prudent, or (iii) scant memory T cells with established tissue posts and capable of inciting repeat inflammation. Therefore, in Aim 2, we focus on post-treatment biopsies of treatment failure, characterizing multiple spatio-phenotypic aspects of the T cell infiltrate by high dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy with digital image processing and quantitative spatial analysis, to determine which functional phenotypic T cell subsets in which specific tissue niches, correlate with poor graft outcomes. These complementary but independent aims will be achieved through established cross-disciplinary collaborations and with partial industry support. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney transplantation is life saving and compared to dialysis improves patient quality of life and decreases healthcare costs over time, but graft longevity is compromised by immunologic rejection and inadequate immunosuppression. Timely appropriate therapy for rejection can preserve graft longevity, but biomarkers to predict response to therapy are lacking, leading some centers to over-treat, putting patients at risk of infection and malignancy, while clinical protocols at other centers may under-treat, putting patients at risk of accelerated graft decline. Therefore, development of tests to guide appropriate selection of therapy for rejection would be clinically useful, and discovery-based platforms for biomarker identification have the potential to yield not only clinically useful tests but also to reveal biologic mechanisms of treatment resistance and potential new targets for therapy.",Predictive biomarkers of treatment response in kidney transplant rejection,10128898,R21AI151491,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Allografting', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Epidemiology', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Failure', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunologics', 'Immunosuppression', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Steroid Resistance', 'Steroids', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'biomarker identification', 'cell behavior', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'graft function', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'human tissue', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'kidney allograft', 'migration', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,266691
"Elucidating Genotype-Phenotype Relationship of Polygenic Dilated Cardiomyopathies PROJECT SUMMARY Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a genetic cardiac disorder with high morbidity and an incidence of 1:250. Although generally thought of as a disease with monogenic heritability, recent genetic studies suggest complex polygenic causes. Functional profiles of polygenic cardiomyopathies are poorly understood and this hampers effective therapeutics development. Recent advances in stem cell technology such as patient- derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and genome-editing, provides an unprecedented opportunity to study such disease phenotypes. Cardiomyocytes will be differentiated from iPSCs taken from patients with two DCM related mutations and sequenced to understand transcriptome differences that may correlate with disease susceptibility. The analysis will be normalized by using CRISPR to create isogenic controls and also insert the mutations in healthy individuals that are related to these patients. We will then utilize the iPSC platform coupled with tissue engineering to develop engineered heart tissues composed of cardiac specific cells. We will perform single cell RNA sequencing to test the cell-cell interactions and crosstalk between the cells. We will also perform functional assays like calcium-handling and contractility. CRISPR/dCas9 systems will allow us to identify genes suitable for drug targeting. The overarching goal of the parent R01 grant is to understand underlying mechanisms of polygenic DCM using the iPSC platform. The proposed diversity supplement extends this work by studying patients of different ethnicities and considering how this factors in disease severity. African-American and Hispanic patients are underrepresented in health studies, and therefore more vulnerable to poor disease management. Dr. Carlos Vera will expand our cohort of 20 individuals by six iPSC lines derived from these minority populations and perform the proposed set of experiments. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic dilated cardiomyopathy is an inherited form of cardiac disease where multiple genes relating to muscle function carry mutations that lead to reduced function. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) derived from patients and differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) are an indispensable new tool to study pathological signatures when coupled to genomics, cellular biology, and tissue engineering. Through the parent grant and this diversity supplement, we aim to study the pathology manifested in different patients, including ones typically underrepresented in genetic studies like African Americans and Latinos and consider how much ethnicity plays a role in severity.",Elucidating Genotype-Phenotype Relationship of Polygenic Dilated Cardiomyopathies,10359919,R01HL130020,"['African American', 'Appointment', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Dilated Cardiomyopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heritability', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Inherited', 'Internet', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Puerto Rico', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Study Skills', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Training', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'Writing', 'biophysical analysis', 'biophysical properties', 'bioprocess', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'career', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'college', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome editing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'medical specialties', 'neutrophil', 'online course', 'parent grant', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'protein purification', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell technology', 'summer research', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'undergraduate student', 'wound healing']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,121848
"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity. We anticipate that our study will bring forth significant advances not only in deep learning methodology but also in precision medicine. This project aims to develop advance machine learning methods, referred to as deep learning models, to simulate cellular signaling systems, at both multiple cell and single cell levels. Success of these models will enable researchers to investigate cellular behaviors under physiological and pathological condition, and such information can be used to guide therapy of cancer patients.",Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine,10171908,R01LM012011,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'chemical genetics', 'data modeling', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,309404
"Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development Project Summary Congenital birth defects affect an estimated 3% of live births. To develop effective treatment strategies, a thorough understanding of early human development is necessary. Our lab recently developed and in vitro model of human gastrulation, the process by which the three germ layers (endoderm, ectoderm, mesoderm) are formed around week three of gestation. This so-called “gastruloid” model is formed by treating human embryonic stem cells with purified differentiation factors that cause them to self-organize into a pattern resembling a gastrulating embryo. One of the key events during this process is formation of the primitive streak—a migration of specialized mesenchymal stem cells along the embryonic midline that will form all mesodermal tissues including the heart, lungs, blood vessels, and cells of the circulatory system. At the same time, cells on the periphery of the embryo begin forming extraembryonic mesoderm, which will ultimately become placental tissue. Despite the critical importance of these cell fate changes, it is currently unclear which population of embryonic stem cells will differentiate to form primitive streak or extraembryonic mesoderm and how these cell fate decisions are determined. The research objective of this fellowship proposal is to understand when and how human stem cells differentiate into primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm during gastrulation. My overall approach is to use time-lapse fluorescence imaging to monitor differentiation decisions in real time and at single-cell solution. I will then employ a specialized type of machine learning known as deep learning to accurately track the movement and signaling behavior of individual cells. Next, I will develop a computational model that uses a cell’s image patterns to accurately predict how each cell “chooses” between differentiation fates. The two specific research aims are: 1) to identify the subpopulation of human embryonic stem cells that will commit to primitive streak; and 2) to determine the combination of intracellular and extracellular signaling events that govern differentiation to extraembryonic mesoderm. The proposed work includes novel experimental procedures (specifically, real-time imaging of gastruloids formation in Aim 1) as well as unique neural network architectures that accurately predict binary cell fate outcomes of individual stem cells based on their signaling history. These methods will be generalizable to other biological systems. The proposed training plan focuses on generating and applying cutting-edge statistical methods tasked with full single-cell feature data incorporation in order to make robust, theoretically and biologically sound predictions about human stem cell fate decisions. A better understanding of early human development will inform future cellular therapies to prevent and treat congenital birth defects. To support my training, I have assembled a strong mentorship team with expertise in stem cell biology, live-cell imaging, machine learning methodologies, and causal inference. Project Narrative Early human development is a crucial time period in which the structures of primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm are formed and errors in cellular differentiation can have dire consequences. This fellowship proposal seeks to advance our fundamental understanding of how human embryonic stem cells decide specific differentiation fates using advanced machine learning methodologies. The findings from this work will help develop future stem cell therapies for treatment of birth defects and miscarriages in early primitive streak and extraembryonic mesoderm formation, ultimately improving public health.",Deep learning models to predict primitive streak formation in human development,10141600,F31HL156464,"['Affect', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brachyury protein', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Differential Equation', 'Ectoderm', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endoderm', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Live Birth', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mesoderm', 'Mesoderm Cell', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Primitive Streaks', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'blastomere structure', 'bone morphogenetic protein 4', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'daughter cell', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'embryonic stem cell', 'extracellular', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gastrulation', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human imaging', 'human model', 'human stem cells', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'live cell imaging', 'migration', 'molecular marker', 'movie', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'pluripotency', 'precursor cell', 'prevent', 'real-time images', 'recurrent neural network', 'repaired', 'self organization', 'self-renewal', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell fate', 'stem cell therapy', 'stem cells', 'time use', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2021,37550
"Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA Abstract  Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. cfDNA is fragmented with sizes centered around 145bp and 166bp which is approximately the length of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome, and a nucleosome plus its linker, respectively. Shorter fragments (30-100bp) also exist and have a clear periodicity of 10bp, corresponding to a turn of the DNA helix wrapped around the core histone. Recent reports have shown that the fragmentation sizes of cfDNA are tissue specific, which is a product of distinct nucleosome spacing that is inherent in the function of individual tissues. When these individual fragments are compared with existing epigenetic data from tissues, they can be binned into cell of origin simply based on whether they reveal the nucleosome positioning information of the originating tissue. Identifying cfDNA fragments of placental origin from maternal circulation would provide a non-invasive means of assessing placental function during human pregnancy.  Several major barriers inhibit cfDNA as a non-invasive method for examining placental function: 1) the ability to accurately identify the placental origin of the short <160bp cfDNA fragments that constitute regulatory information (paternal SNPs occur at frequency of approximately 1/2000bp). 2) the ability to use these fragments to piece together precise epigenetic states of the placenta. 3) the cost of deep whole genome sequencing that has traditionally been required to deconvolute epigenetic profiles of admixed cellular origins. Our goal is to overcome each of these barriers by exploiting state-of-the-art genomics and machine learning techniques to extract precise information about human placental function from cfDNA. We will first compile robust and accurate nucleosome information, including epigenetic and transcription factor occupancy, from the human placenta and then we will establish machine-learning platforms to elucidate placental cfDNA from maternal circulation at low cost. Success in this project will enable earlier intervention for high-risk pregnancies and facilitate the longitudinal, non-invasive real-time monitoring of pregnancy progression, thereby informing adaptive treatment decision-making. Narrative Circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics, but this is the tip of the iceberg, as cfDNA fragmentation patterns embed epigenetic footprints indicative of cell of origin, cellular function and pathological state. Out goal is to develop technology to utilize cfDNA as means to assess placental function non-invasively.",Molecular images and machine learning to extract placental function from maternal cfDNA,10114907,R01HD094513,"['ATAC-seq', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Size', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chorionic Villi Sampling', 'DNA', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Frequencies', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'High-Risk Pregnancy', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Placenta', 'Placental Extracts', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Reporting', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visual', 'base', 'cell free DNA', 'complex data', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'deep learning algorithm', 'denoising', 'epigenome', 'genome sequencing', 'image processing', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network algorithm', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'real time monitoring', 'success', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,591753
"Machine learning with immunogenetics for the prediction of hematopoietic cell transplant outcomes ABSTRACT Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is the only curative treatment for most forms of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), but its 50% failure rate remains unacceptably high, with the principal causes of death due to disease relapse and graft-versus-host disease. When successful, HCT prevents leukemic relapse due to a graft versus leukemia effect, co-mediated by T cell and natural killer (NK) cell immune functions. Selection of donors whose allografts will provide higher NK anti-leukemic response potential but low GVHD risk remains a major unmet need in HCT.  The polygenic, polymorphic KIR receptors, in combination with their HLA ligands, control NK function, dictating NK repertoire content and establishing thresholds for NK cell response in a process called “NK education”. Large retrospective studies in HCT have demonstrated that specific KIR-HLA allele combinations associated with NK education are predictive for relapse control, but they represent only a fraction of known KIR-HLA interactions. Furthermore, out of the thousands of phenotypes present in the NK repertoire, the NK population(s) responsible for leukemia control in HCT is unknown and they likely differ between transplant pairs. Aim 1 proposes a machine learning approach to integrate NK genotype, phenotype, and function to identify how genotype determines overall repertoire response and which subpopulations contribute most to global response. Parallel statistical modeling of NK genotypes and HCT outcome in a cohort of 2800 AML patient may confirm the same genotypes that are potent for global response also play a role in HCT outcomes but may also identify unexpected ones.  HLA is the most important determinant of GVHD risk. Precise HLA matching lowers the risk for GVHD, but for patients who lack HLA-compatible donors, predicting permissible HLA mismatches is a paramount and unmet need. Two lineages of HLA-B allotypes exist based on the M and T leader peptide dimorphism, and GVHD risk in HLA-mismatched HCT differs depending on the match status of the leader. The division of the HLA-B locus into two lineages provides a novel approach for mapping functional motifs in transplantation that removes reduces the sheer numbers of polymorphic positions that previously precluded examination of more than 1 residue at a time. Machine learning approaches using HLA data from more than 11,000 transplant patients will permit assessment of the full spectrum of lineage variation and the relationship between T-cell and NK alloresponses. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed study is to determine how two different immune cells, known as natural killer cells and T cells, work to recognize cancer cells and cause destruction of healthy tissues in patients receiving a bone marrow transplant.

"Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level Project Summary/Abstract Cell migration is required for many important physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. As a process that involves concerted action of multiple ensembles of molecules over the length of the entire cell, cell migration cannot be understood using conventional molecular approaches alone without considering sensing, actuation, and control at the whole cell level. This project seeks to approach migrating cells in a top-down manner as an integrated mechanochemical system. Based on observations that likely represent the manifestation of a complex network of molecular interactions, we may deduct how the underlying machine operates. The project will be facilitated by the development of new technologies, including 3D printing of polyacrylamide hydrogels and machine learning for cell tracking, traction force microscopy, and super resolution imaging. We will address three important aspects. First, we will ask how cells initiate migration through a process known as symmetry breaking, which causes a symmetrically spreading cell to initiate directional migration. We will examine various anisotropic properties of the substrate as potential symmetry breaking cues. In addition, the function of filopodia as possible sensors for symmetry breaking will be studied with imaging and pharmacological approaches. Second, we will address several poorly understood aspects of 2D and 3D cell migration. By following migrating cells over a long distance at a high magnification, we expect to place the newly discovered process of contact following in the context of cell collectives. To understand how cell shape control, cell-cell interaction, and cell migration respond to 3D environment, we will use 3D printed polyacrylamide to create model systems and systematically vary geometrical and mechanical parameters. We will then extend the experiments to decellularized lung scaffolds, which have been used for tissue engineering, to determine how migration characteristics in 3D is related to the promotion of tissue formation. Another overlooked area we will examine is the function of the tail in defining cell polarity and mediating contact following. Third, we will seek mechanistic understanding of cellular responses to cyclic stretching, which occurs in various tissues. A novel imaging approach will allow us to determine the responses during the stretching and relaxation phase respectively. A combination of experimentation and computer modeling is planned to explain why epithelial cells respond to static stretching along the direction of forces but perpendicularly in response to cyclic stretching. We will also test the hypothesis that responses to cyclic stretching can cause cell intercalation, a fundamentally important process in embryonic morphogenesis. We expect our results to complement studies at the molecular level and bring paradigm shifting insights into cell migration for both basic cell biology and repair of tissue functions. Project Narrative This project seeks to fill important gaps of knowledge in cell migration, which is essential for many physiological and pathological processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, and cancerous invasion. We will use a top-down approach that treats migrating cells as an integrated mechanical system, and we are developing technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence for fabricating experimental environments, following cell movements, and imaging interactions in 3D scaffolds. Knowledge in how migrating cells interact with the environment and with each other is expected to further our abilities to counter diseases and restore body functions.",Dissecting the mechanism of cell migration at the systems level,10153827,R35GM136345,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Polarity', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Filopodia', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relaxation', 'Resolution', 'Stretching', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Traction Force Microscopy', 'base', 'cell motility', 'experimental study', 'imaging approach', 'insight', 'intercalation', 'migration', 'new technology', 'novel', 'polyacrylamide', 'polyacrylamide hydrogels', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensor', 'tissue repair', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,339635
"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk.

"Developing computational algorithms for histopathological image analysis Project Summary  Histopathology is the cornerstone of disease diagnosis and prognosis. With the advance of imaging technology, whole-slide image (WSI) scanning of tissue slides is becoming a routine clinical procedure and producing a massive amount of data that captures histopathological details in high resolution. Most current pathological image analysis methods, similar to general image analysis approaches, mainly focus on morphology features, such as tissue texture and granularity, but ignore the complex hierarchical structures of tissues. Cells are the fundamental building blocks to tissues. Different types of cells are first organized into cellular components, which together with the extracellular matrix, form different types of tissue architectures. Understanding the interactions among these different types of cells can provide critical insights into biology and disease status. However, there are some major computational challenges: (1) How to identify and classify different types of cells in tissue, (2) how to characterize the highly complex and heterogeneous spatial organization of tissue, and (3) how to integrate histopathology data with other types of data to study disease status and progression. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel computational methods to analyze histopathology image data to study disease status and progression. In order to achieve this goal, we have built a strong research team with complementary expertise in image analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and clinical pathology. Specifically, we will develop novel algorithms to: (1) classify different types of cells from histopathology tissue WSI scans, (2) characterize and quantify cell spatial distribution and cell-cell interactions, and (3) integrate histopathology data with other types data to study disease progression. All proposed methods were motivated by real-world biological and clinical applications across different types of diseases, such as liver diseases, infectious diseases, and cancer. If implemented successfully, the proposed study will facilitate the analysis and modeling of data generated from histopathology tissue slides to improve disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and outcome prediction.

"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the refined methods and new results provided by our research will be directly useful for the research community as they hunt for ways to prevent or treat mental disorders.",Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data,10144504,R01MH123184,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'critical developmental period', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychogenetics', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505168
"Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools. PROJECT SUMMARY Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare melanoma subtype with an estimated annual incidence of approximately 2000 in the United States. While most patients have excellent rates of local disease control with surgery or radiotherapy, nearly half develop metastatic disease, most frequently to the liver. Metastatic UM (MUM) is very treatment resistant and shows no significant responses to conventional chemotherapies or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). UM is molecularly characterized by canonical mutations of the Gα protein subunits (GNAQ/11), which result in hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway. Targeting this pathway with MEK inhibitors (MEKi) results in significant anti-tumor activity in vitro, and response rates of up to 14% in patients with MUM, thereby exhibiting significantly higher activity compared to other available systemic therapies. However, there remains significant potential to improve the efficacy of MEKi. To better define modifiers of MEKi sensitivity and resistance, it is important to consider the fact that most UM harbor mutually exclusive GNAQ/11co-mutations, including inactivating mutations or bi-allelic loss of BAP1 (~33%) or deleterious mutations in SF3B1 (~23%) or EIF1AX (13%), thus define distinct genomic subtypes of UM. These alterations likely provide dependencies that are not abrogated with MEKi alone, yet they may represent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities in the context of MEKi. Furthermore, there has not been a systematic evaluation of how MEKi (or any other therapy) alters cancer cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms that could confer drug resistance. This is in part due to technical barriers and lack of in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate human MUM. In this proposal, we build on several innovations to systematically determine the impact of MEKi on the MUM ecosystem and define synthetic lethal dependencies across the UM genomic landscape and in the context of MEKi. We will achieve this in two specifim aims: In Aim 1, we will perform single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) in patients with MUM who underwent therapy with MEKi selumetinib and had serial biopsies (pre-, on- and off-therapy), and analyze these with several established analytical methods. Second, building on recent developments, we will build machine learning tools for the analysis of sequential single-cell data sets. In Aim 2, we will perform patient- informed CRISPR-screens with multi-modal single-cell RNA/protein readouts across the genomic spectrum of UM. Finally, we will perform genome-scale CRISPR-screens across multiple models to define genotype-shared and -unique modifiers of MEKi responses. Together, these approaches will provide the a comprehensive sequential single-cell analysis in solid tumors, develop tools for temporal single-cell analyses that can be referenced against a ground truth, and define genotype-dependent synthetic lethal vulnerabilities with concurrent MEKi therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Uveal melanoma (UM) is a rare form of melanoma that metastasizes in 50% of affected patients, which is associated with treatment resistance poor survival. There is currently no Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)- approved therapy for patients with metastatic UM, but MEK inhibitors (MEKi) are promising. Here, we will use a broad spectrum of single-cell genomic, genome-editing and machine-learning tools to define drug resistance to MEKi and potential synthetic lethal vulnerabilities across the distinct genomic landscape of UM.","Dissecting drug resistance in serial uveal melanoma biopsies using integrated, multi-modal single-cell profiling and novel machine learning tools.",10290692,R21CA263381,"['Affect', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Biopsy', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cues', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Freezing', 'GNAQ gene', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Liver', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK Signaling Pathway Pathway', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Radiation therapy', 'Resistance', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Uveal Melanoma', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'chemotherapy', 'combinatorial', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'molecular subtypes', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prospective', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2021,189338
"Stanford Tissue Mapping Center HuBMAP Supplemental Research Proposal Overview We are requesting supplemental funds for two items:  1. Development of a new computational tool based on a recently developed deep-learning network called  ORCA to use spatial features with single-cell expression data from CODEX to more accurately transfer  cell type annotations to unlabeled CODEX datasets (50% funds are requested to fund a member from  Prof. Jure Leskovec from Computer Science at Stanford University to join our efforts at the Stanford  TMC). This tool has already been used to transfer cell type annotations to unlabeled HuBMAP donor  small intestine and large intestine single cell CODEX data, already saving nearly 100 hours of  annotations required for annotating 2 donors datasets, yet does not incorporate spatial annotations to  help with cell type annotations.  2. An EvoSep Liquid Chromatography system (50% funds are requested) for scProteomics. It is one of the  few systems which can run a true low nano flow rate gradient ( <100 nl/min). Low nano flow can  dramatically improve sensitivity which is the key for the success of scProteomics using mass spectrometry. We will develop a new deep-learning network called ORCA to use spatial features within CODEX data to accurately assign cell type labels to unannotated CODEX datasets saving hundreds of hours of manual annotation. We will also use an EvoSep Liquid Chromatography system to improve our sensitivity for scProteomics for our future small intestine and colon samples.",Stanford Tissue Mapping Center,10414673,U54HG010426,"['Cells', 'Colon', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Label', 'Large Intestine', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Research Proposals', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Small Intestines', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'base', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'learning network', 'member', 'nano', 'success', 'tool']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,100000
"Deciphering the building blocks of hippocampal circuits   Abstract   Since  Ramon  y  Cajal,  neuroscientists  have  speculated  that  even  the  most  complex  brain  functions  might  eventually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. Unfortunately, our under‐ standing of the brain's extensive diversity of cell types and elaborate circuitry remains far from complete. For  example, despite the hippocampus being essential for learning and memory and its dysfunction underlying a  wide variety of devastating neuropsychiatric disorders, we still lack fundamental knowledge about its constit‐ uent cell types and their molecular profiles and connectivity, slowing progress towards a mechanistic circuit‐ level understanding of memory formation. We propose to identify all of the interneuron cell types in area CA1  of the hippocampus and decipher their canonical connectivity. We have assembled a strong interdisciplinary  team  capable  of  combining  cutting‐edge  technologies  including  high‐throughput  multi‐cell  patch  recordings,  morphological reconstructions, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and machine learning to achieve two main goals:  1) dissect CA1 microcircuit organization by generating a morphological and electrophysiological taxonomy of  all interneuron cell types in mouse CA1 and map their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of  morphologically defined CA1 interneurons using our newly developed Patch‐seq method. Our team recently  implemented  this  interdisciplinary  experimental  strategy  to  successfully  identify  cell  types  in  the  neocortex  and dissect their microcircuitry. Using multi‐cell patch clamp recording, we will characterize the electrophysi‐ ological properties, morphology, laminar location and connectivity of thousands of neurons from mouse CA1  hippocampus. We will also utilize a new, highly sensitive, cost effective technique for single‐cell RNA sequenc‐ ing (Smart‐seq2) to map their transcriptomes and machine learning techniques to classify cells into molecular  types.  Importantly,  our  high‐throughput  method  will  allow  us  to  obtain  morphological,  electrophysiological  and  complete  transcriptome  information  for  single  neurons,  which  cannot  be  achieved  using  other  methods  such as dissociating tissue for single‐cell sequencing. In‐house customization and automation has reduced our  sequencing costs, enabling us to sequence thousands of cells within a reasonable budget. Cell type identifica‐ tion will be validated using morphological, electrophysiological, and molecular tests. Identifying all of the in‐ terneuron  cell  types  that  comprise  CA1  and  determining  how  they  connect  to  each  other  will  have  a  broad,  paradigm‐shifting impact. For instance, it will contribute to a circuit‐level understanding of the computations  that take place in CA1, such as memory formation. From a clinical perspective, single‐cell transcriptome data  will yield a powerful atlas to investigate relationships between cell types and genes related to neuropsychiatric  diseases and facilitate cell‐type engineering.       Narrative  The  hippocampus  is  a  complex  brain  structure  that  mediates  remarkable  mental  functions  like  learning  and  memory, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including Alzheimer's  disease, schizophrenia, depression, and temporal lobe epilepsy. For more than a century, neuroscientists have  marveled  at  the  extensive  diversity  of  neuronal  cell  types  that  comprise  the  hippocampus  and  other  brain  structures,  yet  we  still  know  very  little  about  their  identity  and  how  they  are  wired  together  to  mediate  information processing in the brain. We propose a novel research approach that will enable us to identify the  different  interneuron  cell  types  in  the  CA1  region  of  the  hippocampus  and  determine  their  connectivity  diagram,  which  will  lead  to  a  better  circuit‐level  understanding  of  hippocampal  function  and  more  effective

"A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images Abstract  The ability of accurate localize and characterize cells in light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) image is indispensable for shedding new light on the understanding of three dimensional structures of the whole brain. In our previous work, we have successfully developed a 2D nuclear segmentation method for the nuclear cleared microscopy images using deep learning techniques. Although the convolutional neural networks show promise in segmenting cells in LSFM images, our previous work is confined in 2D segmentation scenario and suffers from the limited number of annotated data. In this project, we aim to develop a high throughput 3D cell segmentation engine, with the focus on improving the segmentation accuracy and generality. First, we will develop a cloud based semi-automatic annotation platform using the strength of virtual reality (VR) and crowd sourcing. The user-friendly annotation environment and stereoscopic view in VR can significantly improve the efficiency of manual annotation. We design a semi-automatic annotation workflow to largely reduce human intervention, and thus improve both the accuracy and the replicability of annotation across different users. Enlightened by the spirit of citizen science, we will extend the annotation software into a crowd sourcing platform which allows us to obtain a massive number of manual annotations in short time. Second, we will develop a fully 3D cell segmentation engine using 3D convolutional neural networks trained with the 3D annotated samples. Since it is often difficult to acquire isotropic LSFM images, we will further develop a super resolution method to impute a high resolution image to facilitate the 3D cell segmentation. Third, we will develop a transfer learning framework to make our 3D cell segmentation engine general enough to the application of novel LSFM data which might have significant gap of image appearance due to different imaging setup or clearing/staining protocol. This general framework will allow us to rapidly develop a specific cell segmentation solution for new LSFM data with very few or even no manual annotations, by transferring the existing 3D segmentation engine that has been trained with a sufficient number of annotated samples. Fourth, we will apply our computational tools to several pilot neuroscience studies: (1) Investigating how topoisomerase I (one of the autism linked transcriptional regulators) regulates brain structure, and (2) Investigating genetic influence on cell types in the developing human brain by quantifying the number of progenitor cells in fetal cortical tissue. Successful carrying out our project will have wide-reaching impact in neuroscience community in visualizing and analyzing complete cellular resolution maps of individual cell types within healthy and disease brain. The improved cell segmentation engine in 3D allows scientists from all over the world to share and process each other’s data accurately and efficiently, thus increasing reproducibility and power. Project Narrative This proposal aims to develop a next generation cell segmentation engine for the whole brain tissue cleared images. Our proposed work is built upon our previous 2D nuclear segmentation project using deep learning techniques. However, we found that our current computational tool is limited in 2D segmentation scenario and insufficient of annotated training samples. To address these limitations, we will first develop a cloud-based semi-automatic annotation tool with the capacity of virtual reality. Our annotation tool is designed to be cross- platform, which allows us to partner with “SciStarter” (the largest citizen science projects in the world) and acquire large amount of cell annotations from the science enthusiastic volunteers. Meanwhile, we will develop next generation 3D cell segmentation engine using an end-to-end fully connected convolution neural network. To facilitate 3D cell segmentation, we will also develop a super resolution method to impute an isotropic high- resolution image from a low-resolution microscopy image. After the development of 3D cell segmentation engine, we will continue to improve its generality by developing a transfer learning framework which enables us to rapidly deploy our 3D cell segmentation engine to the novel microscopy images without the time-consuming manual annotation step. Finally, we will apply our segmentation tool to visualize and quantify brain structure differences within genetically characterized mouse and human brain tissue at UNC neuroscience center. In the end of this project, we will release the software (both binary program and source code) and the 3D cell annotations, in order to facilitate the similar neuroscience studies in other institutes. Considering the importance of high throughput computational tools in quantifying three dimensional brain structure, this cutting- edge technique will be very useful in neuroscience research community.",A Scalable Platform for Exploring and Analyzing Whole Brain Tissue Cleared Images,10244882,R01NS110791,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anecdotes', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source Code', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Type I DNA Topoisomerases', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fetal', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'programs', 'stem cells', 'stereoscopic', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality', 'volunteer']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,335104
"Phenotypic Screening for Longevity Interventions Using Single-cell Epigenetic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in understanding the biology of aging have raised the prospect of drug interventions to promote healthy aging in humans. However, such interventions should have essentially no toxicity or side effects. In practice, the throughput of drug testing (currently conducted in animals) is one of the major limitations for identifying interventions to promote healthy aging. Hence, a challenge is to identify candidate drugs able to induce rejuvenation and/or healthy aging, with minimal side effects in a high throughput fashion. Here we propose to take advantage of a novel high content screening approach based on imaging of epigenetic landscape in single cells. To meet the challenge, we propose to take advantage of a novel technique we have developed that is rooted in the analysis of epigenome topography at the single cell level, automated microscopy, and machine learning. “Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes” (MIEL) captures patterns of nuclear staining of epigenetic marks (e.g. acetylated and methylated histones) and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. Pertinent to this application, we have tested whether MIEL approach is suitable for building a phenotypic cell-based assay for inducers of longevity at the cellular level. Our preliminary results validated MIEL assay for a high content screening application to identify novel candidate pro-longevity compounds. In sum, we have developed and validated a high content cell-based screening assay capable of identifying pro-longevity/healthy aging compounds based on their effect on epigenetic signature. Our specific Aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1. Screen for novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation. Specific Aim 2. Validation of novel inducers of cellular rejuvenation.

"AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution Abstract. Whole-organ 3D immunohistochemistry is revolutionizing the field of neuroscience, enabling unprecedented insight into the distribution of neural cells and neurological markers throughout the brain in health and disease. LifeCanvas Technologies is at the forefront of the new field of spatial proteomics, providing a complete workflow for whole-organ preservation, tissue clearing, immunohistochemical labeling, and imaging. Nevertheless, an ongoing challenge for such studies is the need to rapidly, reproducibly and rigorously quantify terabyte-sized datasets from whole-organ imaging efforts. While progress has been made in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enable detection of cellular and sub-cellular markers in neural tissue, one-size-fits-all algorithms are inadequate for analyzing complex, information-rich brain datasets due to varying biomolecular expression patterns (e.g. nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane-bound) and region-specific heterogeneities in cell density and neural cell types. However, AI-driven algorithms targeting a subset of labeling patterns can be effective provided the availability of adequate training data. LifeCanvas Technologies LCT is optimally positioned to develop highly accurate algorithms serving a wide range of detection tasks through its access to high volumes of whole-organ image data containing a variety of label expression patterns via its Contract Research Organization and user base. LCT proposes to develop a data analysis program, SmartAnalytics, which will embed a suite of AI algorithms within a user-friendly software package to identify labeled cell locations and characterize morphological features across the whole brain at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. Specifically, LCT will use intact, 3D immunolabeled mouse brains to design AI algorithms to detect labeled cells imaged at cellular resolution and generate further algorithms for the segmentation of labeled features imaged at sub-micron resolution. Data from LCT’s Contract Research Organization and academic collaborations will be continually fed back to improve and expand the library of detection algorithms available within SmartAnalytics, and these developments will drive further customer adoption and enhancement of future versions of the software. SmartAnalytics will guide users through model application, quality-control testing, and the generation of output products such as figures and summary statistics. In summary, SmartAnalytics will be an evolving and user- friendly workflow execution program that enables neuroscientists to take full advantage of their 3D image data, driving new discoveries in brain function, development and disease. Narrative. The ability to readily and accurately quantify proteomic expression patterns that define neural cell- type specific distributions and morphologies across intact brains will enable unprecedented and unbiased insights into studies of brain function. LifeCanvas Technologies’ state-of-the-art tissue processing pipeline provides uniform clearing, labeling, and imaging of whole brains at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. By developing Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect labeled cells and determine morphologies and by packaging these algorithms in a user-friendly software ‘SmartAnalytics’, LifeCanvas will enable neuroscientists to quantify image data and derive critical results towards a more complete understanding of brain function in development, health and disease.",AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution,10139966,R43MH125512,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Density', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organ Preservation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Research Contracts', 'Resolution', 'Rosaniline Dyes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'neuronal cell body', 'new technology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software development', 'statistics', 'submicron', 'terabyte', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"LIFECANVAS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,226754
"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs.

"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete. The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress. We propose to develop a lab-on-a-chip platform technology, Multifunctional Exosome Sorter (MFES), that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers integrating; (i) a vessel-on-a-chip module, (ii) a high-yield exosome size-based isolation module, (iii) a magnetic bead-based surface biomarker sorting chamber, and (iv) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology, where such a technological innovation will uniquely enable to study the biology of exosome subsets associated with flow dynamics in PAH.",A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH.,10158068,R21HL156761,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Culture Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vision', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hemodynamics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic beads', 'monolayer', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shear stress', 'stressor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236363
"Systems biology of quiescence entry Abstract This proposal aims to provide crucial training for the candidate’s long-term career plan to study how cellular quiescence is established through decision-making processes. The decision to undergo quiescence in response to stress or developmental signals is a fundamental and understudied property of living systems. Failure to maintain quiescence can lead to cell proliferation disorders in humans, such as fibrosis or cancer. Quiescence entry is triggered when multiple nutrient- and stress-sensing signaling pathways arrest the cell cycle machinery. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate stress response pathways with the cell cycle during quiescence remain largely unclear. This is, in part, due to the difficulties to simultaneously quantify multiple stress pathways at the single cell level in vivo. To solve this limitation, the candidate will use a microfluidics- fluorescent imaging system that tracks up to six different pathways simultaneously during the transition from proliferation into quiescence. Using this approach, the coordination between stress responses and the cell cycle machinery can be quantified with unprecedented temporal resolution in the model organism S. cerevisiae. A computational platform based on machine learning and time series analysis will be used to process the large imaging data derived from tracking six biomarkers simultaneously in single cells. An initial version of this framework found that during the onset of quiescence the nuclear levels of the conserved DNA-replication kinase Cdc7 are dynamically regulated. This approach also identified that the nuclear levels of the stress-activated transcriptional repressor Xbp1 define how the cell cycle is stopped during quiescence entry. Combining this computational approach with biochemical techniques will determine the molecular mechanisms for the establishment of cellular quiescence by modulation of stress responses and the cell cycle machinery. The candidate is to acquire crucial training in computational biology during the K99 phase of this proposal to complement his previous training in biochemistry, cell biology and yeast genetics. The candidate will be mentored by a leader in computational biology Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, whose lab develops advanced machine learning and time series analysis to study cellular signal transduction. This proposal harnesses the commitment of an entire bioinformatics core facility and the training environment of a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique computational and imaging framework, combined with biochemical approaches for the study of quiescence, will support the candidate’s transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of biomedically relevant principles of quiescence and cell cycle regulation. Narrative The precise integration of stress signals during the establishment of cellular quiescence is crucial to prevent cell proliferation disorders, such as fibrosis and cancer. However, it is unclear how stress responses are integrated during quiescence, in part, because of a lack of methods for simultaneously quantifying multiple stress pathways in single cells. To solve this problem, the proposed work will combine machine learning approaches with six color fluorescent microscopy to reveal the mechanisms by which stress responses coordinate quiescence.",Systems biology of quiescence entry,10115766,K99GM135487,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Carbon', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Core Facility', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In complete remission', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Meiosis', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nitrogen', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Nutrient Depletion', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Stress', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcription Repressor', 'Work', 'XBP1 gene', 'anaphase-promoting complex', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'cellular imaging', 'computational platform', 'computer framework', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gene repression', 'genetic approach', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'prevent', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'yeast genetics']",NIGMS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,95866
