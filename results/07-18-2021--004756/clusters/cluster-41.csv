"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care and enhancement of clinical outcomes.",Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma,9760521,F30CA239407,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Glioblastoma', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Radiogenomics', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Woman', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'career', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'mutational status', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'standard of care', 'temozolomide', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F30,2019,44949,0.1261937020984376
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This proposed research is to develop and disseminate a novel advanced machine learning-based imaging informatics system to better quantify Ki67 images for effective and efficient single-stage Ki67 LI assessment for GI and pancreatic NETs.",Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,9722699,R21CA237493,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Siblings', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gastrointestinal', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-task learning', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2019,169106,0.10387704683029658
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,9781262,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2019,584330,0.08057520184920727
"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9771401,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian learning', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'feature detection', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'learning algorithm', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'real-time images', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2019,194940,0.06408644365296713
"Quantitative Image Modeling for Brain Tumor Analysis and Tracking Project Summary Differentiation of tumor recurrence from radiation-induced necrosis (RN) is a critical step in the follow-up management of patients treated with stereotactic radiosurgery for brain tumor. A non-invasive method that is robust in discriminating RN from recurrent tumor using non-invasive method such as MRI is of a significant value for patients and physicians. The hypothesis of this proposed project is that advanced Machine-learning (ML) and image analysis of different MRI imaging information may hold potential for accurately detecting the difference between RN and recurrence of brain tumor is a substantial challenge in the daily practice in Neuro-Oncology. Furthermore, there is a need to study feasibility of translating our ongoing works in brain tumor volume quantitation into potential imaging device. Consequently, this Administrative Supplement propose the following Specific Aims for this study: Aim 1: To develop novel methods to discriminate RN from tumor recurrence in MRI. Aim 2: To develop and prepare a fast track SBIR proposal (Phase I and II combined) to be submitted soon after this Administrative Supplemental funding expires. If successful, robust discrimination of radiation-induced RN and tumor recurrence will make our current brain tumor and abnormal tissue volume segmentation methods and tools more robust and ready for use in the radiology and oncology practices. Furthermore, the planned SBIR project funding will lead the way to fully explore the possibility of launching a commercial software technology for brain tumor volume quantitation imaging device development. Project Narrative For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment.

"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9707393,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,313021,0.04222925028583594
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery. This project aims to develop a novel tool based on stimulated Raman microscopy to image fresh brain tissue in a label-free manner, providing comparable histological information to conventional H&E staining, to guide brain tumor resection in real time in the operating room.",Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery,9724467,R00EB020749,"['Agar', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atypia', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Biophysics', 'Bone marrow biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Density', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chromatin Structure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collagen', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Frequencies', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Skill', 'Linear Algebra', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitotic', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin Sheath', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical Injuries', 'Surgical Oncology', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Step', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'chemical bond', 'chemical group', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'commercialization', 'computer science', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'frontier', 'gray matter', 'human disease', 'image guided', 'image guided therapy', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'meningioma', 'microscopic imaging', 'mouse model', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'peer', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard care', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration', 'white matter']",NIBIB,"STATE UNIVERSITY OF NY,BINGHAMTON",R00,2019,243484,0.06834475271788804
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9638528,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.027690985025944213
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9743107,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,605394,0.12995696787434421
"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9766266,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infiltration', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'checkpoint receptors', 'chemoradiation', 'combinatorial', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inter-institutional', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic performance', 'public health relevance', 'receptor expression', 'recruit', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2019,161997,0.011138191872822062
"Radiogenomics framework for non-invasive personalized medicine Project summary Radiogenomics, is a burgeoning area of research that aims to link medical imaging with multi-omics molecular profiles of the same patients. Radiogenoimcs has shown its potential through its ability to predict clinical outcomes e.g. prognosis, and through predicting actionable molecular properties of tumors, e.g. the activity of EGFR, a major drug target in many cancers. The typical imaging genomics workflow consists of the following steps: (1) Identify the tumor through segmentation. This is often also defined as identifying Regions Of Interests or ROIs through a manual process with a radiologist or using computer vision algorithms. (2) Feature extraction, often also known as radiomics, whereby 100s of features are identified that capture the shape, the texture and the intensity distributions of lesions in 2D or 3D. (3) Supervised machine learning to predict clinical outcomes such as prognosis, overall survival or response to treatment, or predicting molecular profiles such as gene expression patterns or metagenes, or individual molecular properties such as the mutation status of a gene (e.g. EGFR). This workflow has been demonstrated in several cancers including lung cancer, brain tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer etc. Current radiogenomics applications are limited to study associations between imaging and molecular data, and predicting long term outcomes. However, no actionable information is gained from radiogenomics maps. In this renewal, we propose to develop a radiogenomics framework to support treatment response, treatment allocation and treatment monitoring: (1) we will develop informatics algorithms that integrate radiogenomic data for treatment response, (2) algorithms that allow combining radiogenomic data during treatment follow-up, and (3) algorithms that use the radiogenomic map to suggest novel drugs and predict drug target activities. Combining these complementary data sources in a radiogenomics framework for data fusion can have profound contributions toward predicting treatment outcomes by uncovering unknown synergies and relationships. More specifically, developing computational models integrating quantitative image features and molecular data to develop radiogenomics signatures, holds the potential to translate in benefit to tumor patients by investigating biomarkers that accurately predict therapy response of tumors. Readily, because medical imaging is part of the routine diagnostic work-up of cancer patients and molecular data of human tumors is increasingly being used in clinical workflows, therefore if reliable radiogenomic signatures can be found reflecting treatment response, translation to the clinical applications is feasible. Narrative We proposed a radiogenomics framework for treatment allocation, treatment follow-up and treatment monitoring to provide precision medicine for cancer patients. We will develop informatics methods integrating clinical, molecular and imaging data for therapeutic purposes. We will focus on the development of radiogenomic signatures that are predictive of treatment response, actionable and suggest the use of novel drugs.",Radiogenomics framework for non-invasive personalized medicine,10005534,R56EB020527,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Eye', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Radiogenomics', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer site', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'follow-up', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human data', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'mutational status', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive signature', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2019,444001,0.034647776872538755
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9788340,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2019,228089,0.09728611002807461
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9763504,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2019,368332,0.048698148728547296
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration.

The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9624746,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,295727,0.01787207642927943
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC. Project Narrative Tumor imaging quantification is indispensable for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is often the modality used because of its relatively low cost and wide availability.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs.

"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities.

"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9647173,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2019,192240,0.05517712922158505
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9743114,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2019,134632,0.06395446322638801
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9747360,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531751,0.06858651673719135
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field. PROJECT NARRATIVE Meningiomas are the most common type of intracranial tumor and are best treated by total resection when possible. The mechanical properties of these tumors are important factors in surgical difficulty, where soft, non- adherent tumors are more easily removed that firm or adherent tumors. This project will use Magnetic Resonance Elastography and related Slip Interface Imaging to directly measure these properties, providing new clinically-important information to neurosurgeons and patients.",Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas,9755633,R01EB027064,"['Acoustic Neuroma', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Arachnoid mater', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Neoplasms', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pituitary Gland Adenoma', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skull Base Neoplasms', 'Surgeon', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'mechanical properties', 'meningioma', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neurosurgery', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357750,0.0812837953420098
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9621372,K00CA212457,"['Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2019,83070,0.013111175555964487
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9703925,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2019,431871,-0.030958298373840353
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9980576,R01CA226527,"['Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,524967,0.05620193743984146
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9765042,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,530736,0.08082187872207144
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9759874,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2019,399937,0.038229605876083136
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance.

"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes.

"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,496626,0.028796323485876362
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently emerged as an exciting new treatment modality resulting in complete tumor regression in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% of HNSCC patients show any long-term survival benefit. This proposal seeks to significantly improve our understanding of HNSCC cancer immunology by identifying/characterizing the immune cell populations associated with durable antitumor immune responses following ICI therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving ICI efficacy in HNSCC patients.",Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer,9871980,K23DE029239,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antitumor Response', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytometry', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Head and neck structure', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'International', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Mus', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Immunity', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'checkpoint therapy', 'computer program', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymph nodes', 'maxillofacial', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'open label', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,184680,0.07846059211450251
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9743093,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'droplet sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunotherapy trials', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2019,2296097,0.017866551242626733
"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,9826761,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2019,378519,0.07623649212740481
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9724401,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585112,-0.01167147212808323
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9743120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2019,692707,0.05945875618500328
"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9827695,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,392987,0.03924800378279503
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome.

"Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer Project Summary Radiation therapy (RT) has a proven record of efficacy in treating many forms of pediatric brain tumors. However, it is associated with long-term side effects due to damage to healthy tissue. This is especially important in the developing brain, where long-term deficits can be seen in the areas of intelligence, attention, memory and psychomotor processing. To mediate these deficits, there has been a push away from whole brain irradiation to more targeted treatment by using dose painting intensity modulated radiation therapy (DP-IMRT). However, in order to use these techniques, more information about how dosing to organs-at-risk (OARs) affects outcomes, including volumetric changes in the brain. Voxel Healthcare LLC (formerly Advanced Medical Systems LLC) is the developer of ClickBrain – an automatic pediatric MR brain segmentation tool that uses cloud-based deep learning (Google TensorFlow) technology for radiology clinical decision support. In Aim 1a, we extend ClickBrain to ClickBrain RT – a system that will combine ClickBrain's pre-treatment brain structure segmentation outputs with radiation planning CTs and MRs to calculate dosing to OARs. ClickBrain RT will also segment longitudinal MRIs (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years) to track outcomes via volumetric changes. We will use OAR dosing, demographics, tumor type and grade, chemotherapy information, OAR and tumor volumetric measurements to predict tumor and OAR volumetric outcomes. We will adapt our existing version of a multi-time point machine learning technique to do this prediction task. In Aim 1b, a user interface for this cloud computing-based proof-of-concept system will be built to allow the RT planner to import patient information and see changes in predicted longitudinal post-RT OAR and tumor volumes, based on adjusting OAR dosages for a particular patient. Our initial validation (Aim 2) will focus on an existing database of 51 germ cell tumor patients acquired as part of standard of care and previous studies at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Germ cell tumors have relative uniform size and location and provide an ideal dataset to validate our proof-of-concept system. Our long-term goal for ClickBrain RT is to train the machine learning algorithm to provide optimized recommended OAR dosage ranges based on patient history and tumor information. Our software will allow radiation oncologists to optimize treatment and vastly improve long-term quality of life in pediatric brain tumor survivors. Narrative Mitigating radiation toxicity due to radiation therapy for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors is important to avoid long-term developmental side effects. Our ClickBrain RT software will use cloud computing-based deep learning technologies to automatically delineate key structures in the brain and to train a machine learning algorithm to predict volumetric changes due to treatment-related radiation dosing to these key structures. This will enable physicians to better avoid unnecessary radiation doses that may cause long-term deficits in children with brain tumors.",Machine learning-based radiation toxicity mitigation in pediatric brain cancer,9623177,R43CA233346,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Childhood Malignant Brain Tumor', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cochlea', 'Computer software', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Germ cell tumor', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Lobe', 'Location', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microtomy', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation Toxicity', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiologic Technology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Site', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Volume', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'dosage', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'negative affect', 'oncology', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"VOXEL HEALTHCARE, LLC",R43,2018,224726,0.019058972779802452
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9444495,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2018,49524,0.027690985025944213
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY  Knowledge from the recent clinical trials suggests that over 80% of head and neck cancer (HNC) are hypo-immunogenic cold tumors and non-responsive to immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) blockade. With the emerging combinatorial strategies for cold cancer, precise identification of this group of tumors is essential for the selection of optimal treatment protocols. However, there is no consistent algorithm available to assess the global immune profile of HNC. Most of the current immunoscore methods are based on immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a limited panel of biomarkers, which prevents a precise annotation of the landscape of tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). The IHC method is technically sensitive, and may present inter-institutional and inter-pathologists variations. Moreover, the current immunoscore only emphasizes on a few T-cell subsets, and does not integrate cancer genomic features that modulate tumor response to immune killing. In fact, strong evidence suggests that the type I interferon (IFN-I) pathway plays a fundamental role in HNC response to effector immune cells. Thus, leveraging global TIL profiles and cancer genomic features offers an unprecedented opportunity to classify HNC based on its immunogenicity. The current robust methods for cellular deconvolution are sensitive to outliers, which are frequently observed in the whole tumor RNA-Seq datasets. Our recent studies show that a novel machine learning tool Fast And Robust DEconcolution of Expression Profiles (FARDEEP), which adaptively detects and removes outliers, exhibits superior accuracy in immune cell deconvolution. In precise alignment with the FOA, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that a compound immunoscore integrating FARDEEP-assisted TIL deconvolution and cancer genomics can effectively identify cold HNC. To achieve this goal, our two immediate next steps are: **(1) We will develop a robust model-free approach to identify TIL-driving oncogenic pathways; **(2) We will construct a compound immunoscore integrating cancer genomic features and TIL profiles to identify cold HNC. These studies will develop a novel “statistical methodology appropriate for analyzing genome-wide data” and provide “statistical analysis of existing genome-wide data” for an NIDCR priority disease. This project will refine a robust and novel immune-cell deconvolution machine learning tool and characterize central oncogenic pathways that shift the TIL landscape. The new immunogenomics algorithms will streamline the immunoscoring method to effectively stratify HNC and contribute to the precision selection of combinatorial treatments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE  The immune microenvironment holds strong potential to complement the current head and neck cancer (HNC) staging system for more effective patient stratification. But the current immunoscores, which depict the infiltration of some subsets of T cells, are limited by the number of evaluated immune-cell subsets and exclusion of biomarkers for cancer sensitivity to immune killing. In this project, we will refine our unique robust methods to integrate global tumor-infiltrating immune cells with cancer genomics, constructing a compound immunoscore for the precise identification of hypo-immunogenic HNC.",Development of a Prognostic Compound Immunoscore for Head and Neck Cancer,9598702,R03DE027399,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Exclusion', 'Exhibits', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Group Identifications', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunogenomics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infiltration', 'Institution', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte Subset', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Role', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'checkpoint receptors', 'chemoradiation', 'combinatorial', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'immune checkpoint', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'inter-institutional', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic performance', 'public health relevance', 'receptor expression', 'recruit', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R03,2018,176339,0.011138191872822062
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9433637,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2018,73814,0.013111175555964487
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides2. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens5-7, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients.

"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9646469,K08CA234458,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'actionable mutation', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K08,2018,68267,0.09728611002807461
"QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING MRI images have been used for a wide variety of medical applications for a long time because they are safe and highly sensitive at detecting of tissue abnormalities that indicate cancer. MRI is generated by measuring the response of tissue components to a magnetic field. Also, based on the published statistics, brain tumor is one of the most common causes of death and early detection and monitoring is crucial for treatment. Literature and market review suggests that although extensive research exists on brain tumor detection using MRI images, MRI–based systems designed for brain tumor detection that have ultimate clinical value and use are lacking. Accordingly, we propose a new software technology that effectively detect, segment, classify and monitor brain tumor in MRI images. There have been extensive efforts on brain tumor detection in MR images because early detection has been always crucial for success of treatment. For ongoing work in our parent RO1 grant we are developing new machine learning and image analysis methods that for automatic detection and segmentation of brain tumor in MRI images, which is expected to help patients to have a much better chance of successful treatment. If successful, the proposed software technology in this project may potentially be the first that may be commercialized for brain tumor segmentation and classification on MRI images.",QUANTITATIVE IMAGE MODELING FOR BRAIN TUMOR ANALYSIS AND TRACKING,9706156,R01EB020683,"['Brain Neoplasms', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Detection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'magnetic field', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'statistics', 'success']",NIBIB,OLD DOMINION UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,46500,0.06189638304636394
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors Abstract Solid tumors are comprise the large majority of cancers (>90%). Standard of diagnosis and care often involved serial MR imaging for monitoring tumor response. It is not well understood how heterogeneity at the cellular and molecular levels affects the macroscopic imaging characteristics of these tumors. The long-term goal of this project is to provide computation tools for understanding the histopathologic variation of solid tumors and aid the development of image guided therapies for individualizing solid tumor treatment. The overall objective is to combine radiographic imaging with histopathological samples (i.e., radio-pathomics) to create and validate predictive tools for accurately defining tumor margins and spatial molecular profiles. Our central hypothesis is that microscopic cytological features and spatially dependent molecular profiles are reliably detectable and quantifiable with macroscopic MR imaging and that they can contribute towards the development of adaptive radiation therapy (ART). Two specific aims will objectively test this hypothesis by first determining which microscopic tissue features contribute to distinct measurements with MR imaging, and second, determining the development of fast and accurate computational tools for using MR image guided radiation therapy in clinical settings. Project Narrative The proposal aims to advance our current understanding of the association of malignant solid tumors at the cellular level. We plan to develop fast computational tools for real time image guided radiation, personalized to individual variations in cancer patients. Overall, this will help improve cancer diagnosis and treatment by better differentiation between healthy and aggressive cancer tissue, and by improved precision for targeted therapy.",Bayesian learning algorithms for identifying and classifying heterogeneity of cell types in variety of solid tumors,9603869,R21CA231892,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Microscopic', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radio', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image guided therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'individual variation', 'individualized medicine', 'member', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel architecture', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive tools', 'recruit', 'resilience', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2018,167475,0.06408644365296713
"Colorectal Cancer Molecular Subtype Assay Development and Validation ABSTRACT Stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) demonstrates substantial variability in tumor biology and clinical outcomes and there is a need to understand prognosis for patients in order to gauge risk benefit for chemotherapy and intensity of chemotherapy administration. These features are not well recapitulated by the current biomarkers in use in the clinic, majority of them are DNA based mutation assays. RNA expression patterns have been described by various investigators and may more fully recapitulate tumor biology. The clinical utility of these findings have been limited by the apparent conflicting subgrouping efforts and lack of a validated gene expression signature as a clinical grade assay applicable on formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue. In our international collaboration with several academic leaders who have previously published in this field, we have identified a robust consensus subgroup classification based on clustering approaches independent of clinical outcomes. Remarkably, this classification system, termed consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), identified 4 subgroups that provide novel insights into the classification of CRC. One subgroup with mesenchymal, TGF-β, and angiogenic features (CMS4) is associated with a hazard ratio for death of 2.26 (95% CI of 1.41 to 3.61, P=.001), significantly higher than other subgroups, in a multivariate model inclusive of current clinical and pathologic risk factors and genetic signature (Oncotype Dx). We hypothesize that a gene expression signature classifier can be developed and validated for determining the CMS in FFPE tissues, and that this classifier can be implemented to improve prognostication of stage III CRC by classifying them in CMS 4 vs. other subtypes. We have developed a support-vector-machine classifier with very high accuracy for classification based on an Affymetrix array from fresh frozen specimens. We have demonstrated good classification accuracy (>90%) using customized Nanostring codesets on FFPE tumor samples of 85 patients with stage III CRC. We have also demonstrated good technical reproducibility in six of those 85 samples. In this application, we will transfer the assay using the Nanostring Codeset to fresh frozen (FF) and FFPE using a set of paired samples, while maintaining classifier performance. We will then pursue technical and analytic validation of the assay, including precision in repeatability, reproducibility between sample types, inter- lab reproducibility, and impact of RNA quality/quantity. In the UH3 portion of the grant, we will clinically validate the prognostic utility of the gene expression signature assay in single-institution cohort, and then in a completed prospective study of FOLFOX chemotherapy (NRG/NSABPC-08), in a CLIA certified laboratory. Additional data will be used in predicting response to various standard of care therapeutics, which represents a series of future potential applications of the assay. By utilizing an assay developed to classify CRC by its tumor biology, we anticipate development of an enduring tool that will be of greater use than traditional fit-for-purpose tests.   NARRATIVE The molecular characteristics of colon cancer can be described by RNA-based expression, and a consensus classification method has been developed.

"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9503788,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population trends', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,528526,0.186168585789608
"RADIOMICS-BASED PROGNOSTIC MODEL OF CERVICAL CANCER HABITATS Abstract Despite significant advances in disease prevention and screening, locally-advanced cervical cancer (LACC) continues to be an important world-wide public health problem. Responses to currently available treatments are highly variable among patients with similar constellations of accepted prognostic features, implying that chemo-radio sensitivity, patterns of local tumor proliferation, and the propensity of metastatic spread are highly dependent on each patient's potentially unique cervix cancer habitat. Radiomic analysis of pre-, in-, and post- treatment medical images is an exciting new class of prognostic cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habit and has shown promise in more accurately separating favorable- from unfavorable- prognosis for patients for several tumor sites. No such radiomic-based prognostic model has been developed, for LACC that supports meaningful personalization of local and systemic treatment or biologically treatment adaptation based on response of radiomic biomarker profiles to the initial fractions of radiotherapy. To support future personalized chemo-radiation therapy, we propose to exploit a large, prospectively collected database of ~400 LACC patients consisting of archived PET, MRI, and CT images, standard biomarkers, and clinical outcomes to develop an innovative and accurate radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting LACC treatment outcomes. Previous efforts to utilize high-dimensional radiomic feature spaces to predict cancer treatment outcomes have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; radiomic feature redundancy, feature heterogeneity and uncertainty; unbalanced outcome class patient cohorts; and intrinsic differences in prognostic information content for features extracted from different modality images. We propose a principled and systematic strategy to address these challenges: a novel combination of belief function theory (BFT) and more standard machine learning techniques. To achieve these goals, we propose the following specific aims. Aim 1: Develop a novel radiomics-based prognostic model for predicting outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with definitive chemo-radiotherapy given longitudinal radiomic features from pre-, in-, and post treatment PET, CT, and MR images. Aim 2: Refine the developed prognostic model by use of the full 400 patient cases and systematically validate and test its performance. Aim 3: Investigate the potential clinical impact of the radiomic-based prognostic model and selected clinical applications. Clinical Impact and future plans: This project will result in a clinically useful family of models for predicting disease control outcomes from current LACC treatments. This clinical decision-making tool can be used to personalize initial treatment prescriptions as well as adaptive treatment prescription when combined with in-treatment radiomic biomarkers. We anticipate that many of the proposed methodological improvements investigated by this proposal will improve tumor response assessment in other disease sites.

"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9470702,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,321353,0.01787207642927943
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,0.08082187872207144
"MDCT Quantification of hepatic tumor viability for assessment of cancer therapy Project Summary / Abstract Tumor imaging quantification is critical for diagnosis, staging, and treatment evaluation, and multi-detector CT (MDCT) is the clinical imaging modality commonly used for patients diagnosed with hepatic malignancy because of its relatively low cost and wide availability. Conventional tumor quantification using either linear or volumetric measurement has demonstrated significant limitations in the evaluation of malignant liver tumors such as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) when being treated with targeted antiangiogenic therapies or locoregional therapies because changes in overall tumor size do not necessarily reflect tumor response to therapy. This leads to an unmet clinical demand to develop a functional tumor quantification biomarker for effective and accurate assessment of treatment response for liver cancer patients. The goal of this STTR project is to expand development of our functional tumor quantitative imaging biomarker (QIB), named hepatic tumor viability (HTV), for automated quantification of tumor viability of HCC using contrast-enhanced multi-phase hepatic MDCT images. The proposed HTV tool will be built upon existing technologies for quantitative imaging analysis of liver and liver tumors developed on the software platform “3DQI” in the 3D Imaging Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and will be evaluated using the MDCT datasets of 400 patients with advanced HCC treated with antiangiogenic therapies and trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center. The specific aims of this Phase II project are: (1) Development of HTV biomarker: We will continue to enhance the HTV biomarker developed in our Phase I project to improve the accuracy of HCC tumor segmentation using machine-learning classifiers, and to expand the four-phase MDCT imaging protocol developed in Phase I to include that of three-phase MDCT by omitting pre-contrast imaging for flexible adoption in clinical practice, (2) Evaluation of HTV biomarker: We will integrate the HTV biomarker into our 3DQI platform to conduct a clinical study to evaluate the accuracy and clinical performance of the proposed HTV biomarker in the assessment of treatment response by assessing 400 advanced HCC cases treated with antiangiogenic and TACE therapies collected at MGH Cancer Center, and (3) Preparation of FDA 510(k) clearance submission: We will establish the quality management system for 3DQI/Liver to meet FDA regulation, and prepare the required documentation for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. This aim is important for the long-term project goal of clinical translation of advanced QIBs developed on the 3DQI/Liver platform for tumor monitoring and response assessment of varied hepatic diseases on both CT and MR images. The successful development and validation of the proposed HTV biomarker will have a high clinical impact by providing a more effective and accurate tumor quantification tool compared to conventional size-based methods for reliable assessment of tumor progression and evaluation of treatment response for patients with HCC.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9564081,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2018,929069,0.10394027296524942
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9440279,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'experimental arm', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'secondary endpoint', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,449175,0.07364580779263592
"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,9582884,K99CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2018,134632,0.06395446322638801
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9525436,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'efficacy testing', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lead optimization', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'preclinical efficacy', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,541146,0.06858651673719135
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9523248,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,634276,0.12995696787434421
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9571234,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'predictive modeling', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2018,550445,0.038229605876083136
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,0.0225416485403329
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9605321,R37CA232209,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Premalignant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2018,445227,-0.030958298373840353
"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9577958,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Algorithms', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2018,737882,0.05945875618500328
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9536765,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'droplet sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunotherapy trials', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2018,2409446,0.017866551242626733
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9512832,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,608223,-0.01167147212808323
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,548074,0.030902358776019285
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits. However, it is often difficult to distinguish normal and cancerous tissue during surgery.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9410769,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2017,71064,0.013111175555964487
"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9353344,U24CA210990,"['Alpha Cell', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2017,452649,0.048698148728547296
"Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis Project Summary A wealth of data over the past few years, from our lab and others, has demonstrated that the mitochondrial morphology of tumor cells is distinct from normal cells. Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that genetic or pharmacological manipulation of the machinery that regulates mitochondrial morphology can impact a variety of tumorigenic processes. Indeed, in work performed for the parent grant of this proposal, we have shown that genetic inhibition of the mitochondrial fission GTPase Drp1 can block pancreatic tumor growth and increase survival in a genetically engineered mouse model. This work has led to the deeper question of how changes in mitochondrial shape, which ultimately result from a combination of both genetic and environmental influences, contribute to the physiological processes that drive tumor growth. This question has been difficult to ask using traditional genetic and pharmacological approaches due to the complexity of the signaling pathways that converge on the mitochondria and the inherent heterogeneity present within the tumor and its surrounding stroma. To that end, we have developed a new software package designed to catalogue the morphological features of mitochondria within cells in culture or in fixed tissue. By using this software to analyze the tumor cells developed in our mouse models of pancreatic cancer, we propose to determine the relationship between specific mitochondrial features and key physiological attributes of these tumors. To do this, we have developed a machine learning technique, validated against a panel of tumor derived pancreatic cell lines with genetically-induced mitochondrial heterogeneity, capable of identifying relationships between mitochondrial features, or combinations of mitochondrial features, and other attributes of those cells. This approach will allow us to leverage the wealth of phenotypic data we have collected from our tumors with the data we are now able to collect on the mitochondrial heterogeneity, either between or within those tumors, in order to identify the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in tumor growth, regardless of whether that heterogeneity arises from manipulation of the mitochondrial dynamics machinery or whether it arises from the myriad influences within the tumor environment. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical insights into the role that mitochondrial heterogeneity plays in pancreatic tumor growth and also pave the way for future analysis of mitochondrial heterogeneity in other tumor types. Project Narrative Our work exploring the role of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission in pancreatic tumor growth, using two relevant mouse models, has revealed that genetic inhibition of Drp1 can inhibit tumor growth and extend survival. In addition, these models provide a wealth of data to more deeply explore the relationship between mitochondrial heterogeneity and tumor physiology. We have developed robust computational methodology with which to explore this relationship. This exciting novel approach will provide critical insight into pancreatic tumorigenesis and potentially uncover novel therapeutic approaches.",Exploring the Role of Mitochondrial Fission in Pancreatic Tumorigenesis,9384887,R01CA200755,"['Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological Models', 'Catalogs', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Employee Strikes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Normal Cell', 'Oncogenic', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pancreatic cell line', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'pancreatic tumorigenesis', 'parent grant', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumorigenic', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,191853,0.1326100591411451
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9293390,R01NS042645,"['Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population trends', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,533501,0.186168585789608
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9312109,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2017,49044,0.027690985025944213
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,0.08082187872207144
"Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations Abstract With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data has moved to the forefront in the quest for individualized medicine. However, the lack of new computational tools to interpret and exploit the deluge of genomic data has severely hampered its clinical benefit. A further complication is that clinical genomic data is often obtained from tissues containing a mixture of different cell types. For example, tumor samples are a mixture of tumor subclones and normal cell lineages. As a platform for understanding this heterogeneity in tumor cell populations, our studies will focus on DNA methylation changes in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most prevalent, aggressive form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). DNA methylation is cell type- specific, likely contributes to the phenotypic variation in tumor subclones, and plays key roles in gene regulation and lymphoma pathogenesis. Defining the methylation and transcriptional profiles of tumor subclones is necessary to identify potential drug targets, predict disease progression, and identify overall prognosis. Further, current computational approaches to understand epigenetic heterogeneity are not well- suited for tumor analysis and do not link epigenetic changes to expression. Here, we propose to develop a new computational approach that uses genomic methylation data from bulk samples to define DNA methylation- and expression-based subclonal populations and relate these populations to disease progression. Our approach exploits the fact that methylation levels are an accurate measure of the underlying distribution of allelic methylation states in the tumor (e.g. 30% methylation means 30% of the alleles are methylated). Our approach takes genome-wide methylation data as input, and outputs the number of subpopulations, their respective proportions, and each underlying subpopulation’s DNA methylation profile. After deconvolution, we will extend our previous work showing that DNA methylation profiles are predictive of expression levels, and apply tools from machine learning to estimate the relative expression profiles in each subpopulation. This approach will allow us to take advantage of the vast amount of data currently being collected in large-scale sequencing projects and obtain genome-wide methylation information from cellular subpopulations even when surface markers cannot be used to physically separate the different subpopulations. Lastly, we will assess the clinical relevance of these approaches by using them to understand the molecular changes found in tumor subpopulations from samples of relapsed DLBCL. We envision these methods can be applied as investigative tools first, and later as cost-effective clinical tools, to analyze the epigenetic and transcriptomic heterogeneity in different tumor types and diseased tissues. Public Narrative Tumors, including B-cell lymphomas, are comprised of heterogeneous populations of cells. Decoding the regulatory circuitry in these sub-populations is critical to understanding tumor metastasis, therapy resistance and relapse. We propose to develop a new computational approach to use genome-wide measurements of DNA methylation in primary tumors to understand the regulatory landscape of these subpopulations. All software will be made publically available to broadly advance cancer-research nationwide. Results from this work will improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of B cell lymphoma development and relapse.",Deconvolution of Epigenomic Data to Characterize Cellular Subpopulations,9317775,R21LM012395,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'B-Cell Lymphomas', 'Biological', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complication', 'Computer software', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mixed Cellular Population', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Normal Cell', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Structure of germinal center of lymph node', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical sequencing', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'lymph nodes', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NLM,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,220064,0.03159398148549284
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,9389124,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injectable', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2017,716510,0.10394027296524942
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9264495,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,449175,0.07364580779263592
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9324902,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2017,248886,0.13106175916095006
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9333447,R01NS095411,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Initiators', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2017,544581,0.06858651673719135
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9314557,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,644766,0.12995696787434421
"Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Infiltration of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain make curative surgical resection of GBM impossible, and almost all will eventually recur. Thus, extraordinary significance is placed on radiation therapy (RT) strategies, which have been shown to be effective, but require strong imaging evidence to guide RT planning. Currently employed clinical imaging modalities include T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI, which only identifies leaky neovasculature associated with high grade tumor, and T2-weighted MRI, which is not specific for tumor infiltration. Through advances in neurosurgery, it is now possible to achieve complete or near-complete resection of the CE tumor component in many cases; thus, the region that is treated with the highest RT dose is limited to the empty resection cavity plus a small margin. Due to the generally larger size of the T2 area and unknown status of disease, it is treated to a lesser “microscopic disease” dose. Many times, however, this microscopic disease dose is inadequate to control the tumor. Spectroscopic MR imaging (sMRI) provides a highly sensitive and specific means of identifying these regions, although sMRI has not yet seen use in RT planning due to a lack of clinical decision support software for the analysis, display, and management of sMRI data. Three key hurdles to be overcome are: 1) lack of an automatic, fast and reliable method for spectral quality control; 2) the necessity of quantification of metabolite levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism; and 3) a clinician- friendly display of the sMRI spectra encoded as a high-resolution, continuous, 3D image set for direct registration and incorporation into the RT planning process. Currently, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and shepherding data between several tools, resulting in a complex workflow that takes hours and is impractical for routine use in a fast-paced clinical RT environment. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to radiation oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in RT planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning. Specifically, we will develop algorithmic filters for identifying (and eliminating) spectral artifacts, algorithms for personalized localization of tumor infiltration, and methods and interfaces for the volumetric display of sMRI data needed for RT planning and review. Success in the proposed work will produce an automated “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into routine clinical applications. This tool will also be highly valuable in the MRS-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative There is widespread agreement that MR spectroscopy can provide valuable information without the need for exogenous contrast agents, however the software tools needed to incorporate whole brain 3D spectroscopic MRI (sMRI) into clinical practice are lacking. We plan to develop a web-based sMRI clinical interface for the analysis, visualization and integration of sMRI data into patient management. This “scanner-to-clinician” platform is designed to provide quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis in order to integrate sMRI into the routine radiation therapy planning process. In addition, this user-friendly tool will be highly valuable in the sMRI-based diagnosis and evaluation of numerous other neuropathologies aside from cancer, including other primary (and metastatic) brain tumors, stroke, multiple sclerosis (and other demyelinating diseases), inborn errors of metabolism, and neurodegenerative diseases.",Development of automated web-based spectroscopic MRI clinical interface,9332618,R21NS100244,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'High-LET Radiation', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Surgically-Created Resection Cavity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Water', 'Work', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'expectation', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'neovasculature', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,233258,0.011010394880416156
"Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement Project Summary Combination therapy holds considerable promise for overcoming intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted therapies but will rely on our ability to precisely identify the best drug combination for particular tumors. While immense focus exists on using genomic information to direct therapeutic approach, many resistance mechanisms do not rely on genetic changes and, in fact, can arise from entirely tumor-extrinsic factors within the microenvironment. For example, though the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) AXL is widely implicated in resistance to targeted therapies such as those directed against EGFR, its regulation by phosphatidylserine, as opposed to mutation, amplification or autocrine ligand, make identifying the tumors that will respond to AXL- targeted therapy especially challenging.  We propose to study both downstream and receptor-proximal signaling during bypass resistance mediated by AXL, and then across a wider panel of RTKs. Integrating these measurements with quantitative modeling will identify the connectivity between receptors, interacting adapters, and downstream signaling events, thereby defining the essential set of signaling network changes required for tumor cell survival in response to targeted therapeutics. We will then apply this understanding by measuring RTK-adapter interaction using proximity ligation to predict the RTKs driving bypass resistance and test these predictions in a panel of patient-derived xenograft tumors.  This work will considerably improve our ability to identify effective drug combinations by (a) developing a mechanism-based assay for identifying which among many RTKs tumor cells are relying upon for survival, (b) improving our basic understanding of exactly how network-level bypass resistance arises due to activation of non-targeted RTKs both at the receptor-proximal and downstream signaling layer, and (c) expanding our understanding of the RTK AXL with links to resistance, tumor spread, and immune avoidance. Project Narrative The proposed research is of immediate relevance to the public health mission of the NIH as it will considerably improve our understanding of resistance to targeted lung cancer therapies, which currently greatly limits their efficacy. This will focus development of new targeted drugs to overcome resistance, and optimize the application of therapy combinations for individual patients.",Precision lung cancer therapy design through multiplexed adapter measurement,9388399,U01CA215709,"['Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Bypass', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complement Receptor', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Elements', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Immune', 'Ligands', 'Ligation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phosphatidylserines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RIPK1 gene', 'Receptor Activation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'autocrine', 'axl receptor tyrosine kinase', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'receptor', 'receptor expression', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2017,446226,0.038229605876083136
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,0.0225416485403329
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9338202,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Immunology Science', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2017,2187373,0.017866551242626733
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9315122,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Glioblastoma', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,119048,0.06883710302516634
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9305968,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,624988,-0.01167147212808323
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,0.030902358776019285
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy.

"Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors 4.4.7 Project Summary/Abstract  The central theme in this work is that critical spatial patterns exist in highly resistant cancer stroma and vascular density that inherently inhibit larger nanoparticle penetration into cancer, and that these phenotypes can be imaged in vivo. We will use in vivo diagnostic imaging, combined with ex vivo analysis to test this in pancreatic cancer, which has as well known drug penetration limitation. Specifically, we will quantify nanoparticle penetration in pancreas cancer, which has high stroma content and low vascular density. The analysis and prediction of efficacy will be quantitatively developed by methodological correlation of in-vivo and ex vivo images using Fourier spatial frequency analysis.  We will determine the characteristic spatial patterns of these tumor microstructures that present as barriers to nanoparticle transport, as assayed through in vivo/ex vivo studies. We have seen that these characteristic spectral features appear in high-field magnetic resonance imaging (HF-MRI) scans and micro-Computed Tomography (uCT) scans of tumors imaged within the ongoing nanoparticle project at DHMC. The scope of this project is to conduct a secondary analysis on the images that are being produced within these projects, with two specific aims. 1) We will directly correlate nanoparticle penetration and distribution to the Fourier spatial frequencies found in in vivo images by Fourier spatial frequency analysis in which we have demonstrated expertise. The in vivo images will be analyzed by correlating them with histological sections of nanoparticle distribution post-treatment. Tumors will be classified on two levels as either a high or low permeability to a specific nanoparticle formulation (to quantify the amount of agent delivered), and as having high or low isotropy (to quantify the dispersion of the agent). 2) We will then apply this characteristic morphology analysis to pre-treatment, pre-operative HF-MRI, uCT images, and analyze their value as a potential diagnostic classifier. We will use a Support Vector Machine Analysis to predict the permeability and isotropy of unknown tumors, and validate our results against experimental outcomes. An iterative strategy will optimize the predictive power of the method, and be used to distinguish between characteristic spectra that are good and bad classifiers.  The research will be produced using the unique software systems that we have designed during preliminary studies, and will be deployed on an analysis platform that can be integrated with the hospital- based DICOM and virtual pathology environment to allow clinical investigators to plan adjuvant therapies to promote nanoparticle efficacy. Several hundred high-quality scans are now available for analysis, which will be processed and reported on within the first year of funding. By year two, the established system is projected to be able to analyze images within a few minutes post-scan. These analysis methods will give us the key background needed to advance our fundamental understanding of nanoparticle in-vivo delivery, and test ways to interrupt transport barriers in interventional future work. 4.4.8 Project Narrative The PI will apply a novel image analysis method to identify spatial patterns in images taken from in vivo experiments that indicate the presence of physical barriers to nanoparticle and liposomal transport in solid cancer tumor. Successful completion of this proposal will result in methods to predict the permeability of tumors to nanoparticle and large-molecule adjuvant therapies during the planning stage.",Interpreting limits to nanoparticle delivery in high-stroma low-perfusion tumors,9172223,R03CA208510,"['Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Center', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Isotropy', 'Lead', 'Liposomes', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Nanotechnology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'density', 'design', 'fluid flow', 'histological image', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'oncology', 'prevent', 'research study', 'software systems', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R03,2016,81000,0.02405357868191492
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9229841,F99CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F99,2016,32196,0.013111175555964487
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9194067,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'genomic tools', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,562825,0.08082187872207144
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,9095431,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'molecular subtypes', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'radiosensitizing', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,538156,0.186168585789608
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9191930,F30CA206291,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'contrast enhanced', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'histological image', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2016,43576,0.027690985025944213
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival. Our tools will be shared as open-source software via NIH/NCI tool registries and open-challenge activities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Pattern analysis and machine learning methods are powerful knowledge discovery tools that can be very effective in identifying complex multi-parametric patterns from a diverse set of imaging and non-imaging biomarkers that can best predict treatment response and outcome. Our method will leverage the richness of available data to point to new imaging biomarkers that are better early predictors of response, enabling personalized treatment decisions for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.        ",Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response,9106459,R01CA197000,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Burden', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Image', 'In complete remission', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Property', 'Registries', 'Residual Cancers', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'computerized tools', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,498724,0.07364580779263592
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9144743,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Cell Migration', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'live cell microscopy', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2016,249000,0.13106175916095006
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9150339,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2016,547736,0.06858651673719135
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9186255,R01CA206180,"['Accounting', 'Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Partner in relationship', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'forest', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,669786,0.12995696787434421
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,0.0225416485403329
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

By interrogating multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples, it is the aim of this proposal to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.",Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance,9059044,U01CA168426,"['Acute T Cell Leukemia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heel', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Indoles', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Oncogenes', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA interference screen', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'document outlines', 'drug sensitivity', 'genetic profiling', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning strategy', 'malignant phenotype', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'novel', 'programs', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2016,1238106,0.07046581888749252
"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). The successful validation of msCHIP could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS,9037632,R21CA195152,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellularity', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Indiana', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease heterogeneity', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'histological image', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'indexing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,201504,0.018407999438923125
"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field.

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,9128413,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'informatics infrastructure', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,117968,0.06883710302516634
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9176586,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,699670,-0.01167147212808323
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,0.030902358776019285
"Stimulated Raman imaging for label-free histology to guide brain tumor surgery ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of brain tumor surgery is to maximize removal of tumor without causing permanent neurologic deficits. Studies have shown that outcomes for patients depend strongly on these two variables. However, this is difficult because tumor tissue is often indistinguishable from healthy tissue in the operating room. Preoperative and intraoperative MRI through neuronavigation can be used to guide brain tumor surgery, but it is not able to accurately delineate the tumor margin due to the brain deformation and brain shift during surgery. H&E staining as the current gold standard is often performed intraoperatively for preliminary diagnosis, but it is not used to guide extent of resection routinely due to the limitations including tissue artifacts, labor-intensiveness, and time delay. Fluorescence guided surgery is beginning to be used to guided brain tumor surgery, but is generally not useful for low grade gliomas, the tumors which pose the greatest challenge and opportunity to extend survival and improve quality of life. Stimulated Raman imaging (SRI) has been used for rapid label-free biomolecular mapping in live tissue. Recently we have developed a novel approach with SRI to image nucleic acids, together with protein and lipids. Visualization of nucleic acids allows definition of nuclear morphology and chromatin structures, thereby enabling pathologic evaluation of clinically relevant cellular morphology, providing almost equivalent information to H&E staining. The goal of this translational research is to establish the methodology and practice for label-free histopathology with SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, and eventually develop it into a clinical device for ambient SR imaging of fresh tissue in the operating room in real time If the aims are achieved, this project will greatly improve the current clinical practice of brain tumor surgery by providing real time tissue diagnosis for more precise control of the extent of resection and preservation of neurologic function. Furthermore, this approach may be of value for all oncologic surgeries and other clinical pathology such as fine needle biopsies and bone marrow biopsy. The candidate for this award Dr. Fake Lu is a postdoctoral research fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Lu has extensive experience and expertise in biophotonics and biomedical optics, specialized in system innovations of stimulated Raman microscopy and multiphoton microscopy for biomedical applications. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. BWH is also home to the National Center for Image Guided Therapy (P41) and the Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided operating suite (AMIGO) infrastructure which will greatly support to proposed research. Dr. Lu's long term research goal is to develop and apply advanced biophysical and optical technologies and devices to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases, such as cancers, for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of translational research. The immediate objectives for the five-year award period is to 1) establish and evaluate label-free histopathology SRI for brain tumor diagnosis, 2) to demonstrate ambient imaging of surgically removed fresh tissue for diagnosis of brain tumors for real time guidance of neurosurgical resection, 3) to develop a novel stimulated Raman microscopy to collect full spectral data in parallel for label-free histopathology, as well as lipid biomarker screening, 4) t develop a computer algorithm for SR image analysis to realize automatic brain tumor diagnosis, and 5) finally by integrating the instrument and software to build and demonstrate a prototype of a clinical device for guiding neurosurgical resection of brain tumors. This device could also be used for other oncologic surgeries and will have great potential for commercialization. To conduct the proposed research, in addition to further develop his current strengths in biophotonics, stimulated Raman microscopy, and nonlinear optical microscopy, Dr. Lu plans to receive more education and training to enrich and expand his knowledge and expertise in the following four areas: 1) to receive critical training in conducting translational research, 2) to enrich his knowledge and deepen his understanding in brain tumor biology and medicine, 3) to learn skills in developing computer algorithms for SR image analysis, and 4) to prepare for writing grant applications and seeking funding independently. Dr. Lu will participate in 12 formal courses selected from those offered by Harvard Catalyst and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH and Harvard University, seminar series on biomedical image analysis organized by MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He will also attend one or two annual conferences per year to present his work for peer discussion. A strong mentoring team was organized to provide solid support to the proposed research and Dr. Lu's career development, including Dr. Alexandra Golby in neurosurgery at BWH, Prof. X. Sunney Xie in coherent Raman microscopy at Harvard, Prof. Nathalie Agar in molecular cancer diagnosis at BWH, Prof. Polina Golland in computer-based image analysis at MIT, and Dr. Sandro Santagata in neuropathology at BWH. This career development award will provide Dr. Lu with the training and skills needed to transition into an independent investigator in translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Surgery is the standard treatment for brain tumors, and the goal of brain tumor surgery is to completely remove the tumor without causing neurologic deficits.

"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence. Therefore, it will pave the way for more refined and targeted treatments of peritumoral brain tissue, which is where most tumor recurrence occurs.",Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin,8915752,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Vascularization', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'brain tissue', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'radiosensitizing', 'social', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trend', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2015,541169,0.186168585789608
"Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Candidate: Majoring as analytical chemist during the time in Belgrade, Serbia, Dr. Gligorijevic has become an expert in optics and live cell microscopy over the course of her graduate training at Georgetown University and developed several novel microscopy-based technologies. During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments. During the mentored phase of the Award, Dr. Gligorijevic will incorporate the relevant principles of advanced statistics and mathematical modeling of dynamical systems into her background of tumor biology and microscopy. She will take coursework offered at Einstein and meet regularly with her sponsor and co-sponsor. This training will make it possible to build a laboratory which investigates mechanisms of metastasis using the integrative, systems microscopy approach and utilizing information from molecular to population levels.  Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects. Consulting member of Advisory Committee, Dr. Robert Singer, is an expert in combining experimental and theoretical biology and a renowned mentor. The co-sponsor, Dr. Aviv Bergman, is the Founding Chair of Systems Department at Einstein and teaches coursework which will be a part of the career development. Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.",Systems Microscopy Analysis of Tumor Cell Motility in Microenvironment Context,9070066,R00CA172360,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemotactic Factors', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early treatment', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fibroblasts', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metalloproteases', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Publications', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Serbia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'career development', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'design', 'flexibility', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'interest', 'intravital imaging', 'macrophage', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'research study', 'statistics', 'time use', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R00,2015,249000,0.13106175916095006
"Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Genomic information can allow investigators to devise precision therapies that target molecular lesions specific to a patient's cancer. One of the molecular lesions present in many malignant tumors is loss of the NF1 tumor suppressor, which is a driver in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), one of the most frequently inherited genetic disorders. NF1 exhibits a broad clinical spectrum including benign nervous system tumors called neurofibromas, low-grade astrocytomas, pheochromocytoma, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Plexiform neurofibromas (PN) occur in deep nerves and can degenerate into malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), chemo- and radiation-resistant sarcomas with a dismal 20% five-year survival rate. In NF1 carriers, the lifetime risk is 30% for PN and 8-15% for MPNST. NF1 mutations are also found in sporadic tumors including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), melanoma, pheochromocytoma, ovarian, uterine, and lung cancers. Furthermore, in animal models and human tumor lines NF1 loss has been shown to drive GBM. A targeted molecular therapy designed to inhibit tumor-initiating and -promoting cells would substantially advance our ability to treat tumors that develop as a result of NF1 loss. Using complementary screening platforms, we identified small molecules that selectively killed or stopped the growth of cells carrying a mutation in NF1 as well as their molecular targets. In this application we focus on our top small molecule leads and the power of our model systems to test the hypothesis that aggressive neurological cancers that are known to be driven by NF1 loss and for which no cure exists, including PN, MPNST and GBM, will respond to molecules that we identified as synthetic lethal with NF1 loss. For this, we will determine pharmacokinetic properties of our top small molecule leads and, where needed, conduct structure-activity relationship studies to improve kinetics and/or reduce toxicity in order to test their efficacy in pre-clinical models of PN and GBM. We will leverage our model systems to define the mechanisms of action of our small molecule leads and add to our pipeline drugs in clinical trials that share the same targets. In addition to mutational inactivation, some GBM tumors exhibit down-regulation of the NF1 protein. Our lead compounds also stopped the growth of human GBM and neuroblastoma cells with low NF1 protein in vitro, supporting the broad application of the small molecule leads that we have identified. To capture tumors that have lost NF1 by any mechanism, we constructed an RNA-based classifier, which is capable of identifying downstream transcriptomic effects that indicate NF1 inactivation in GBM, using machine learning. We will apply the RNA-based classifier, along with targeted sequencing of NF1, to identify additional patient derived xenograft (PDX) GBM tumors that have an inactivating mutation of NF1 or molecular signatures of NF1 loss and test their response to our lead compounds in pre-clinical models. We expect that this work will provide new targets and therapeutic leads for aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The work described in this proposal aims to find the Achilles heel of aggressive neurological cancers driven by NF1 loss for which no cure exists. These cancers include neurofibromas, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, glioblastoma (GBM), and neuroblastomas, all with dismal 5-year survival rates. Our multidisciplinary approach to develop an innovative conduit for identifying new targets with potential to cure such malignancies addresses an unmet clinical need.            ",Targeting Tumors with NF1 Loss,9037783,R01NS095411,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Astrocytoma', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Dose', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Targeting', 'Embryo', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Inherited', 'Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Protein', 'Neurofibrosarcoma', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Plexiform Neurofibroma', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Property', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schwann Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'The Jackson Laboratory', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Uterine Cancer', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeast Model System', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cell growth', 'clinical efficacy', 'efficacy testing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'killings', 'lifetime risk', 'malignant neurologic neoplasms', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'neurofibroma', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'public health relevance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'success', 'targeted sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor']",NINDS,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2015,572285,0.06858651673719135
"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,0.0225416485403329
"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)- based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients (OSCC) are likely to have aggressive cancers and, perhaps even more importantly, for identifying which patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8923176,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'genetic approach', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,203048,0.08518807988888655
"Computerized morphologic-molecular predictor of progression in DCIS ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, nd treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing sub-visual attributes about tumors just from morphology. Some of these sub-visual features may encode for disease aggressiveness in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer. Additionally these sub-visual or ""histologic biomarkers"" can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and can be extracted via computerized image analysis. Recent analyses have shown that one of the major reasons for the ""over-diagnosis"" of breast cancer is the increased diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The current rate of DCIS diagnosis is 56 per 100,000 women (NEJM 2012). The standard of care for DCIS management is surgery followed by local radiation with the addition of endocrine therapy for lesions expressing estrogen receptor. This regimen brings the recurrence rates down from 25% (in untreated patients) to around 10%. Identification of which patients may benefit from treatment has been difficult because of the low incidence of adverse events necessitating long term followup. Molecular studies recently been performed by the Badve group (in collaboration with Genomic Health, Inc) on the E-5194 clinical trial, led to the development and commercialization of a molecular assay, the DCIS Score, which predicts the likelihood of development of ipsilateral DCIS and/or invasive cancer. However, the DCIS Score does not comprehensively account for disease heterogeneity since the assay was developed in a cohort considered low risk by clinicopathological characteristics; the performance of the assay in the ""real-world"" situation is not known. The focus of this project is t optimize and evaluate a multistain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which DCISs are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE). msCHIP employs digitized H&E and immunohistochemistry stained (Ki67, CD10 measuring cellular proliferation, vascularity) tissue sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei, and proliferative index will be extracted via advanced computer vision tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive DCISs will be identified. The successful validation of msCHIP on a large cohort of 300 cases could pave the way for rapid adoption of msCHIP as an oncological decision support tool, providing critical information for more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a multi-stain computerized histomorphometric and histochemical image-based predictor (msCHIP) to identify which ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS) are likely to be clinically aggressive and hence result in an ipsilateral breast event (IBE).

"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8887315,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'quantitative imaging', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,117968,0.06883710302516634
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,0.030902358776019285
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8620732,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2014,219825,0.11695372556810646
"Predicting brain tumor progression via multiparametric image analysis and modelin     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-grade brain gliomas, the most common of which is glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), have terrible prognosis and a median patient survival of about 12 months. Although combinations of surgical removal, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are used in the clinical practice, a  fundamental and persistent limitation in treating these aggressive tumors is that they tend to  infiltrate into normal tissue well beyond margins visible via imaging. Since assessing the spatial  extent of tumor infiltration is nearly impossible using current radiologic reading practices, clinical  treatment tends to be restricted to parts that are deemed to be clearly malignant, frequently only  the enhancing tumor. This failure to aggressively treat the infiltrating tumor accelerates tumor  recurrence, and eventually patient death. This proposal aims to develop computational modeling  and image analysis methods that will improve our ability to estimate GBM infiltration, as well as  to predict tissue that is likelyto present fastest tumor recurrence, thereby eventually opening the  way for more aggressive, yet targeted, treatment, such as targeted aggressive surgical removal  and/or radiosurgery. To achieve our goal, we will integrate information from several sources:  1)  advanced multi-parametric imaging, which captures many aspects of tumor anatomy and  physiology~ 2) computational modeling of tumor growth and infiltration~ 3) machine learning  methods which, after appropriate training, can learn subtle and potentially complex imaging  phenotypes of infiltrating tumors~ 4) statistical atlases, which capture population-based trends  that can offer additional insights into tumor growth, such as relationship of infiltration to  vasculature and to white matter fiber pathways~ 5) data from one of the largest patient  populations having advanced imaging, genotyping, follow-up till tumor recurrence, and  histological analysis.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advance computational imaging and informatics methods for analysis  of high-grade gliomas (brain tumors). It will compile a unique database of data from several  hundred patients and will construct predictive models of infiltrating malignant tumor and of later  recurrence.

During the postdoctoral period, Dr. Gligorijevic has focused on studying tumor cell intravasation in breast tumors, in living animals. To do so, she introduced several advancements into in vivo multiphoton microscopy. Dr. Gligorijevic is funded by DOD and Charles Revson Fellowship and has received several honors for her research. Her work to date resulted in one patent, ten peer-reviewed and ten other publications. Recent research has shown that different components of tumor microenvironment have an essential role in tumor progression. In order to decipher the network of interactions which shape the tumor environment and determine tumor cell behavior, it is ideal to apply systems biology approaches combined with in vivo microscopy, as cell cultures are limited in their complexity, mouse models are time-consuming and expensive and in silico models need optimization based on experiments.

Environment: Sponsor of the PI, Dr. John Condeelis is a Co-Chair of Anatomy Department and Biophotonic Center at Einstein. His lab and the Center create a multidisciplinary environment focused on answering mechanisms of human diseases, such as cancer, through use of microscopy. The Center is well known for its shared imaging resources and Innovation Laboratory where new microscopy systems are custom-built to accommodate specific needs of different projects.

Einstein is an institution which highly values collaboration and insists on career development of postdoctoral fellows, instructors and junior faculty.  Research: While most research of tumor microenvironments focuses on isolating and understanding single parameters, an integrative, systems-level network of interactions among relevant biological players is missing. In primary tumors, there are numerous biomechanical signals able to direct tumor cell movement towards and into the blood vessels. Growth factors, secreted by host macrophages, fibroblasts and endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment are the main chemoattractants but recent studies show that the extracellular matrix also plays an important role. In loose extracellular matrix, tumor cells can migrate by reorganizing their cytoskeleton, generating a protrusive force. In regions with stiff extracellular matrix, simple locomotion is not possible. Here, tumor cells become invasive and degrade extracellular matrix, mainly by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Tumor cell migration was well characterized in vivo, but the mechanism of the switch from locomotory to invasive state and assembly of invasive protrusions in vivo are unknown. To address the link between integrated microenvironment signaling and the tumor cell behavior, it is necessary to combine cell biology, advanced microscopy and systems biology. In preliminary experiments, tumor cells were recorded using time-resolved 3D multiphoton imaging in living mice and two different protrusion types were observed: a) locomotory protrusions which quickly lead to migration of the tumor cell and b) invasive protrusions, which are persistent and MMP-dependent. The goal of Aim 1 is to investigate the role of invasive protrusions in the tumor cell intravasation and metastasis. A combination of fluorescent reporters will be used for imaging of invasive protrusion assembly and investigation of consequent tumor cell fate. Aim 2 explores signals which drive tumor cells to form either locomotory or invasive protrusions or to switch between behaviors. In areas which contain either locomotory or invasive protrusions, tumor microenvironment parameters are recorded simultaneously (number of macrophages, collagen stiffness, blood vessel size etc.). Imaging analysis results in a data matrix, which is analyzed by a Support Vector Machine classification. Classification shows that tumor cells switch from locomotory to invasive states under very specific conditions. Proposed experiments test the hypothesis that tumor cell behavior can be changed by slightly modifying microenvironment parameters. Relevant microenvironment parameters are incorporated into an integrative mathematical model of the tumor cell switch from locomotory to invasive state, in Aim 3. Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation).

"Systems Biology of Tumor Progression and Drug Resistance     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of multidimensional datasets characterizing genetic, epigenetic, and functional properties of large normal and tumor-related samples is creating unique opportunities for the systems-level dissection of mechanisms associated with malignant phenotypes. Coupled with novel high-throughput technologies and computational methodologies for the dissection, interrogation, and perturbation of genome-wide regulatory pathways, this will lead to highly efficient approaches for the rapid identification and validation of therapeutic targets, their small molecule inhibitors, and associated biomarkers. Columbia University investigators have pioneered systems-biology-based approaches for the dissection of regulatory networks in human malignancies and for their interrogation, using computational, RNAi, and small-molecule approaches, to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this project is the use and build upon a successful pipeline between the investigators labs for the discovery and validation of master regulator modules that implement functional bottlenecks that integrate aberrant signals from multiple genetic and epigenetic alterations, and thus, constitute natural dependencies (i.e., Achille's heel) for the tumor subtype. These will be characterized in terms of their synergistic behavior, driver genetic alterations, and druggable modulators. This pipeline will allow processing of a novel tumor phenotype every 18 to 24 months, yielding validated individual and synergistic targets that constitute either oncogene or non-oncogene dependencies of the tumor or that increase sensitivity to existing FDA approved or late-stage development compounds. Relevance: The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research. The goal of this proposal is to leverage an integrative computational and experimental pipeline for the systematic identification of novel potential targets that may inspire future development of therapeutic applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of targets that abrogate tumorigenesis in the patient, are extensively biochemically characterized, chemically tractable, and highly penetrant constitutes one of the greatest challenges of cancer research.

"Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By 2020 the number of patients with p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is predicted to surpass that for cervical SCC. Epidemiologists have termed this a head and neck cancer ""epidemic."" At the same time, there is an emerging view that we may be ""over-treating"" patients with p16+ (HPV-related) OSCC because it is typically more biologically indolent, with tumors having less gross chromosomal abnormalities, ~1/2 the gene mutation rate, and favorable responses to treatment. For these reasons, many speculate that therapies could be ""de-escalated"" to maintain favorable patient survival while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. However, a significant minority of patients with p16+ OSCC have aggressive disease that will recur, predominantly in the form of distant metastasis, resulting in death. There are currently few clinical-and no molecular-markers to discriminate more from less aggressive p16+ OSCC.  The focus of this project is to optimize and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ OSCC are likely to be clinically aggressive and which OSCC patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. QuHbIC only requires digitized images of standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections, from which a series of features describing spatial distribution, morphology, texture and arrangement of tumor and stromal cell nuclei will be extracted via advanced computer vision and pattern recognition tools. Thus ""histologic biomarkers"" for more and less aggressive p16+ OSCC will be identified. Although molecular genetic approaches have become popular for tumor characterization, H&E morphology is still remarkably useful. In reality, tumor morphology reflects the sum of all molecular pathways in tumor cells, thereby providing incredible utility for predicting tumor biology, clinical behavior, and treatment response. While the visual reading of such slides by pathologists can predict behavior, sophisticated histomorphometric analysis with computer-aided quantitation has the potential to ""unlock"" more revealing information about tumors just from their morphology. The hypotheses underlying this project are that (a) markers for disease aggressiveness are encoded in visual attributes in histological (biopsy or resection) images of cancer, and some of these ""histologic biomarkers"" (e.g. nuclear anaplasia and/or multi-nucleation) can be correlated with disease recurrence independent of other clinical and pathologic features; and (b) these ""histologic biomarkers"" can be extracted via computerized image analysis.  QuHbIC will be trained and refined via a large cohort of digitized H&E slides with long term clinical follow up data from Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). Independent evaluation of the classifier will be performed on scanned H&E slides available from both Wash U and Johns Hopkins University. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for rapid integration of QuHbIC into the clinical workflow as a decision support tool, providing critical information to assist oncologists in making more informed treatment decisions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In this project we propose to develop and evaluate a quantitative histomorphometric (QH)- based image classifier (QuHbIC) to identify which p16+ (HPV-related) oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients (OSCC) are likely to have aggressive cancers and, perhaps even more importantly, for identifying which patients have cancers that are very unlikely to recur. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as a decision support tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be ""de-escalated"" or specifically targeted in order to maintain favorable survival rates while minimizing the substantial (and long term) treatment-related morbidity and expense from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy.            ",Histologic image-based aggressiveness prediction in p16+ oropharyngeal carcinoma,8756202,R21CA179327,"['Adoption', 'Anaplasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gene Mutation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear', 'Oncologist', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiosurgery', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Washington', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,185934,0.08518807988888655
"Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV) is the most common and highest-grade astrocytoma with uniformly dismal prognosis. In contrast to the lower grade gliomas (grades II and III), GBMs present radial growth rates almost 10 times as fast. Three pathophysiologic features, including necrosis, cellular pseudopalisades surrounding necrosis, and microvascular hyperplasia, are considered as hallmarks for GBM prognosis and are believed to be relevant to the drastically accelerated disease progression. Additionally, a population of Glioma Stem Cells (GCSs) has been found pertinent to the new neovascular formation, leading to GBM tumor outward growth. However, the definitive roles of these pathologic features and the associated signaling networks in GBM progression and their interactive mechanisms remain ill defined, because of limited capacity of biomarker observation and data analysis. The proposed project will create a new avenue for GBM research by leveraging computational power and machine intelligence for analyses of large-scale pathology images and spatially referenced, multiplexed biomarker data. A comprehensive system and analytical infrastructure will be developed to quantitatively investigate 1) spatial distributions f GBM invasion-related pathologic structures and GSCs, 2) functions of the in-situ signaling genes and regulatory networks responsible for GBM progression, and 3) the significance of morphologic, molecular, and signaling network variation across GBM microenvironments. A set of scalable image processing algorithms for analyses of spatial distributions and co-localizations of phenotypic features and biomarkers will be developed and applied to whole-slide pathology brightfield and quantum dot immunohistochemistry images of GBMs. Derived features and boundaries of phenotypic structures, and spatial distributions of biomarkers will be archived and integrated in a database for pathology and in-situ molecular imaging data where scientific queries can be invoked to support the analysis of GBM tumor progression mechanisms. In particular, multiplexed quantum dot immunohistochemistry (mQD-IHC), a new biomarker staining technique, will be leveraged to show the locations and expressions of multiple biomarkers of interest within the same tissue spatial reference. The combined expertise in large-scale pathology image process, high performance data computation, mQD-IHC staining technique for multiplexed biomarker investigation, and phenotype- genotype data integration supported by high-throughput data query power from customized database enables a unique research vehicle to investigate GBM tumor expansion mechanisms. Notably, the proposed research work can be generalized to catalyze other computational cancer research involving large-scale data and phenotype-genotype information integration. Therefore, it will present a broad impact on future translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Integrated analysis of spatial configurations of tissue pathologic features and underlying molecular biomarkers accounting for cancer progression is an important way to understand tumor expansion mechanisms. To advance in this research field, I propose to develop automated image analysis tools, database-based spatial integration methods, and mathematical models for tumor microenvironment representation to support quantitative investigations on Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor invasion mechanisms with definitive pathology imaging and multiplexed molecular biomarker data from whole-slide images of GBM specimens.            ",Quantitative Analysis of GBM Invasion Mechanisms with New Imaging Protocol,8618183,K25CA181503,"['Accounting', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytoma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human', 'Hyperplasia', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'Location', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Necrosis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quantum Dots', 'Radial', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Variant', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'molecular imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascular', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'relational database', 'spatial integration', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,116888,0.06883710302516634
"MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop an image-based diagnostic system for Glioblastoma (GBM) that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. This should facilitate the delivery of individualized care for patients with GBM. Current therapy selection is formulaic and uniform for all patients and does not account for broad genetic diversity that contributes to treatment resistance and dismal prognosis. Specifically, each patient's GBM is uniquely heterogeneous and comprised of multiple distinct subclonal populations with differing susceptibilities to therapy This diversity causes tumors to respond non-uniformly to targeted therapy and allows resistant clones to repopulate as recurrent disease. Additionally, conventional MRI routinely guides surgical resection of enhancing tumor core, but leaves behind tumor populations within adjacent non-enhancing parenchyma, or brain around tumor (BAT). The BAT represents the primary target of adjuvant therapy because it harbors the residual tumor populations that nearly universally recur. Curating the genomic diversity within BAT should inform treatment selection, but this region is almost never biopsied because it is poorly evaluated on conventional MRI. Currently, there is no systematic method that addresses intratumoral heterogeneity to characterize the regional genomic diversity within BAT. To address this critical need, this exploratory proposal will develop and test a novel mapping system that integrates multi-parametric MRI with image-guided tissue analysis and machine learning (ML) algorithms to delineate regional genomic variations in GBM. This system uses conventional MRI to identify major tumoral subcomponents: enhancing core, BAT, and central necrosis. Within these subcomponents, advanced MRI (perfusion, diffusion, texture) will further characterize regional tumor properties (i.e., angiogenesis, permeability, invasion, and proliferation) that represent phenotypic expression of underlying genomic status. These MRI traits will guide stereotactic biopsies from distinct tumoral subregions to generate matched pairs of MRI and genomic data. An ML algorithm will incorporate these data to estimate regional genomic diversity throughout each tumor, including BAT areas that have not been surgically sampled. We have unified a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from institutions that have substantial and long-standing collaborations. Our group offers expertise in multiple fields of study that are necessary to accomplish the research aims, including: 1) image processing and analytics; 2) image-guided stereotactic surgery and coregistration; 3) development of machine learning (ML) methodology; and 4) comprehensive genomic interrogation and cell biology of tumor within BAT. If successful, the work proposed here should significantly impact how GBM patients are diagnosed and treated. This potentially improves clinical outcomes by enabling a paradigm shift from ""one treatment fits all"" to a mutations-based approach that selects combinatorial therapies targeting individual tumor populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential genetic underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing an image-based mapping system that characterizes regionally diverse populations within individual tumors, the proposed exploratory work will facilitate the development of improved targeted combinatorial therapies as the basis for future work in an R01 application.             ",MRI-based mapping of regional genomic diversity in Glioblastoma,8490147,R21NS082609,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Necrosis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Biology', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'War', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'comparative genomic hybridization', 'field study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'killings', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,R21,2013,305251,0.11695372556810646

Using the predictive power of the model, experiments were designed to inhibit the invasive state and subsequent metastasis. Experimental outcomes will be used to optimize and complexify the model. Results of this study will lead to better understanding of the interplay among microenvironment components during tumor progression and the results will be used to improve diagnosis and treatment of early metastasis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project investigates the underlying mechanisms of tumor cell motility in the context of primary tumor microenvironment. Outcomes will reveal how host environment influences tumor cell entry into the blood vessels (intravasation). Findings will be applied towards new diagnostic and therapeutic markers for early metastasis in breast cancer.        The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8473174,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,421339,0.1078895281554834
"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.           The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells. The targeted detection of genomic lesions in a heterogeneous mix of mutated and wildtype cells, will find application as an early diagnostic for cancer. Thus, our computational methods will have an immediate and long term effect on human health.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8230636,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,337641,0.11467138353001702

"Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors  7. Project Summary/Abstract  Salivary gland tumors constitute 1-6% of head and neck tumors numbering 3600 new cases per year in the US. Though rare, there are 37 histopathological malignant subtypes and 13 benign subtypes of salivary gland tumors, making it one of the most challenging tumors to diagnose. While surgery is the main modality of treatment, advance unresectable primary, recurrent and metastatic tumors are generally fatal. The rarity of the tumors and multiple histopathological subtypes generated major clinical challenges for the early detection, diagnosis, therapeutic interventions and prognosis of patients with salivary gland tumors.  This application addresses the missing gaps in salivary gland tumor research by advancing the basic and translational sciences. Our approach is to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of salivary gland tumors using the most advanced omics technologies coupled with advanced data and bioinformatics analysis to develop tissue-based biomarkers for salivary gland malignancy detection as well as the potential use of salivary biomarkers to screen/risk assess symptomatic patients for salivary gland malignancies. In additional a systems network analysis approach (Weighted-Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, WGCNA) will be use to examine the derived omics databases to identify pivotal molecular pathways and gene targets for salivary gland malignancy development. Collective these approaches will lead to translational and mechanistic insights for salivary tumor development that can be further translated for clinical applications as well as mechanistic evaluations using rodent models for salivary gland carcinogenesis.  Six Specific Aims are in place to test the hypothesis in this application. Aim 1 is to procure fresh frozen malignant and benign parotid gland tissues from the UCLA Head & Neck Oncology Clinic. Aim 2 is to perform comprehensive profiling of parotid gland tumors' transcriptome; microRNA and epigenome using most advanced RNA sequencing and methylomics arrays. Aim 3 will perform statistical and bioinformatics analysis for the omics databases to select candidate biomarkers that can detect parotid gland malignancies. These candidate biomarkers will be pre-validated in Aim 4 in an independent cohort of parotid gland malignant and benign tumors. Aim 5 is to explore the hypothesis that tissue-based dysregulated biomarkers in malignant parotid glands are concordantly dysregulated in saliva of these patients. Finally Aim 6 is a systems network based analysis of the omics databases to identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are pivotal in the development of parotid gland malignancies. These pathway and targets outcome can be evaluated in future mechanistic studies in salivary gland malignancy development by rodent models or cell lines.  Our multidisciplinary research team has the expertise and track record to carry out the proposed molecular characterization of parotid gland tumors as well as expertise to carryout the mechanistic and translational next steps to fully materialize the goals of this RFA.  8. Relevance to Public Health Statement  Salivary gland tumors are rare. However, they are aggressive and fatal. Due to its rarity (1-6% of head and neck cancers) and the fact that there are 24 variants of salivary gland cancers and 13 variants of benign subtypes, clinical diagnosis of salivary gland tumor is one of the worst, hampering treatment decisions and prognostics outcomes of patients. This application takes the novel and impactful approach to generate the most comprehensive molecular profile of salivary gland tumors to develop molecular signatures of salivary gland malignancies, saliva based biomarkers for early detection of salivary gland cancers and informatics outcomes that will identify critical biological pathways and gene targets that are involved in the mechanistic development of salivary gland malignancies. The outcomes of this application are molecular signatures of parotid gland cancer to assist clinical diagnosis; salivary biomarkers to assist early detection of salivary gland cancers and identified biological pathways and gene targets for mechanistic evaluation in rodent models for salivary gland tumor carcinogenesis.",Molecular Characterization of Parotid Gland Tumors,8534892,R56DE023241,"['Abbreviations', 'Acinar Cell Carcinoma', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma', 'Adenolymphoma', 'Basic Science', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of salivary gland', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Parotid Cancer', 'Parotid Gland', 'Parotid Neoplasms', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Public Health', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rodent Model', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms', 'Salivary Glands', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Unresectable', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'abstracting', 'adenoma', 'antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity', 'base', 'biobank', 'bisulfite', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'density', 'epigenomics', 'insight', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R56,2012,211387,0.06024434420682082
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma  ABSTRACT Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents.  Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.",Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma,8271303,R01CA135509,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors', 'Angiogenesis Promoter', 'Antigens', 'Apoptosis', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Facies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'STAT3 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'VHL mutation', 'Vascular Endothelial Cell', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'angiogenesis', 'bHLH-PAS factor HLF', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer therapy', 'caspase-3', 'cell behavior', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'intercellular communication', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2012,447222,0.1078895281554834
"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,8020024,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2011,337641,0.11467138353001702

As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7760605,R01NS042645,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preventive', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neoplastic', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'programs', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2010,341087,0.11467138353001702
"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Multiresolution-fractal modeling for brain tumor detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI's long-term research goal is to develop a fully functional automated robust CAD tool for accurate  pediatric brain tumor volume segmentation and tracking over time. Note the current practice in brain tumor  volume segmentation involves manual tracing and segmentation of suspected tumor areas in multimodality MRI  which is time consuming, labor intensive, and may be imprecise.  In an effort to reduce cognitive sequelae, contemporary protocols employ risk-adapted therapy in which risk  stratification is based on volume of residual tumor after surgical resection and presence of metastatic disease at  diagnosis. Therefore, further improvement in cancer treatment outcome in children is unlikely to be achieved  without improved knowledge of tumor volume and classification among other factors. In addition, such automated  volume computation and tracking tool would be of value as an adjunct marker in following up patients with brain  tumors. This will, in turn, help the physicians to make important patient management decisions about surgery  planning, critical radiation treatment planning modifications, treatment field modifications, localized control, sites  of metastatic disease and post therapy response evaluation.  However, development of such automated and precise tumor volume segmentation CAD tool requires solution to  a few challenges such as detection of hard-to-detect brain tumor (small residual after surgery, poorly  enhanced, multi foci and irregularly shaped) and abnormalities (edema, necrosis, and larger resection  cavity due to surgery) detection and classification. This project aims at development, testing, and evaluation  of innovative techniques and tools that will assist feature-based detection, segmentation and classification of  brain tumor and a few specific abnormalities.} The specific aims of this project are: 1) Spline-multiresolution  wavelet-fractal feature extraction; 2) MR sequence-dependant feature fusion and tumor/abnormality size and  volume determination for improved detection; 3) Optimized feature fusion for improved tumor, tissue and  abnormality classification; and 4) Algorithm testing and validation. {If successful, our method will allow for the  automatic computation of brain tumors and abnormalities with improved accuracy, which can provide a rapid,  objective, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the disease.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR. Finally, the molecular classifiers will be tested using prospectively acquired biopsy samples on tissues of known and unknown sites of origin.           n/a",Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors,7903971,R01CA112215,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Antibodies', 'Biliary', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Line', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Adenocarcinoma', 'Community Hospitals', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Endoscopy', 'Ensure', 'Esophageal', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Fine needle aspiration biopsy', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Adenocarcinoma', 'Metastatic Lesion', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Microfluidics', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pancreas', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stomach', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aurora kinase', 'base', 'bile duct', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'gene discovery', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'performance site', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'stem', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Algorithmic strategies for detecting structural variation in genomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fine-scale nucleotide changes, along with genetic recombination, are often cited as the major source of human genetic variation [1, 13, 14]. Less is known about larger scale (> 10kb) genomic structural variations. As genomic technologies improve, we are detecting structural variation in ever-increasing numbers, including genomic inversions [24, 48, 71, 65, 31]; insertion/deletion polymorphisms [12, 26, 42]; and, copy number polymorphisms [28, 59, 60]. These large variations can completely disrupt coding and regulatory sites and copy number of genes, and thereby have a huge impact on human phenotypes and disease susceptibility [23, 61]. Deleterious effects have indeed been observed in cancer and other diseases [70, 43]. Our understanding of the scale and impact of these variations can be enhanced by improving computational tools for mining the data from these technologies. Here, I propose the development of algorithms and computational tools to improve detection and resolution (location of breakpoints) of structural variation. Specifically, I will develop algorithms for (a) experimental design of sequencing projects for detecting and resolving structural variations; (b) fine-mapping of breakpoints using end sequence profiling, to detect gene-disruption and gene-fusions; (c) reconstructing tumor genome architectures; (d) detection of targeted genomic variations in a heterogeneous mix of normal versus mutated cells via multiplex PCR; and (e) detection of balanced structural variation in genotype data. The tools will be designed using techniques from statistical machine learning and combinatorial algorithms. Validation will be performed using known structural variations, simulation studies, and extensive experimental collaborations with technology developers and early technology adopters. All of the data, and software will be freely available for academic and non-commercial uses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed computational tools will be used to detect structural variations in human populations as a starting point for understanding their role in normal evolution and disease, specifically cancer. The architecture of tumor genomes will help reveal genes that are disrupted and differentially expressed in tumor cells.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment.

"Computer Assisted Identification and Volumetric Analysis of Enhancing Components    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of volumetric change of enhancing tissue is regarded as an important parameter used by clinicians when seeking to monitor the response of brain neoplasms to therapy. Unfortunately, direct computation of enhancing volume requires the manual tracing and segmentation of areas of enhancement typically extending over multiple images, which is time consuming, labor intensive, and therefore impractical. Substitute methods are widely utilized (such as bi-directional measurements). Such surrogate measurements for tumor volume become problematic. Our long-term goal is to seek an objective, computer aided diagnostic (CAD) methodology for automatic computation of tumor (enhancing tissue) volume relevant for clinical decision making. Our hypothesis behind this project is that volume of enhancing tissue can be accurately measured through the use of advanced computer vision techniques, which will lead to an effective CAD system able to assist radiologists analyzing MR brain images.   The specific aims of the proposed project are 1) to improve the accuracy of the measurement of enhancing tissue by constructing high resolution 3D MR images and labeling enhancing tissue using learning based computer vision techniques, and 2) to develop a CAD system for enhancing tissue volume assessment using the designed techniques and evaluate the performance of the system on assisting radiologists for image interpretation.    We believe this system will be well suited for use in patients undergoing treatment protocols/clinical trials who require short term serial imaging. It will better enable radiologists to give accurate quantitative clinical information. If the proposed research is completed successfully, the determination of enhancing tissue volume will be significantly advanced. It will enable the radiologists to rapidly provide objective, accurate, reproducible, and easily reported assessment of the tumor status. This will lead to a more rapid and reproducible assessment of neoplasm and therefore, hopefully influence patient outcomes in a positive way. The proposed research will also be applicable for usage on archived studies thereby enabling the volume of enhancing tissue to be calculated on these images as well.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this research is to develop a more accurate and reproducible way to measure the amount of disease present in patients suffering from brain tumors. Measurement methods currently being used are limited in accuracy, reproducibility and efficiency and hence we propose a method, if successful, will enable the computer to identify and measure brain tumors in a more automated fashion with improved accuracy.

"Chip-Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors PROVIDED.  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment.

"Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Statistical atlases, and associated image analysis methods, have found widespread use in several neuroimaging fields, presenting a powerful way to integrate diverse imaging information, correlate it with genetic and clinical measurements, understand effects of disease on brain structure and function, and construct diagnostic tools. This proposal will combine statistical image analysis, deformable registration, and biophysical modeling approaches to an integrated framework for constructing and clinically using statistical atlases from brain tumor patients. Emphasis is placed on gliomas, which have very poor prognosis due to cancer infiltration beyond the visible tumor boundary. Accordingly, the ultimate clinical goal of this study is to identify subtle imaging characteristics of brain tissue that is likely to be infiltrated by tumor, as well as of tissue that is likely to present recurrence in relatively shorter time period. This will be achieved by studying the multi-modal imaging phenotypes of healthy and pathologic tissues in conjunction with spatial information, including the spatial pattern of the tumor and the proximity of malignant tissue to white matter fiber pathways, and by correlating these phenotypes with clinical information, including tumor recurrence. The hypothesis is that signal and spatial information together will be able to identify brain tissues that are likely to later present recurrence. The main technical challenges that will be overcome are 1) development of computationally efficient biophysical models of tumor growth, diffusion, and mass effect; 2) development of deformable registration methods that will allow us to co-register tumor-bearing brain images and build a population-based atlas-the main challenges here are to estimate the appropriate tumor parameters as well as the location of peri-tumor anatomy that is typically confounded by edema, infiltration and extreme deformations; and 3) development of machine learning methods for characterizing subtle abnormalities of brain tissue, and for identifying tissue that is likely to present recurrence after resection and treatment. Pilot studies on the feasibility of this approach to larger clinical studies will be performed on a database of brain MR images obtained from glioma patients via a rich and extensive acquisition protocol, including perfusion, diffusion tensor imaging, spectroscopy, and conventional imaging.           n/a",Statistical atlases of brain tumor MRI:do imaging phenotypes predict progression?,7369127,R01NS042645,"['Aggressive course', 'Aging', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Edema', 'Excision', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infiltration', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cancer cell', 'cancer recurrence', 'image registration', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor progression', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2008,344531,0.11467138353001702
"Chip Based Diagnosis of Problematic Liver Tumors    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise tumor diagnosis and classification is the first step in cancer management. While many tumor biopsies are diagnostic and form the cornerstone of cancer therapy, classification of tumor type and site of origin, is an ever-present clinical challenge. It is estimated that up to 10% of all tumors have no defined primary site of origin and that thousands of dollars are spent per case to identify the site of origin with limited overall success. The current standard of pathologic practice, using morphologic criteria and a panel of semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses, is often limited in its capacity to define tumor type or site of origin. Moreover, the diagnosis of metastatic lesions can be quite difficult when no primary site of origin has been identified (unknown primary cancers). Since therapy is often based on site of origin, there is a clear need for the identification and validation of a classifier that will cleanly distinguish these histologically similar tumor types and augment standard pathological techniques in making the diagnostic call. We have recently demonstrated the feasibility of using gene expression profiling to discriminate 21 different tumor types with an accuracy of 88%. The performance of this classifier, however, was principally limited by the use of multiple platforms for analysis. This proposal seeks to build a new gene expression classifier on a single, commercially available, genome-wide oligonucleotide platform, with a focus on the most problematic primary and metastatic tumors of the liver. To demonstrate the clinical utility of this approach, we plan to validate the classifier with independent test sets that will also be profiled by standard IHC approaches; the results of molecular classification will then be compared head to head with standard pathological classification for accuracy of diagnosis. To further translate the technology, we will select core classifier genes and perform validation with real time quantitative PCR.

"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.

"Direct MALDI-ToF analysis of LCM-selected tissue & tumor DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In order to improve the quality of differential cancer diagnostics and metastatic tumor origination using protein and carbohydrate biomarker detection of patient biopsies, BioAnalyte Inc. and collaborators at MGH and JHMI propose to develop laser capture microdissection (LCM) as a sample preparation system for the biomolecular profiling capabilities of MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry. The work will first optimize protocols for collecting cells from mammalian tissue for MALDI-ToF analysis. For differential diagnostics we will analyze several LCM-selected cells from the tumor collection at MGH representing a variety of cancers will be used to determine the MALDI-ToF profiles of transformed and adjoining normal tissue. For identification of a metastatic tumor with its primary, we will make MALDI-ToF MS profiles of LCM-selected cells from metastatic cancers and compare them to profiles of LCM-selected cells in the original tissue. New software about written for general MALDI-ToF chemometric analysis of profiles WII be implemented here to determine fingerprint regions of the mass spectra in each of its applications.

"CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Neuroblastoma is the       most common extra cranial tumor of childhood, and cases are highly               heterogenous with regard to clinical behavior.  Although patient groups with     different expected survivals can be identified by clinical staging at            diagnosis, individual clinically defined risk groups include patients with       quite different outcomes.  Inter- and intra-stage diversity provides             opportunities for identifying molecular genetic and biologic properties of       tumors that are associated with treatment outcome.  Such correlations can        identify risk groups that otherwise are not recognizable, thus aiding in the     interpretation of clinical studies, and they can provide new criteria for        more appropriate therapy assignment.  They may also suggest new approaches       to therapy.  The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop tests      that improve definition of risk groups so that the most appropriate and          effective therapy can be given to each patient.                                                                                                                   The hypothesis of this application is that subsets of neuroblastomas can be      identified by evaluating (1) genes that are critically involved in               neuroblastoma growth, differentiation, and survival and (2) the ability of       tumor cells to grow continuously in vitro.  Plans are to build upon previous     studies of N-myc proto-oncogene expression in neuroblastoma and of the           neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, NGF, and brain derived neurotrophic          factor, BDNF) and their receptors (e.g., TrkAl), and of tumor cell growth in     vitro, which demonstrated the potential importance of these markers in           prognostication.                                                                                                                                                  The specific aims are as follows:  (1) determine if tumor phenotype defined      by MYCN gene amplification and expression, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA       expression, and growth in vitro correlates with disease progression during       or after therapy; (2) develop multivariate statistical models for predicting     outcome based upon clinical presentation (stage and age) and laboratory data     (tumor MYCN gene amplification, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA expression,      growth in vitro, and histopathology); (3) determine in a pilot study if          expression of other neurotrophins and their receptors defines risk groups.       If so, include these in the above analyses.                                                                                                                       The CCG performs phase III studies in which newly diagnosed patients receive     therapy according to risk classification, which is currently based upon          clinical stage, age, histopathology, and N-myc gene amplification status.        Approximately 200 patients are registered annually in studies for low,           intermediate, and high-risk neuroblastoma.  Tumor tissues including (in some     patients) bone marrow with tumor are obtained at diagnosis prospectively.        Tumors are tested to determine their phenotype with regard to N-myc              amplification, trk RNA expression level and pattern of expression, BDNF RNA      expression, telomerase RNA expression and activity, chromosome 1p deletions,     and tumor cell growth in vitro.  The goal is to determine if these               laboratory test results can identify clinically important but small subsets      of patients who may benefit from different therapy.  If preliminary studies      indicate that specific tests are particularly important in predicting            prognosis, large-scale studies will be conducted to better define the value      of these new tests (e.g., their ability to identify patients who will likely     fail treatment).                                                                                                                                                  It is anticipated that these studies will improve prognostication and that       they may contribute to development of novel and possibly more effective          therapies for high-risk patients, while diminishing the risks of treatment       for low risk patients.                                                            n/a",CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA,6403183,R01CA060104,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' cooperative study', ' gene expression', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' molecular oncology', ' neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neuroblastoma', ' neurotrophic factors', ' pediatric neoplasm /cancer', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' protooncogene', ' receptor expression', ' telomerase', ' telomere', ' tumor suppressor genes']",NCI,NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION,R01,2001,420741,0.0650030322241608

For both the surgeon and the                     interventionalist, it would be enormously valuable to provide a 3D map that          contains the tumor margins, that illustrates 3D parent-child vascular                connectivity information, that shows the relationship between arteries and           veins in AVMs, and that readily segregates vascular branches supplying a tumor       from branches supplying normal brain. These kinds of information are those that      the clinican most needs to know. Such information is not directly available to       clinicians by any current imaging methodology.                                                                                                                            The specific aims of this proposal include: 1) segmentation of solid tumors          from MR, 2) segmentation of AVMs from magnetic resonance angiograms (MRA) and        MR, 3) registration of MR with MRA data, 4) development of methods of vascular       desbription to separate arteries from veins and to delineate which arterial          branches (and descendents) supply only tumor and which supply brain, and 5)          tests of the accuracy and utility of our methodology.                                                                                                                     In addition to its clinical goals, this proposal aims to meet a number of            challenges in computer vision research, including tumor segmentation using a         range of cues, a statistical atlas based definition of named vessels, and            automated definition of vessel branchpoints. The methods we propose are              unavailable elsewhere and should be profoundly useful to clinicians. We propose      a number of studies to evaluate the accuracy and utility of our approach, and        we also propose new visualization methods to indicate the uncertainty of our         symbolic descriptions of image objects. n/a",3D Cerebral vessel location for surgical planning,6324990,R01CA067812,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' blood vessel disorder', ' brain neoplasms', ' cardiovascular disorder diagnosis', ' cardiovascular surgery', ' cerebrovascular imaging /visualization', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' image processing', ' magnetic resonance imaging', ' neoplasm /cancer blood supply', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer surgery', ' neurosurgery']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2001,355229,0.059784734820253344
"COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING The overall goal is to optimize the design of medical imaging systems and reconstruction algorithms for the purposes of tumor detection in humans and animals.  For imaging systems this is done by devising efficient methods to calculate the performance of ideal observers that use the noisy data from the system on realistic tumor detections tasks.  These methods make use of symmetries of the imaging system, consistency conditions on the data, and constraints on the objects to simplify the computations.  Noise models are chosen to reflect the measurement noise in the system, the background variation in the patient population, and the normal variation in tumor characteristics. Performance of ideal observers is determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.  For a given detection task, this performance is a function of the parameters in the system design.  By varying these parameters the optimal design for tumor detection is found by maximizing this figure of merit.  When the ideal observer performance is too difficult to compute, the ideal linear observer is substituted.  For reconstruction algorithms, the performance of linear mathematical observers using the reconstructed images for tumor detection tasks is computed.  These model observers are chosen to match the performance of human observers on similar tasks.  To compute the performance of these observers, the first-order and second-order statistics of the reconstructed images are calculated or approximated.  These statistical moments are then used to compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the model observer on the given tumor detection task.  Of particular interest is the role of redundant data and null functions of the imaging system in the deterministic and statistical properties of the reconstruction algorithms.  n/a",COMPUTING TUMOR DETECTION PERFORMANCE IN MEDICAL IMAGING,6165674,K01CA087017,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' imaging /visualization /scanning', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' performance', ' statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K01,2000,117073,0.08433328807682987
"TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality       in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is      less than 15%.  Pathologic stage I makes up  25-35% of NSCLC cases and has       a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is      35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of           several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful        in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this            project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage       I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I           NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of             positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                         Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers        and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will       identify potential serum tumor markers.                                                                                                                           Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a           retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                 categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers          (Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity         (angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of         cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results        will be used to develop a prediction rule for recurrence in stage I NSCLC        using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and an artificial neural      network.                                                                                                                                                          Specific aim #2 will examine a set of eight serum tumor markers in a             retrospective cohort of 250 patients with stage I to IV NSCLC.  These            markers are categorized as molecular genetic markers (anti-p53), markers of      metastatic propensity (angiogenesis bFGF), somatamedins (growth factor IGF-      1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-       1, CD44).  The purpose of this aim is to identify any correlations between       titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred         patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor                resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before         and after cyto-reduction.  Significant correlates with tumor stage and mass      will be evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC.                                                                                         In specific aim #3, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tumor tissue will be      collected from a prospective cohort of 330 patients with stage I NSCLC to        validate the prediction rule developed in specific aim #1.  In these same        patients, serial serum specimens will be collected for a minimum of 2.0          years after resection (specific aim #4).  The significant markers                identified in specific aim #2 will be analyzed in this cohort to describe        correlations with tumor recurrence.  Tissue and serum markers identified by      the model can be used to select high risk patients for a prospective,            multi-institutional chemotherapy trial for stage I NSCLC.                         n/a",TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE,6172943,R29CA073980,"['angiogenesis factor', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' cell differentiation', ' clinical research', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' genetic markers', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' insulinlike growth factor', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' metastasis', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer', ' prognosis', ' respiratory surgery', ' serology /serodiagnosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,105136,0.033173773076155606
"CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract):  Neuroblastoma is the       most common extra cranial tumor of childhood, and cases are highly               heterogenous with regard to clinical behavior.  Although patient groups with     different expected survivals can be identified by clinical staging at            diagnosis, individual clinically defined risk groups include patients with       quite different outcomes.  Inter- and intra-stage diversity provides             opportunities for identifying molecular genetic and biologic properties of       tumors that are associated with treatment outcome.  Such correlations can        identify risk groups that otherwise are not recognizable, thus aiding in the     interpretation of clinical studies, and they can provide new criteria for        more appropriate therapy assignment.  They may also suggest new approaches       to therapy.  The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to develop tests      that improve definition of risk groups so that the most appropriate and          effective therapy can be given to each patient.                                                                                                                   The hypothesis of this application is that subsets of neuroblastomas can be      identified by evaluating (1) genes that are critically involved in               neuroblastoma growth, differentiation, and survival and (2) the ability of       tumor cells to grow continuously in vitro.  Plans are to build upon previous     studies of N-myc proto-oncogene expression in neuroblastoma and of the           neurotrophins (nerve growth factor, NGF, and brain derived neurotrophic          factor, BDNF) and their receptors (e.g., TrkAl), and of tumor cell growth in     vitro, which demonstrated the potential importance of these markers in           prognostication.                                                                                                                                                  The specific aims are as follows:  (1) determine if tumor phenotype defined      by MYCN gene amplification and expression, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA       expression, and growth in vitro correlates with disease progression during       or after therapy; (2) develop multivariate statistical models for predicting     outcome based upon clinical presentation (stage and age) and laboratory data     (tumor MYCN gene amplification, TrkA expression, telomerase RNA expression,      growth in vitro, and histopathology); (3) determine in a pilot study if          expression of other neurotrophins and their receptors defines risk groups.       If so, include these in the above analyses.                                                                                                                       The CCG performs phase III studies in which newly diagnosed patients receive     therapy according to risk classification, which is currently based upon          clinical stage, age, histopathology, and N-myc gene amplification status.        Approximately 200 patients are registered annually in studies for low,           intermediate, and high-risk neuroblastoma.  Tumor tissues including (in some     patients) bone marrow with tumor are obtained at diagnosis prospectively.        Tumors are tested to determine their phenotype with regard to N-myc              amplification, trk RNA expression level and pattern of expression, BDNF RNA      expression, telomerase RNA expression and activity, chromosome 1p deletions,     and tumor cell growth in vitro.  The goal is to determine if these               laboratory test results can identify clinically important but small subsets      of patients who may benefit from different therapy.  If preliminary studies      indicate that specific tests are particularly important in predicting            prognosis, large-scale studies will be conducted to better define the value      of these new tests (e.g., their ability to identify patients who will likely     fail treatment).                                                                                                                                                  It is anticipated that these studies will improve prognostication and that       they may contribute to development of novel and possibly more effective          therapies for high-risk patients, while diminishing the risks of treatment       for low risk patients.                                                            n/a",CLINICAL CORRELATIVE STUDIES OF NEUROBLASTOMA,6150147,R01CA060104,"['adolescence (12-20)', ' artificial intelligence', ' cancer risk', ' child (0-11)', ' clinical research', ' cooperative study', ' gene expression', ' growth factor receptors', ' human subject', ' human therapy evaluation', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' molecular oncology', ' neoplasm /cancer chemotherapy', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neuroblastoma', ' neurotrophic factors', ' pediatric neoplasm /cancer', ' polymerase chain reaction', ' protooncogene', ' receptor expression', ' telomerase', ' telomere', ' tumor suppressor genes']",NCI,NATIONAL CHILDHOOD CANCER FOUNDATION,R01,2000,413515,0.0650030322241608

"Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive malignant adult brain tumor, with grim prognosis and heterogeneous molecular and imaging profiles. Although the currently applicable treatment options (i.e., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) have expanded during the last 20 years, there is no substantial improvement in the OS rates. The major obstacle in treating GBM patients is the heterogeneity of their molecular landscape. Determination of molecular targets requires ex vivo postoperative tissue analyses, which are limited in assessing the tumor's spatial heterogeneity (sampling error due to single sample histopathological and molecular analysis) and temporal heterogeneity (not possible to continuously assess the molecular transformation of the tumor during treatment). Herein we propose to develop quantitative imaging phenomic (QIP) markers of a range of mutations of interest in GB. We will build on prior work on EGFR, IDH1 mutations and MGMT methylation QIP signatures, and develop an extensive panel of imaging signatures of 10 gene mutations, as well as MGMT promoter methylation, using machine learning methods applied to relatively routine clinical mpMRI (standard plus diffusion tensor and perfusion protocols). Availability of such biomarkers can contribute to non-invasive i) patient stratification into appropriate treatments, ii) measurement of individual molecular characteristics. In particular, we propose to carry out the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 (SA1): To develop the enabling methodologies for constructing Quantitative Imaging Phenomic signatures of GB mutations Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Establish QIP signatures of 10 mutations of interest in gliomas, plus MGMT promoter status, using next generation sequencing (NGS). We will use 709 datasets. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Characterize the molecular heterogeneity of GB using QIP signatures, leveraging the NGS samples of SA1, as well as a new sample that we will genotype, adding to a total of 600 tumor samples obtained from 4 different locations per patient from 150 patients. The first 150 tissue samples are already analyzed as part of ongoing work. Specific Aim 4 (SA4): Integrate our methods into the Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk), in order to allow easy access to them by users This project will investigate the relationship between imaging characteristics of glioblastoma and its underlying genetic mutations/variants. As such, it aims to develop a number of imaging signatures of mutations that are important in GBM, using 1,159 (709 patients plus an additional 450 tissue samples of 150 of these patients obtained from different locations in the tumor) analyzed via next generation sequencing. The primary motivation of this work is to develop the imaging analytics methodologies and associated biomarkers that will allow us to evaluate the spatial, temporal and molecular heterogeneity of glioblastoma, thereby assisting in patient stratification and treatment.",Imaging signatures of genetic mutations in glioblastoma using machine learning,9893291,R01NS042645,"['Adult', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'MGMT gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Postoperative Period', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiogenomics', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'next generation sequencing', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'phenomics', 'predictive signature', 'programs', 'promoter', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'receptor', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670422,0.05290561328924453
"Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma Project Summary Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary adult brain tumor with an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100,000 people. Due to its heterogeneous genetic characteristics, GBM carries a dismal prognosis, with a median survival of only 14 months and five-year survival rates are less than 10%. The current standard of care is maximal safe surgical resection, chemoradiation, and adjuvant temozolomide. Within the natural history of GBM, there are adaptive genetic changes within the tumor that lead to treatment resistance and inevitable recurrence, leading to patient death. While a variety of treatments can be administered for tumor recurrence, there is currently no consensus on therapy for recurrent tumor as none have been proven to provide substantial survival benefit. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. Rather, clinical decision-making is based on a manual and variable two- dimensional measure of tumor burden, a surrogate of tumor volume, and genetic characterization of select molecular markers at the time of initial surgery. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care. Thus, a critical need exists for automatic methods that non-invasively evaluate treatment efficacy on a patient-to-patient basis. To address this problem, we will develop a novel solution based on deep learning that leverages structural, diffusion, and perfusion information from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging. At the core of our solution is a convolutional neural network; a machine learning technique that can be trained on raw image data to predict clinical outputs of interest. Firstly, we will develop a fully automatic technique for longitudinal tracking of tumor volumes. To do this, we will develop novel deep learning architectures through incorporation of state-of-the-art neural network components that can segment both whole tumor and tumor subregions (edema, non-enhancing tumor, and gadolinium contrast-enhancing tumor). To prove algorithm utility, we will automatically derive tumor volumes in a longitudinal patient cohort and correlate volumes with clinical outcomes. Secondly, we will develop a non-invasive, deep learning algorithm for evaluation of regional genetic characteristics of GBM. To train this algorithm, we will acquire imaging-localized surgical biopsies and genetic profiling of GBM patients undergoing surgery. Once trained, the algorithm can be used to non- invasively identify clonal populations and track genetic changes associated with clinical outcomes during the course of treatment. The development of these deep learning algorithms will transform physician’s capacity for clinical decision-making and dramatically improve outcomes for a devastating disease. Project Narrative The proposed research will provide automatic deep-learning tools to aid clinical decision-making for glioblastoma, the most common primary adult brain tumor that carries a dismal prognosis. The major limitation of the current treatment strategy is that clinicians do not have a reliable method of longitudinally assessing tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics of the tumor during the course of treatment. A tool that can automatically assess tumor volumes and regional genetic characteristics longitudinally will substantially improve evaluation of treatment efficacy, allowing for an earlier switch to alternative treatment strategies and thus, more personalized tailoring of patient care and enhancement of clinical outcomes.",Automatic Volumetric Treatment Response Assessment and Determination of Regional Genetic Characteristics in Glioblastoma,9956590,F30CA239407,"['Address', 'Adjuvant', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Gadolinium', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Glioblastoma', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Perfusion Weighted MRI', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Radiogenomics', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Volume', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Woman', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'career', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'mutational status', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'standard of care', 'temozolomide', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F30,2020,50520,0.1261937020984376
"Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics Abstract The diagnosis of primary brain tumors requires a layered approach of histologic, anatomic and molecular features to generate an integrated diagnosis with clinical and prognostic significance. The diagnostic workup of diffuse gliomas in particular requires a panel of immunohistochemical stains with a subset of tumors requiring additional molecular testing to reach a diagnostic category recognized by the World Health Organization. In the United States and worldwide, scarce resources are available to perform these tests, so methods that improve pre-test probabilities and decrease false positive results have significant clinical and financial impact. Our long-term goal is to improve and standardize testing and diagnoses for brain tumor patients worldwide by validating new diagnostic workflows using digital imaging, immunohistochemical tests, open source computing platforms and machine learning algorithms to improve diagnostic capabilities. We will achieve these goals by completing three specific aims in this R03 Pilot/Feasibility project. First, we will determine the extent to which predictive diagnostic models developed from public domain data show generalizability to cases evaluated at a tertiary brain cancer care center. We have already generated a prototype statistical predictive model, which we will expand to all CNS tumor types and test with data from patients at James Cancer Hospital. Second, we will generate and validate models that predict the probability of false-positive 1p/19q FISH testing using histological features from OLIG2-immunostained brain tumor slides obtained from whole slide imaging. Lastly, we will consolidate data containing whole slide digital images, immunohistochemical features, clinical data and molecular features of diffuse gliomas. Consolidating these data will allow us to begin data analysis correlating histological images to immunohistochemical and molecular features. This dataset will represent the core dataset that upon which we will base our next R01-level proposal. To achieve these goals, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team composed of an image analysis expert and neuropathologist (JO), a molecular neuropathologist (DT), and a high dimensionality bioinformaticist (JZ). The Ohio State University is the first US cancer center to transition to complete whole slide imaging, and therefore we are in a unique position to generate a significant, vertical advance in improving diagnostic accuracy in neuropathology with modern Pathology Informatics approaches. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop predictive models of cancer diagnoses and consolidate various forms of patient data into one centralized source for research. This new knowledge will ultimately serve as the framework upon which interventions are designed that may improve morbidity and mortality of patients with primary brain tumors. Therefore, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burdens of human disease.",Implementation of Machine Learning Workflows in Primary Brain Tumor Diagnostics,9954242,R03NS116334,"['19q', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CDKN2A gene', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'FDA approved', 'Geographic state', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Ohio', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Probability', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'histological image', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'mutant', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic significance', 'prototype', 'sequencing platform', 'therapy design', 'tumor', 'whole slide imaging']",NINDS,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,156000,0.041208659269017484
"Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are one heterogeneous type of cancer affecting most organ systems. NETs must be correctly graded to ensure proper treatment and patient management. The proliferation index, as measured by Ki67 nuclear staining, is required for gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic NET grading per the criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Measuring the Ki67 labeling index (Ki67 LI) from pathology images requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This process is an essential procedure in basic, translational and clinical research and in routine clinical practice. However, current Ki67 image analysis tools have a number of drawbacks: 1) Ki67 LI assessment is still mainly achieved with manual or semi-automated methods, leading to increased labor costs, awkward workflows, low-throughput image analysis and significant potential inter- and intra-observer variability; 2) computer-aided Ki67 counting is error-prone due to the multi-stage image processing design, where each stage itself is a very challenging task; 3) current algorithm design does not take into consideration the characteristics of Ki67 images such that it has technical difficulty in classifying different types of cells in Ki67 stained images. In this proposed research, we seek to develop and disseminate a novel deep learning-based imaging informatics system, KiNeT, specifically for better automated Ki67 LI measurement in GI and pancreatic NETs. KiNet will take advantage of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, deep fully convolutional networks (FCNs), to develop an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel model for single-stage Ki67 LI assessment. To this end, we will first formulate Ki67 counting as a cell identification problem and solve it using class-aware structured regression modeling within a novel FCN network. This network will simultaneously detect and classify immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. Next, we will further enhance cell identification with another related task, extraction of regions of interest (ROIs), which will differentiate tumor from non-tumor regions by taking Ki67 image characteristics into consideration. These two tasks will be unified into one single neural network and jointly learned to benefit both cell identification and region classification. KiNet will provide a novel computational method for accurate Ki67 LI assessment, thereby enabling early detection and targeted treatments of the diseases. Compared to manual counting and current Ki67 image analysis methods, it will significantly improve the objectivity, consistency, reliability, reproducibility and efficiency. Additionally, the proposed single-stage Ki67 counting strategy, which is completely different from current multi-stage Ki67 image analysis pipelines, will provide a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ki67 labeling index (LI) is a reliable and critical biomarker to grade gastrointestinal (GI) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This biomarker computation requires accurate quantification of immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor and non-tumor cells. This proposed research is to develop and disseminate a novel advanced machine learning-based imaging informatics system to better quantify Ki67 images for effective and efficient single-stage Ki67 LI assessment for GI and pancreatic NETs.",Development and Dissemination of KiNet: A Novel Imaging Informatics Tool for Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,9905506,R21CA237493,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Nuclear', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Siblings', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'adaptation algorithm', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gastrointestinal', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'informatics tool', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multi-task learning', 'network architecture', 'network models', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2020,202928,0.10387704683029658
"Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response Abstract  The continuing goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective imaging-based strategies to personalize brain tumor treatment. Current Response Assessment in NeuroOncology (RANO) criteria, which incorporate anatomic imaging only, are insufficient for distinguishing tumor from treatment effect (TE). Without definitive confirmation of tumor progression, no treatment changes are recommended for several months after standard therapies. Thus, patients are precluded from switching to potentially more effective therapies—a limitation that could be overcome with more reliable imaging techniques.  To this end, during the previous funding cycle, we demonstrated the feasibility of several quantitative imaging (QI) tools to reliably distinguish tumor from treatment effect and predict treatment response. These QI tools include a machine-learning approach to calibrate T1w images enabling the creation of quantitative delta T1 (qDT1) maps. The qDT1 enable the detection of true contrast enhancing lesion volume (CELV). The qDT1 together with our proven dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI methods, for determination of rCBV (relative cerebral blood volume), are used to generate a new biomarker, fractional tumor burden (FTB), to delineate the extent of tumor within CELV on a voxel-wise basis. These perfusion-based QI tools in combination with our diffusion MRI technology, which includes functional diffusion maps (FDMs) and more recently RSI (restriction spectrum imaging), provide a comprehensive assessment of brain tumor and its distinction from treatment effect.  Now, in order to translate this technology for use in clinical trials and daily practice, some final updates and clinical validation studies are needed as proposed here. First, to ease adoption and testing in the clinical setting improvements are proposed for the individual QI technologies along with the development of a streamlined workflow (Aim 1). To improve the widespread adoption of DSC-MRI and FTB biomarker, studies will be performed to confirm that a single-dose DSC-MRI method can replace the standard double-dose method without affecting the accuracy of rCBV or the creation of FTB maps (Aim 1.1). Also, registration and segmentation algorithms will be updated to include deformable registration and recent advances in deep learning for longitudinal reporting of CELV, non-enhancing lesion volumes (NELV) and each of the QI metrics (Aim 1.2). Finally, a streamlined workflow that incorporates these improvements will be created (Aim 1.3). The Aim 2 studies will test the QI tools and workflow using clinical trial data (Aim 2.1-2.2) and daily clinical practice (Aim 2.3-2.4).  Clinical validation of this new QI-RANO workflow, with evidence showing improved prediction in comparison to current measures, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how brain tumor burden is assessed. Project Narrative The goal of our research program is to optimize and disseminate effective quantitative imaging (QI)-based strategies to provide earlier indications of brain tumor treatment response than is currently available. The QI tools, which include novel quantitative measures of enhancing lesion (qDT1), relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV), fractional tumor burden (FTB) and functional diffusion maps (fDM) will be updated and validated in the context of clinical trials. Working in close collaboration with an industrial partner, the proven methods will be translated into a software platform for widespread use within the quantitative imaging network (QIN), and for both clinical trials and daily standard of care.",Quantitative (Perfusion and Diffusion) MRI Biomarkers to Measure Glioma Response,10006506,U01CA176110,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Funding', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Update', 'Validation', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'cerebral blood volume', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neuro-oncology', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'validation studies']",NCI,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,U01,2020,559217,0.08057520184920727
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells. Outcomes from this project are expected to improve the efficacy and precision of cancer immunotherapies.",Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells,10051274,R01CA245318,"['Adopted', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Autologous', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD28 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cellular immunotherapy', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Expression Profiling', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'HLA-A gene', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Human', 'IL2RA gene', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunodeficient Mouse', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Innate Immune System', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Methods', 'Oncogenes', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Expansion', 'Tumor stage', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Validation', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer treatment', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical application', 'complementarity-determining region 3', 'deep learning', 'design', 'gag Gene Products', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predictive marker', 'receptor', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'side effect', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'software development', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,374006,0.01317266868360102
"Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment Project Summary/Abstract  Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is likely to grow even more in the next decade given the epidemic levels of hepatitis B and C and the emergence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) due to obesity in the US. Most liver cancer patients present with disease that cannot be treated surgically. Minimally invasive, catheter-based, intra-arterial therapies such as TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) have become the mainstay therapy and are included in all treatment guidelines because of their ability to achieve local tumor control and extend survival. TACE overcomes the problem of chemoresistance in cancer cells by delivering high dose chemotherapy through image guidance and embolization of the tumor feeding blood vessel. TACE most commonly uses an oily medium (Lipiodol) as a radiopaque drug delivery mate- rial by creating an emulsion between drugs and oil. The recent introduction of drug-eluting bead (DEB) technol- ogy provides an opportunity to achieve the goal of controlled and sustainable drug release to tumors, which was not possible with oily TACE. Although TACE clearly improves patient survival, limitations still exist – speciﬁcally, incomplete treatment and tumor recurrence – attributed to the stimulation of angiogenesis. Most of these issues can be addressed with a greater understanding of the tumor microenvironment, in particular the relationship that exists between hypoxia, acidosis and angiogenesis. In fact, the development of imaging biomarkers reﬂecting changes within the tumor microenvironment is increasingly being pursued to individualize cancer therapies and increase their potency. Yet, our ability to characterize the tumor microenvironment using current imaging tech- nology is extremely limited. TACE has had to rely on 2D X-ray angiography until recently when the emergence of intra-procedural dual phase cone beam CT (DP-CBCT) contributed signiﬁcantly to improving tumor visualization, microcatheter guidance, and treatment endpoint. It is precisely through the longstanding close partnership be- tween Philips, Johns Hopkins and now Yale that this technology was optimized and became broadly accepted as the new standard of practice for TACE, demonstrating the prompt successful translation of research ﬁndings to clinical practice. However, the targeting of tumors and assessment of outcomes continues to be limited, relying on qualitative/semi-quantitative enhancement patterns from DP-CBCT and single parameter MR images. The unique partnership between Yale & Philips provides innovative technology that will directly enhance the role of image-guided intervention and address this unmet need by quantitatively characterizing the tumor microenvi- ronment and tumor tissue composition in order to maximize treatment potency and improve outcomes. We will integrate advanced, multiparameter MR with active CBCT imaging and create valuable biomarkers derived from novel machine learning methods for image and data analysis. By providing essential, quantitative information, drug delivery to tumors can be maximized because it will be based on inherent tumor properties. In the same way, the assessment of therapy will be much more precise and therefore useful to identify responders. Project Narrative This grant is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for liver cancer using drug delivery platforms which simultaneously embolize the tumor vasculature and locally deliver chemotherapy agents, and assess their efﬁcacy. At the core of the effort is the development, evaluation and translation to clinical practice of advanced imaging and analysis methods to characterize the tumor microen- vironment and derive feature information from novel multiparameter, multimodal images to classify tissue and quantify the response to therapy. The resulting methodology will lead to improved patient care through more precise delivery and more accurate response assessment.",Quantitative Multimodal Image Guidance for Improved Liver Cancer Treatment,9982672,R01CA206180,"['Acidity', 'Acidosis', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Angiography', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Catheters', 'Cellularity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemoembolization', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Edema', 'Emulsions', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'High Dose Chemotherapy', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Local Therapy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Necrosis', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Obesity', 'Oils', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Tweens', 'Vascularization', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'angiogenesis', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'contrast imaging', 'curative treatments', 'extracellular', 'feeding', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovative technologies', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'palliative', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'random forest', 'response', 'systemic toxicity', 'targeted delivery', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,601618,0.12995696787434421
"Multi-parametric 4-D Imaging Biomarkers for Neoadjuvant Treatment Response ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Imaging plays a critical role in evaluating tumor response to treatment; however the currently used methods remain significantly limited. For example, standards such as the RECIST are subjective and cannot be used to adequately characterize irregular lesions; tumor volume measures alone do not account for detailed structural changes; and features from selected tumor regions, such as ""hot-spot"" peak-enhancement, do not capture information from the entire tumor. As such, current approaches fall short of capturing the multi-faceted effects of treatment, including phenotypic tumor heterogeneity and its longitudinal change during treatment, which is increasingly recognized as an important predictive indicator. To date, few studies have explored using richer imaging descriptors, which could result in more powerful predictive markers. Moreover, fewer have attempted to combine multi-modal biomarkers, such as imaging with histopathologic and molecular markers, to develop enhanced predictive models for specific tumor sub-types and individual patients. We propose to develop advanced computational tools that will enable to i) extract novel multi-parametric imaging signatures and ii) accurately characterize their longitudinal patterns of change during neoadjuvant treatment via deformable image registration. Our approach is thus geared towards knowledge discovery, for determining which imaging parameters have the highest predictive value out of many possible ways to quantify information provided by imaging. In SA1 we will develop robust 4D deformable image registration methods, based on principles of mutual saliency, for estimating transformations that will enable us to robustly register serial imaging scans and obtain anatomically precise spatio-temporal parametric maps of longitudinal tissue effects induced by treatment. In SA2 we will analyze whole-tumor and normal tissue effects by performing multi- parametric feature extraction, including a rich set of morphologic, textural, kinetic and parenchymal tissue descriptors, which in conjunction to registration will allow us to comprehensively capture the dynamically evolving imaging phenotype during treatment. In SA3 we will test our method in a major breast imaging study, the I-SPY 1/ACRIN 6657 trial. We will apply machine learning tools to identify high-dimensional associations of imaging patterns, in conjunction to histopathologic tumor subtyping, that can best predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and 5-year disease free survival (DFS). In SA4 we will independently test our models with the I-SPY 2/ACRIN 6698 trial, where we will also evaluate the robustness of our features to a diverse range of treatments. Our methods hold the promise to shift the current paradigm in personalizing neoadjuvant treatment by 1) improving the current standards of imaging-based assessment and 2) introducing new imaging biomarkers that can be of higher value as early predictors of treatment response and survival.

"SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Thermal ablation systems are typically accompanied by ablation treatment planning system to optimize the treatment outcome using pre-operative CT scan. Radiomics is a process of converting medical images into higher-dimensional data and subsequent mining of data to reveal underlying pathophysiology for enhancing clinical decision support making. Radiomics analysis have shown promises in capturing distinct tumor characteristics and predicting prognosis of the tumor. We propose innovative method to calculate microwave ablation zones by supplementing a bioheat transfer model of microwave tissue ablation with microwave sensitive radiomics features, which will generate more accurate and personalized ablation prediction leading to better treatment outcome. Inputs to the bioheat transfer modeling approach include the geometry of the target tumor, physical properties of the tissue, and dimensions of the microwave ablation applicator. The radiomics algorithm extracts properties of the targeted tumor’s size and shape, as well as texture from CT images. Therefore, shape, size, and texture data computed through 3D wavelets are employed as radiomics features for more accurate dose prediction. The proposed radiomics analysis is conducted in three stages: (1)automatic detection of candidate tumors, (2)automatic segmentation of a selected tumor, (3)extraction of features from the segmented tumor, (4)analysis of ablated tumor over period of time. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402 - Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10269839,5N91020C00050,"['3-Dimensional', 'Ablation', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Characteristics', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Image', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Shapes', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Texture', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud based', 'data mining', 'feature extraction', 'innovation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'multidimensional data', 'outcome forecast', 'physical property', 'preclinical study', 'radiomics', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"PHENOMAPPER, LLC",N43,2020,398952,0.07391180126550509
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies.

"Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response ABSTRACT  Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.  Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed and objective treatment decisions.  Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.  Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In children with brain tumors impacting their vision, physicians have difficulty determining when the treatment is working. We will improve upon the very basic and often inaccurate human measurements of tumor size by developing quantitative imaging tools to make accurate and automated measures of tumor volume and shape. From these measures, we will create methods that will enable clinical trials and physicians to make informed decisions about the treatment’s success and whether the child will recover their vision.",Quantitative MRI for Pediatric Optic Pathway Glioma Treatment Response,9927849,UG3CA236536,"['3-Dimensional', '8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Brain Neoplasm', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complete Blindness', 'Data', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Incidence', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optic Chiasm', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optic Nerve Glioma', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor Volume', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data harmonization', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,UG3,2020,477374,0.04684973048775906
"Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology Project Summary  The development of targeted therapy (BRAF/MEKi) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting the co-inhibitory receptors CTLA-4 and PD-1 have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma. However, only a subset of patients maintain durable responses, and many people experience substantial side effects of therapy. Predicting therapeutic response in individual patients remains a critical and unresolved issue. Furthermore, the series of key genomic and epigenetic events driving progression and resistance to therapy is incompletely understood. The guiding hypothesis of this proposal is that (a) resistance to ICB and targeted therapy is mediated by tumor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms, some of which may be elucidated by systematic multi-modal molecular characterization of the tumor and tumor microenvironment; and (b) applying modern machine-learning and statistical approaches to molecular and clinical data from patient tumors will inform development of new therapeutic approaches and predictive models to improve patient care.  Identifying and validating predictors of intrinsic resistance to BRAF/MEKi and ICB across large human cohorts has been limited to date. Aim 1 of this proposal applies genomic and transcriptomic characterization of pre-treatment tumors to large cohorts of patients treated with BRAF/MEKi, PD-1i, and CTLA-4i in order to discover and to validate molecular and clinical markers of response and resistance. Machine learning approaches will integrate these markers into parsimonious models predicting response. A differential analysis using mutual information will be conducted to reveal markers that predict differential response to therapy.  A significant proportion of patients do not respond or maintained sustained responses to immunotherapy, and there is a critical need to characterize the acquisition or selection of drivers that confer resistance to immunotherapy. Aim 2 of this proposal develops algorithms using molecular characterization of longitudinally collected tumor samples across multiple anatomic sites to discover genomic and epigenetic drivers of progression and resistance to immunotherapy using phylogenetic analysis as the backbone of discovery.  Finally, the ability to detect novel tumor driver mutations present at low frequencies is strongly dependent on cohort size. Aim 3 of this proposal leverages all genomically characterized melanomas to perform a meta- analysis using state-of-the-art and novel algorithms to discover novel driver mutations present at low frequencies with a focus on tumor subsets that lack known targetable drivers.  These studies will expand the actionable landscape of genomic and epigenetic alterations in metastatic melanoma, advance our understanding of intrinsic and acquired resistance to targeted and immunotherapies in melanoma, and establish a framework to predict response in individual patients, which may impact patient care in melanoma and have applicability in other disease settings. Project Narrative  New targeted and immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment and extended the prognosis of metastatic melanoma, but only a subset of patients have durable responses, and our ability to predict who will benefit from which treatment is limited. Further, the specific alterations driving tumor progression and resistance to therapy are not well characterized, but may inform the development of new therapeutic targets and combination therapies. This proposal aims to integrate molecular data from patient tumor samples and their clinical context to predict response to targeted and immunotherapies, and dissect the drivers of progression and resistance to therapy in individual patients.",Dissecting Therapeutic Resistance and Progression in Metastatic Melanoma Through Clinical Computational Oncology,9997854,K08CA234458,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAF gene', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Anatomic Sites', 'Mutation', 'NF1 mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Tail', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vertebral column', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'driver mutation', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'melanoma', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'side effect', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K08,2020,250795,0.09728611002807461
"Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma Glioblastoma is the most common adult primary brain tumor and is highly aggressive in its disease course. Despite advances in neurosurgical resection, radiation targeting, and chemotherapy, the prognosis remains grim with a median survival of just 15 months. The effectiveness of current radiation therapy strategies is severely limited by shortcomings in the imaging modalities used to develop treatment plans. Current radiation therapy planning is mainly based on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, which identifies high grade tumors that are immediately associated with leaky neovasculature. Although it is an excellent diagnostic tool to identify high grade from low grade tumors, it is unable to signal occult infiltration beyond the core of the tumor. Though many believe GBM to be an incurable disease, we believe we have identified a method for optimizing tumor targeting that will increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy. A significant component of the current problem in GBM therapy is the lack of treatment for non-enhancing regions that are significantly infiltrated by neoplastic glioma cells without neovascularization. This untreated population undoubtedly leads to early recurrence. The proposed study addresses an important step toward translating an advanced quantitative imaging modality that complements the conventional imaging that is capable of reliably revealing glioma- infiltrated regions for precise, personalized treatment targeting. Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an alternative modality able to identify endogenous metabolism within tissue without the need for exogenous contrast, and has been shown to identify the metabolic abnormalities associated with tumor beyond the regions identified by T1-weighted MRI. The clinical integration of sMRI in patient management has been limited due to the computational challenges of analysis of sMRI data. Two key hurdles to be overcome are the insufficiency of filters to remove image artifacts and the necessity of quantification of metabolic levels relative to a patient's baseline metabolism. As a result, sMRI processing requires skilled user intervention and many hours of computational and user time. To automate this pipeline and provide clinically useful information to oncologists, we seek to develop a software framework for the automated and expedient processing of sMRI for use in radiation therapy planning. We will use novel advances in the fields of high performance computing and deep learning, an approach to computation that has shattered benchmarks in many medical and non-medical problems. Specifically, we will develop filters for removing artifacts, algorithms for personalized diagnosis of tumor infiltration, and explore deep learning as a method to synthesize sMRI data with anatomical and clinical metrics in a fully automated fashion. Success in the proposed work will produce a “scanner-to-clinician” platform for quantitative, expedient, and objective analysis methods to integrate sMRI into the clinical radiation therapy planning paradigm. Ultimately, we believe this additional modality in the physician's tool belt will lead to better outcomes in patients suffering from this debilitating disease. Project Narrative  Proton spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is a molecular imaging modality that can accurately detect abnormalities in the metabolic signatures of tumor cells, making it ideal for the detection and monitoring of highly infiltrative brain tumors like glioblastoma. Clinical adoption of sMRI has been slow due to limited tools for expedient and objective processing of sMRI data into information that oncologists can use for therapy planning. This proposal addresses these challenges using recent advances in high performance computing and machine learning to develop a software framework for using sMRI in the clinical management of patients with glioblastoma.",Towards the automation of MR spectroscopic imaging in patients with glioblashoma,9926827,F30CA206291,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Excision', 'Gaussian model', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Infiltration', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Neoplasms', 'Oncologist', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Framework', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'genomic data', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'learning network', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'metabolic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodal data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'neovascularization', 'neovasculature', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'software development', 'spectroscopic data', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'white matter']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.027690985025944213
"Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients Project Summary  Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and aggressive form of brain cancer affecting up to 20,000 new patients in the US every year. Standard of care therapies include stereotactic surgical resection, radiation therapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy. After initial treatment, patient monitoring is guided by standard MR imaging performed at routine intervals. Despite these rigorous therapies, current median survival is only 15 months. Imaging is a central part of brain tumor management, but MRI findings in brain tumor patients can be challenging to interpret and is further confounded by interpretation variability. Accurate interpretation of imaging is particularly important during the post-treatment phase of patient care as it can help clinicians proactively manage disease through early, precise characterization of true tumor recurrence. Disease-specific structured reporting systems attempt to reduce variability in imaging results by implementing well-defined imaging criteria and standardized language. The Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS), developed at Emory University, is one such framework streamlined for clinical workflows and includes quantitative criteria for more objective evaluation of follow-up imaging. While BT-RADS has had success with clinical adoptability, it still faces hurdles reducing interobserver variability and improving objective classification of disease state.  This proposed study addresses an unmet need for unbiased, quantitative metrics for robust, objective interpretation of follow-up imaging for GBM patients. Where previous evaluative methods used two-dimensional, representative MRI slices for evaluating the extent of tumor, we propose to develop a deep learning segmentation tool, accurately calculating volumes of tumor after surgical resection, and trained from our expansive database of patient data with contours manually drawn by radiation oncologists. Further, we propose to develop computationally advanced software for predicting disease progression building upon the clinically developed BT- RADS criteria. Such tools would assist physicians in caring for brain tumor patients through post-treatment surveillance and guide future clinical decision making. In addition, we believe these quantitative metrics would have unbounded potential in clinical trial settings where it may be difficult to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutics for GBM. Therefore, these assistive tools will be tested on clinical trial data to determine if they are superior to conventional measurements alone.  A fundamental goal of this proposal is ensuring the quantitative tools we develop are applicable for clinicians in their daily lives. Therefore, an effort will be made to collaborate extensively with clinicians to house the algorithms in sleek, intuitive software for physicians to utilize. Through the multidisciplinary environment, high performance computing, and clinical resources we have available, we believe this proposal will be successful in developing clinically assistive tools for unbiased, objective monitoring of GBM patients in clinical settings and evaluation of novel therapies in research settings. Project Narrative  Follow-up imaging for glioblastoma patients is challenging to interpret due to subjectivity in evaluating disease state and overlap between treatment effects and tumor progression. More objective follow-up criteria are vital for sensitive and accurate monitoring of glioblastoma patients after initial treatment to ensure proactive management of disease and accurate characterization of tumor recurrence. This research proposal will develop user-friendly quantitative software for lesion segmentation and disease-state assessment, providing unbiased metrics for post-treatment patient monitoring and guidance of management decisions in clinical and research settings.",Automated imaging analysis tools to guide clinical decision making in brain tumor patients,9911574,F31CA247564,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Future', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'automated image analysis', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'disease classification', 'follow-up', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'network architecture', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'user-friendly']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.0706071591232075
"Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search Project Summary When looking at an x-ray, radiologists are typically asked to localize a tumor (if present), and to classify it, judging its size, class, position and so on. Importantly, during this task, radiologists examine on a daily basis hundreds and hundreds of x-rays, seeing several images one after the other. A main underlying assumption of this task is that radiologists’ percepts and decisions on a current X-ray are completely independent of prior events. Recent results showed that this is not true: our perception and decisions are strongly biased by our past visual experience. Although serial dependencies were proposed to be a purposeful mechanism to achieve perceptual stability of our otherwise noisy visual input, serial dependencies play a crucial and deleterious role in the everyday task performed by radiologists. For example, an x-ray containing a tumor can be classified as benign depending on the content of the previously seen x-ray. Given the importance and the impact of serial dependencies in clinical tasks, in this proposal, we plan to (1) establish, (2) identify and (3) mitigate the conditions under which serial effects determine our percepts and decisions in tumor search tasks. In Aim 1, we will establish the presence of serial effects in four different clinically relevant domains: tumor detection, tumor classification, tumor position and recognition speed. In Aim 2, we plan to identify the specific boundary conditions under which visual serial dependence impacts tumor search in radiology. In Aim 3, once we will fully understand these boundary conditions in Aim 2, we will propose a series of task and stimulus manipulations to control and mitigate the deleterious effects of visual serial dependence on tumor search. As a result of these manipulations, visual search performance should improve in measurable ways (detection, classification, position, speed). Aim 3 is particularly crucial because it will allow us to propose new guidelines which will greatly improve tumor recognition in x-ray images, making this task even more effective and reliable. Taken together, the proposed studies in Aim 1, 2, and 3 will allow us to establish, identify, and mitigate the deleterious effect of serial dependencies in radiological search tasks, which could have a significant impact on the health and well-being of patients everywhere. ! ! ! Project Narrative Our proposal is designed to investigate the detrimental impact of visual serial dependencies in clinical settings. Serial dependencies significantly impact our perceptual experience, but little is known about their detrimental consequences when radiologists are asked to detect tumors in x-rays. Crucially, the final goal of our research project is to develop recommendations and guidelines to mitigate the negative effect of serial effects and, thus, improve diagnosis accuracy.",Isolating and mitigating sequentially dependent perceptual errors in clinical visual search,9917724,R01CA236793,"['Benign', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'improved', 'laboratory experiment', 'radiologist', 'tumor', 'visual search']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,312511,0.04222925028583594
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,10001323,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2020,442117,0.048698148728547296
"Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression. Our preliminary observations lead to central hypothesis that tumor size-induced hypoxia establishes a “hypoxic secretome”, which initiates the migratory phenotype; the hypoxic secretome then cooperate with intracellular signaling networks to independently maintain cell migration. We propose three independent but inter-related aims to link hypoxic secretome with the initiation, maintenance and spatial distribution of migratory phenotypes. Aim 1 will engineer size-controlled DCIS organoids (150-600 µm) with controlled hypoxic microenvironments to identify and examine how hypoxic secretome initiates migratory phenotype. We will combine experimental organoid models with time-lapse imaging and computational approaches to study organoid migration. Aim 2 will demonstrate that migratory cells can re-establish the secretome and maintain migratory phenotype independent of hypoxia. We will reconstruct an intracellular signaling network activated by the hypoxic secretome using microarray data. We will verify these gene expression signatures in sorted migratory and non-migratory cells, and validate them using secretome inhibition studies. Aim 3 will investigate, for the first time, the spatial distribution and origin of the migratory phenotype. We will use CRISPR-based gene knock-in (FP-labeling), automated image analyses, and a deep-learning algorithm to track and visualize the emergence of migratory phenotypes from the hypoxic core outward to the periphery or from the migratory front. The successful development of this 3D organoid model and completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment. It is straightforward to generalize our system to other tumor types, development of tumor/stromal co-culture, and drug screening. Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second most common cause of death in women. Lack of mechanistic understanding on how a breast cancer in situ develops into malignant invasive breast cancer contributes to growing problem of both overtreatment and undertreatment. To address this, we propose to develop three-dimensional organoid model using cell lines and primary patient-derived cells. Based on existing studies and our own preliminary studies, we hypothesize that organoid size-induced hypoxia and secretome factors work cooperatively to initiate and maintain the migratory phenotype. We will use integrated bioengineering, computational and imaging approaches to test this hypothesis and discover novel druggable targets to stop emergence of migratory phenotype.",Three-dimensional organoid models to study breast cancer progression,9968180,R37CA232209,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'E-Cadherin', 'Engineering', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Experimental Models', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-in', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammography', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Stromal Neoplasm', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vimentin', 'Woman', 'Work', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'breast cancer progression', 'cell motility', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'genetic signature', 'genomic profiles', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'infiltrating duct carcinoma', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'paracrine', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2020,449186,-0.030958298373840353
"Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology Accurate intraoperative tissue diagnosis is central to medical decision making during brain tumor surgery. Existing intraoperative histologic techniques deplete scant tissue biopsies, introduce freezing artifacts, and rely on highly- skilled technicians and neuropathologists working in dedicated surgical pathology laboratories to produce and interpret slides. In addition, the number of centers where brain tumor surgery is performed far exceeds the number of board-certified neuropathologists, eliminating the possibility for expert consultation in many cases. Even in the most advanced, well-staffed hospitals, turnaround time for intraoperative pathology poses a major barrier for the efficient delivery of surgical care, highlighting the need for an improved system for rapid diagnosis. Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) creates high-resolution digital microscopic images of unprocessed tissue specimens in a fraction of the time of conventional techniques and eliminates reliance on a frozen section laboratory for sectioning, staining, mounting and reviewing slides. While SRH has been shown to reveal key diagnostic histologic features in brain tumor specimens, major technical hurdles related to laser safety and performance have hindered its clinical translation. The existing academic-industrial partnership between established collaborators has resulted in the development and initial validation of a clinically-compatible SRH microscope in a patient care setting (Nature Biomedical Engineering 1:0027, 2017). We have demonstrated that SRH has diagnostic value comparable to conventional histologic techniques and that SRH images are well-suited for interpretation via an automated machine learning algorithm. The proposed research program represents a multi-disciplinary (neurosurgery, neuropathology, biostatistics, computer science and medical device manufacturing) academic-industry partnership to accelerate the development of an SRH imager for use during brain tumor surgery. The overall goal of the partnership is to create pathways for online collaboration between surgeons and pathologists using the SRH imager, provide strong evidence for the utility of SRH in the setting of a prospective randomized controlled trial and to enhance our capabilities for automated intraoperative diagnosis employing state-of the-art image classification methods including convolutional neural networks. Once completed, this research program will improve the care of brain tumor patients by streamlining the process for intraoperative diagnosis. It will also create a pathway for remote and automated diagnosis, extending expertise in neuropathology to more centers caring for brain tumor patients. SRH technology combined with algorithms for automated intraoperative diagnosis create the possibility of advancing the larger field of surgical oncology where histologic information is essential for making surgical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Existing techniques for creating histologic images of tissue during surgery are time-consuming, prone to error, may complicate diagnosis and surgical-decision making. We have developed an optical imaging technology which streamlines tissue diagnosis during surgery, enabling a uniform workflow that will improve the care of cancer patients. Through this academic-industrial partnership of successful collaborators, we aim to accumulate data which will propel this emerging technology towards becoming the new standard of care for intraoperative histology.",Clinical Translation of Stimulated Raman Histology,9987579,R01CA226527,"['American', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Histologic', 'Histological Techniques', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical translation', 'college', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'data centers', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'graphical user interface', 'histological image', 'imager', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuropathology', 'neurosurgery', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prospective', 'rapid diagnosis', 'standard of care', 'virtual']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,525328,0.05620193743984146
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,0.08082187872207144
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,9833512,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,258394,0.01787207642927943
"Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy Project Summary/Abstract The blockade of inhibitory immune checkpoints has transformed the treatment of cancer for patients across a broad range of malignancies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is achieved by administering antibodies that block the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway to reinvigorate antitumor T cell activity. Despite treatment responses that are unprecedented and durable, the majority of patients do not experience a clinical benefit from treatment, and some responders relapse and acquire resistance. Moreover, response patterns of tumors treated with ICB are unconventional, and can be misinterpreted as disease progression by radiographic imaging. To maximize the precision and benefit of ICB therapy, identification of predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers to objectively assess immune responses has rapidly emerged as a clinical priority. The proposal aims to leverage protease activity as predictive biomarkers for monitoring ICB response and resistance. Proteases play a central role in the underlying biology of immunity, oncology, and anti-tumor responses. The mark of a “hot” tumor is signified by an effective immune infiltrate of cytotoxic T cells that lyse cancer cells via the classical perforin- and granzyme-mediated pathway – the latter of which comprise a family of potent serine proteases. Tumor expression of proteases, including inflammatory and matrix degrading proteases, is well-established as a hallmark of fundamental tumor processes including angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis. The central hypothesis is that quantifying the activity of T cell and tumor proteases early-on-treatment will allow identification of activity biomarkers that predict treatment efficacy and indicate resistance to ICB therapy. To achieve these goals, this proposal aims to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade antibodies that are endowed with the dual capacity to inhibit immune checkpoints and sense protease activity during treatment responses. These activity sensing ICB diagnostics, or IDB-Dx, comprise -PD-1 or -CTLA-4 antibodies that are site-specifically functionalized with a library of mass-barcoded peptide substrates. During responses to ICB, these peptides are cleaved by T cell and tumor proteases that are elevated in “hot” tumors, liberating a unique fingerprint of mass barcodes that are then filtered into the recipient’s urine for quantification by mass spectrometry. By applying machine learning algorithms, these signatures of protease activity are trained and validated as predictive classifiers to discriminate “hot” and “cold” tumors, responders from non-responders, and resistance to therapy. Project Narrative Cancer immunotherapy using immune checkpoint blockade is transforming the treatment of cancer patients. Although some patients experience durable responses, new methods are required to identify patient responders, evaluate unconventional immune responses, and detect immune resistance. We propose to develop a new class of checkpoint blockade therapies that harness protease activity for predictive monitoring of treatment response and resistance.",Harnessing protease activity for predictive monitoring of cancer immunotherapy,9897497,R01CA237210,"['Antibodies', 'Antitumor Response', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Fingerprint', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granzyme', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Inflammatory', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Peptidyltransferase', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Recombinants', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serine Protease', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Traction', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transcript', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urinalysis', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'humanized mouse', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune resistance', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'perforin', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'pharmacodynamic biomarker', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'resistance mechanism', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'sortase', 'success', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,340630,0.07326724502317429
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9981696,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic testing', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2020,742092,0.10123070384153583
"Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma ABSTRACT  Glioblastoma (GBM) exhibits profound intratumoral molecular heterogeneity that contributes to treatment resistance and poor survival. Specifically, each tumor comprises multiple molecularly-distinct subpopulations with different treatment sensitivities. This heterogeneity not only portends the pre-existence of resistant molecular subpopulations, but also the communications between neighboring subpopulations that further modulate tumorigenicity and resistance. In fact, a minority tumor subpopulation with EGFRvIII mutation has been shown to potentiate a majority subpopulation with wild-type EGFR to increase tumor growth, cell survival, and drug resistance. This type of cooperativity presents clear implications for improving GBM treatment. Yet compared to other tumor types, the interactions in GBM remain critically understudied. A significant barrier to studying the interactions between molecularly-distinct subpopulations is the challenge of tissue sampling in GBM. In particular, contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) routinely guides surgical biopsy and resection of the MRI enhancing core, but fails to address the diverse subpopulations of the surrounding non-enhancing parenchyma (so called “brain around tumor” or BAT). These unresected residual subpopulations in BAT represent the main contributors to tumor recurrence, which can exhibit different therapeutic targets (and interactions) compared with enhancing biopsies. To address the limitations of tissue sampling, imaging techniques can help quantitatively characterize tumors in their entirety, including unresected BAT regions. Our group has used multi-parametric MRI and image-guided biopsies to develop and validate machine-learning (ML) models of intratumoral genomic heterogeneity, with particular focus on the BAT zone. In Aim 1, will we collect and molecularly profile a large set of image-recorded stereotactic biopsies in primary GBM patients to quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations, as well as their phenotypic niches, throughout the BAT zone. We will assess local heterogeneity at the biopsy level and also co-localize regional patterns and rates of recurrence on serial MRI. In Aim 2, we will use these biopsies and spatially matched MRI metrics to refine our existing ML predictive models. We will use these ML models to co- localize spatial patterns of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their phenotypic niches) to quantify their risk of regional recurrence. In Aim 3, we will functionally validate the subpopulation interactions observed in Aims 1 and 2 using patient derived xenograft (PDX) models. We will also validate these interactions in human GBM using a subset of spatially matched biopsies from primary and recurrent tumors in the same patients. This proposal leverages our unique expertise in image-guided tissue analysis and MRI-based computational modeling to study the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations and the evolving competitive landscapes in human GBM. This work will help risk stratify patients in future targeted clinical drug trials and should also facilitate new strategies (e.g., adaptive therapy) to exploit subpopulation co-dependency for therapeutic benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose here a novel strategy that identifies the potential molecular underpinnings of treatment resistance within the zone where tumor almost always recurs. By developing image-based models that quantify the diversity of molecularly-distinct subpopulations (and their interactions) within individual tumors, the proposed work will improve image-based diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in the paradigm of individualized oncology.",Quantifying Multiscale Competitive Landscapes of Clonal Diversity in Glioblastoma,10005896,U01CA220378,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Tumorigenicity', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'epidermal growth factor receptor VIII', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image guided', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mathematical model', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'serial imaging', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'translational impact', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ARIZONA,U01,2020,952700,0.10394027296524942

"Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment Project Summary/Abstract Current cancer therapies provide targeted treatments attacking specific cells, however, tumor cells are heterogeneous and evolving. To develop personalized treatments, we need to understand the composition of cell types in the tumor and the disrupted regulatory mechanisms that lead to cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs are resistant to standard therapies and have the ability to form new tumors leading to relapse and metastasis. Immunotherapies harnessing the immune system can be particularly successful in targeting CSCs, however, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. I hypothesize that an unbiased study of the complex tumor microenvironment containing elusive resistant CSCs and interacting immune populations can be achieved with high-dimensional genome-wide data, such as state-of-the-art single-cell resolution transcriptional integrated with epigenetic measurements, using Bayesian statistical tools that are ideal for distinguishing technical noise from biological heterogeneity and integrating different data types. I capitalize on our previous work in collaboration with the Alexander Rudensky Lab on characterizing immune cell populations in breast cancer tumors, using a computational method we developed in the Dana Pe’er Lab for clustering cells in single-cell transcriptomic data while simultaneously normalizing cells and correcting batch effects. In my PhD work, I showed the power of incorporating epigenetic data in inferring regulatory programs. Hence, in my K99 mentored phase, I aim to develop a computational framework for integrating epigenetic data with single-cell transcriptomic data to infer leukemic stem cells and dysregulated mechanisms in Acute Myeloid Leukemia in collaboration with Ross Levine (Aim 1). I have chosen AML as it involves enrichment of epigenetic mutations and the normal hematopoiesis system is well-characterized and would serve as a reference. As an independent investigator in the R00 phase, I will extend this framework to infer CSCs and dysregulations in the tumor as well as composition of immune cells and their reprogramming in under-characterized solid tumors, in collaboration with Benjamin Neel and others in my future institute (Aim 2). I then aim to use this toolbox to study the impact of immunotherapy treatments on the tumor-immune microenvironment in collaboration with Catherine Wu and my future institute (Aim 3). We expect that our results lead to insights into regulatory mechanisms that are disrupted in cancer and drive heterogeneous populations. We would also infer mechanisms of action of immunotherapies in the tumor-immune microenvironment. This proposal describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator at the interface of machine learning and cancer biology. During the K99 phase, I will be supported by an outstanding and interdisciplinary team of advisors and collaborators with expertise in all aspects of the proposed research. Together with institutional support from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and formal coursework and training, I will bridge my knowledge gap in cancer biology and gain the communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. Project Narrative  Cancer treatments lead to favorable outcomes only in a subset of patients due to significant heterogeneity in tumor cells. To develop treatments tailored to each patient and the composition of cell types in each tumor, we need to characterize the complex populations of tumor cells and their dysregulated mechanisms. I propose that an unbiased characterization can be achieved with an interdisciplinary framework of single-cell resolution transcriptional and epigenetic measurements, that are integrated with principled computational tools.",Integrative framework for identifying dysregulated mechanisms in the tumor-immune microenvironment,10102369,R00CA230195,"['ATAC-seq', 'Accounting', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Donor Lymphocyte Infusion', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunotherapy', 'Impairment', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Measurement', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'genome-wide', 'heuristics', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'interest', 'leukemic stem cell', 'longitudinal analysis', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mutant', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'single cell analysis', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'stem cell population', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R00,2020,249000,0.06395446322638801
"The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration ABSTRACT: Accurate segmentation of solid tumors is challenging, due to their heterogeneous shape, extent, and location, as well as their appearance variation caused by the diversity of medical imaging. Manual annotation is tedious, prone to misinterpretation, human error, and observer bias. All these factors hinder further image analysis towards understanding tumor radio-phenotypes, predicting clinical outcomes, and monitoring progression patterns. Computational competitions have been seeking optimal advanced computational segmentation algorithms (ACSAs) for specific abnormalities, by pooling multi-institutional data together and benchmarking ACSAs from international groups. Along these lines, we have been successfully leading the organization of the International Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge, since 2012, towards a publicly-available pooled dataset of 542 multi-parametric MRI scans of glioma patients from 19 institutions. In the summarized analysis of all BraTS results, we have shown that although individual ACSAs do not outperform the gold standard agreement across expert clinicians, their fusion does outperform it, in terms of both accuracy and consistency across subjects. Towards the wider application of these ACSAs, in 2017 we created the BraTS algorithmic repository to make available Docker containers of individual ACSAs, created by BraTS participants. However, fusion of these ACSAs is still out of reach for clinical researchers, as there is no graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate it, and execution of such algorithms requires substantial computational background by the user. Furthermore, although competitions such as BraTS have shown promise, they cannot easily scale due to the requirement of pooling patient data from multiple institutions to a single location, that often faces legal, privacy, and data-ownership concerns. These concerns motivate distributed learning solutions, where the data are always retained within their institutions. We have been investigating such solutions to avoid the current paradigm of multi-institutional collaboration, i.e., data-sharing, and considering their potential multi-institutional adoption, with respect to privacy, scalability, and performance, we found federated learning (FL) to be most appropriate. In FL, each institution trains a model and shares it (without patient data) with an aggregation server, which then integrates institutional models in parallel and distributes back a consensus model. In this proposal, we focus on developing the open- source Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, which with a user-friendly GUI will aim at i) bringing pre- trained models of various ACSAs and their fusion closer to clinical experts, and ii) allowing secure multi- institutional collaborations via FL to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges. Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. NARRATIVE: Successful completion of this project will lead to a clinically translatable, easy-to-use software tool that offers a) pre-trained tumor segmentation models and their fusion, to perform better than experts, and b) a federated learning framework facilitating secure multi-institutional collaborations to improve these pre-trained models without the need to share patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges, towards accelerating research of cancer radio-phenotypes.",The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform: An intuitive tool facilitating secure multi-institutional collaboration,10009302,U01CA242871,"['Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Docking', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Observer Variation', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privacy', 'Radio', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Secure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bone', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'contrast enhanced', 'graphical user interface', 'human error', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'light weight', 'open source', 'predict clinical outcome', 'repository', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U01,2020,360393,0.07623649212740481

"The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC SUMMARY Exciting clinical breakthroughs with checkpoint blockade antibodies and adoptive T cell transfers have transformed the field of cancer immunotherapy, demonstrating the power of harnessing the immune system to eliminate cancer cells. However, fundamental challenges and questions remain. Significant clinical responses have only been observed in a subset of patients and cancer types, and it is currently not known what biological properties of tumors determine clinical responses, nor what strategies to adopt in clinical contexts where current immunotherapies are ineffective. To ultimately address these clinical challenges and to design predictably effective cancer treatments, we must deepen our fundamental understanding of interactions between tumors and the immune system at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC will bring the tools of systems biology to investigate cancer-immune system interactions at multiple stages of disease progression to answer central questions in cancer immunology and inform the design of novel immunotherapeutic interventions. We have organized our Research Center around three central scientific projects that examine cancer-immune interactions at distinct stages of disease progression: cancer initiation and early tumorigenesis (Project I); established and progressing tumors (Project II); latent disease and metastasis in (Project III). In Project I, we will combine new epigenomics technologies and innovative single-cell analyses with state-of-the-art systems biology approaches to decipher the underlying molecular and epigenetic programs of dysfunctional tumor- specific T cell differentiation in early tumorigenesis. We will further elucidate how dynamics in the mutational tumor antigen landscape and stromal and immune cell populations determine such states and model and test in mouse and human tumors how distinct T cell states determine sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. In Project II, we will use quantitative analysis of cell types and cell states by functional, flow cytometric, population RNA-seq and droplet RNA sequencing together with ecological models of cancer, immune, and stromal cell populations to study the response of the tumor ecosystem to immunotherapeutic perturbations in established tumors. In Project III, we will examine the evolutionary dynamics of innate immune system control of metastatic disease, a new area of investigation in cancer immunology. We will investigate the heterogeneity of latent cancer cells in their capacity for immune evasion, and we will use quantitative methods, including live cell imaging, to model latent tumor cell evasion of innate immune control and the dynamics of cycles of latent cell proliferation and potential editing by NK cells. A Shared Resource Core will provide state-of-the-art single-cell droplet sequencing technology and computational analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA- seq). This Shared Resource Core will be tasked with droplet sequencing technology development and design of novel algorithmic approaches and will interact with all three scientific Projects. Our Research Center will also carry out an innovative program of outreach and training activities at the local, national, and global levels to disseminate research findings in cancer systems immunology and to train young scientists in this emerging field. NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies are designed to harness the human immune system to attack cancer cells and eliminate tumors. Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, such as checkpoint blockade agents, have generated great excitement, but in fact only a fraction of patients and tumor types respond to these new treatments. Our proposed Research Center will deploy tools from systems biology to study tumor-immune system interactions at multiple stages to disease progression at the molecular, cellular, and systems levels, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategies.",The CSBC Research Center for Cancer Systems Immunology at MSKCC,9980798,U54CA209975,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immune system', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Stromal Cells', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapeutics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'design', 'droplet sequencing', 'epigenomics', 'graduate student', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunotherapy trials', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lectures', 'live cell imaging', 'machine learning method', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outreach program', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'tumorigenesis', 'undergraduate student']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U54,2020,2312460,0.017866551242626733
"Advanced preoperative assessment of meningiomas PROJECT SUMMARY Meningiomas, which arise from arachnoid cells, make up >1/3 of all intracranial tumors. While typically benign, these tumors induce clinical symptoms due to mass effect and peritumoral edema. In cases requiring intervention, gross total resection provides the best outcomes when possible. However, treatment strategy is ultimately decided by determining the proper balance between surgical difficulty and the patient's overall health. Two mechanical properties are important predictors of surgical difficulty: tumor stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Knowledge of these properties before surgery would allow clinicians to more accurately assess surgical risk and identify the most effective treatment strategy. Mechanical properties are difficult to predict by conventional imaging approaches, but can be directly assessed by Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) and related Slip Interface Imaging (SII). In published studies, we have shown that MRE-based stiffness estimates are significantly correlated with tumor stiffness in meningiomas and pituitary adenomas. Furthermore, SII accurately predicted tumor adherence in meningiomas and vestibular schwannomas. Still, challenges remain to make these findings clinically-impactful. For estimating stiffness, the primary limitation lies in resolution. Therefore, in Aim 1 we will develop a voxel- wise classifier of tumor stiffness. This aim will build on our recently published neural network-based inversion (NNI), which has demonstrated superior performance to conventional direct inversions in simulation and in the brain. In Aim 1a, we will advance NNI by implementing more complex neural network architectures and creating more realistic simulations for training. In Aim 1b, the advances will be validated in a phantom with inhomogeneous stiffness. Finally, in Aim 1c with the aid of our Neurosurgery collaborators, we will collect a large sample of surgical stiffness assessments. We will use these assessments to train a voxel-wise stiffness classifier, which will then be validated in a separate test set. This aim will result in a map that conveys both stiffness and confidence in the prediction on a scale that is clinically meaningful to surgeons. The most-pressing limitations in SII include the subjective interpretation of the images and the lack of spatially resolved predictions. Aim 2 will address these challenges by developing a voxel-wise slip interface classifier. In Aim 2a, we will investigate a neural network-based predictor of slip interfaces to add to our current methods. In Aim 2b, we will evaluate if this new method can improve predictions in phantom experiments. In Aim 2c, we will again leverage surgical assessments of meningioma adherence to train and test a voxel-wise classifier. The result of this aim will be a map of tumor adherence represented as an easily interpreted probability. Taken together, these aims will provide neurosurgeons with clinically-important information to improve patient management. More broadly, technical advances made in this project will impact the entire MRE field.

"Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors Summary The critical role of the innate immune system in priming CD8+ T cells to generate tumor specific responses underscores a potentially important clinical strategy for the development of next-generation immunotherapies. In this proposal, we pursue the hypothesis that small molecules identified in a high throughput screen for innate immune agonists can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of the oncolytic NDV (NewCastle Disease Virus) through activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs), and enhancement of anticancer immune responses. To address this, we propose specific aims that focus on hit validation through both ex vivo and in vivo characterization of compounds and assessing the in vivo efficacy in a B16-F10 mouse melanoma model. First, utilizing orthogonal assays, we will validate the immunopotentiation properties of compounds in ex vivo human primary monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC). Specifically, we propose to assess compound effects on MDDC activation and maturation through examination of transcriptional profiles, expression of DC activation markers, and cytokines being secreted upon compound treatment. Validated hits will then be clustered based on their activities, and the most potent compounds from each cluster will be carried forward to anti-tumor efficacy testing in a mouse melanoma model. Compounds will be added either alone or together with intratumoral injection of oncolytic NDV. Compound that synergize and enhance the anti-tumor activity of NDV, provide durable protection, and abscopal activity will be prioritized for subsequent early lead optimization.  Based on data generated from these hit validation approaches, we propose to delineate ex vivo immune signatures that can be used as surrogates for in vivo efficacy. The immune signatures elicited by selected hits within both MDDCs (ex vivo) and the tumor microenvironment (TME - in vivo) will be integrated to construct a computational model to assess correlative signatures that are able to link MDDC molecular and phenotypic responses to in vivo efficacy. Similar analysis will be conducted on immune activation readouts in the TME. This will be a reiterative process, with information obtained from the experimental studies will be utilized to refine predictions of ex vivo and in vivo biomarkers that correlate with efficacy. The information gained from this proposed study upon completion will significantly facilitate further hit-to-lead and lead optimization activities during subsequent phases of the drug development process. Narrative Newcastle Disease virus (NDV) is a promising viral agent for cancer therapy, due to its ability to induce Type-I IFNs, activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and lymphocyte infiltration into the tumor microenvironment, and induce systemic cytotoxic T cell immune responses. Using a high throughput screening approach, we have identified small molecule immunopotentiators of dendritic cell activation, and found that they harbor potent synergistic activities with oncolytic NDV in a mouse tumor model. The proposed study has a strong potential of generating T cell responses against tumor-specific antigens expressed by a patient’s individual cancer, potentially offering a novel immunotherapeutic approach to treat cancer.",Early development of small molecule dendritic cell immunopotentiators for the treatment of solid tumors,9936120,R01CA229818,"['Abscopal effect', 'Address', 'Agonist', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Dendritic cell activation', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Adjuvants', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Injections', 'Innate Immune System', 'Interferons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Newcastle disease virus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stimulator of Interferon Genes', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Activation', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'analog', 'anti-cancer', 'anticancer activity', 'antitumor agent', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical development', 'cytokine', 'drug development', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'high throughput screening', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'molecular phenotype', 'monocyte', 'next generation', 'novel', 'response', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SANFORD BURNHAM PREBYS MEDICAL DISCOVERY INSTITUTE,R01,2020,714132,0.05945875618500328
"Single-cell characterization of tumor and microenvironment co-evolution in Peripheral T-cell Lymphomas Project Summary Tumor and microenvironment constitute complex ecologies involving a multitude of stromal cells, immune cells, and in some cases coexisting microbes. A paradigmatic example of complex tumor-microenvironment interactions are peripheral T-cell lymphomas, aggressive and genetically complex tumors where tumor cells often constitute a minority cell population. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas are frequently associated with the presence of Epstein-Barr virus whose role in the disease remains largely uncharacterized. We have shown that the presence of specific macrophage populations and viral transcriptional programs are associated to survival. But, how do tumor and microenvironment coevolve and inform prognosis? Our project goal is to characterize the tumor- microenvironment interactions and coevolution in peripheral T-cell lymphomas using large collections of human transcriptomic data and longitudinal single-cell sequencing data from recently developed mouse models. We will develop an approach based on random matrix theory and topological data analysis for modelling the continuous aspect of tumor microenvironment evolution. We will further deploy our lab-developed methodology for in silico pathogen detection to study the interactions between the Epstein-Barr virus and peripheral T-cell lymphoma lymphomagenesis and progression. Successful completion of our goals will provide a general, experimentally validated strategy to uncover the dynamical nature of tumor-microenvironment interactions at the single-cell resolution in tumor types with complex stromal component. Additionally, our approach will help uncover new microenvironment driven targets supporting lymphoma cell growth, with potential therapeutic implications for the treatment of this deadly disease. Narrative Tumor and microenvironment coexist and coevolve determining clinical outcomes.

"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10126595,K08DE029241,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'CDKN2A gene', 'CUL3 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Faculty', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotensin Receptors', 'North Carolina', 'Otolaryngology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Carcinoma', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiosensitization', 'Reading Frames', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Surgeon', 'TP53 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transactivation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral HPV-positive head and neck cancers', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'prohormone', 'proneurotensin', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational genomics', 'treatment risk', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K08,2020,173993,0.02192058915835423
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9951006,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncotype', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,598709,-0.01167147212808323
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,488621,0.028796323485876362
"A Statistical Physics Framework for Understanding the Role of Repeat RNA in Tumor Immunity PROJECT SUMMARY Transcriptional dysregulation in tumors can induce the abundant expression of repetitive elements in cancerous cells compared to normal tissues, where they are often transcriptionally silent. Such transcripts have been associated with better outcomes to cancer immunotherapies, as they can modulate the tumor immune microenvironment and generate an under-quantified source of tumor neoantigens. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA is both a critical mechanism for initiating the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets. Using a set of approaches from statistical physics, our team predicted repetitive element RNA directly stimulates receptors of the innate immune system, confirmed this hypothesis in a key subset of immune cells, and showed repeat expression can correlate with response to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies. Repeat RNA is therefore both a novel biomarker for the innate immune response in cancer and a potential therapeutic target to modulate tumor immunity. We will utilize a set of tools, developed by our team, from statistical physics to characterize repeat RNA recognition by innate immune receptors in silico and their role in tumor-immune co-evolution, both with and without the application of immunotherapy (Aim 1). Next, we will characterize the spatial context of repeat RNAs in the tumor immune microenvironment and the co-localization of predicted immunostimulatory RNA with activation of immune signaling, along with in depth immune-phenotyping of the state of the immune microenvironment in vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will perform functional validation of our predictions on human immune cells to validate mechanisms of recognition and the specific immune subsets responsible for repeat recognition via a set of in vitro assays (Aim 3). Our goal is to use approaches from statistical physics to quantify the role of repetitive elements in tumor immunology, their rules of recognition by innate immune receptors and their part in facilitating cytolytic T cell activity. In doing so we will combine novel RNA detection technologies to study their spatial distribution and localization in cancers; state of the art immune-phenotyping; and mathematical models to characterize their direct role in tumor evolution. We hypothesize that our approach from statistical physics will identify the key structural and sequence features of repeat mediated immune activation in solid tumors and shed light on their specific consequences for tumor evolution and therapeutic efficacy. PROJECT NARRATIVE An emerging paradigm in cancer immunology states that the aberrant transcription of repeat RNA in cancer is a critical mechanism for engaging tumor intrinsic and extrinsic immune and regulatory factors, and an untapped source of potential therapeutic targets.

"Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The immune system has pivotal influence in the evolution and progression of many tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the presence of a strong T cell response in CRC, indicating activation of the adaptive immune system, has been associated with better patient outcomes. As such, recently developed immunotherapeutic approaches often attempt to harness the adaptive immune response. Immune cells are an integral component of the tumor microenvironment, and dynamically interact with neoplastic cells. However, our understanding as to the complexity of the T cell response and the factors that drive this response remains limited. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic, lifestyle, and tumor factors associated with the T cell response in CRC, and to characterize the survival implications of that response. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will examine the relationship of personal characteristics with T cell response in CRC, including the role of (1a) germline genetic variation within human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) genes, and (1b) lifestyle factors (e.g., aspirin use, smoking, alcohol consumption). In Aim 2 we will focus on several colorectal tumor characteristics as they relate to T cell response, including (2a) the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum and bacterial toxin genes in CRC, and (2b) somatic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., WNT signaling and RAS/RAF). In Aim 3, we will evaluate the associations of different aspects of T cell response with CRC survival, accounting for known prognostic factors and the relationships identified in Aims 1-2. To achieve these Aims, we propose to assess the density and spatial distribution of specific T cell subsets using multiplexed immunofluorescence (mIF) to quantify expression levels and co-expression patterns of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, and FOXP3 at the single cell level. This multiplexed assessment will allow us to examine the epidemiologic and prognostic relevance of numerous metrics of T cell response in CRC. This research will leverage the resources of the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). GECCO-CCFR is a large collaborative effort between observational studies of CRC. We have completed genome-wide germline genotyping and have harmonized epidemiologic data regarding a variety of lifestyle factors and personal characteristics for all participating studies. We are conducting DNA sequencing with a panel of 205 human genes and a small number of bacterial genes in CRC tumor tissue. Prospective follow-up for survival is ongoing, and we have harmonized existing survival data. Through this project, we will add information on T cell response in CRC for >2,500 CRC cases to the GECCO-CCFR resource. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the epidemiology of the T cell response in CRC and the relationship of that response with personal and tumor characteristics. Insights gained through this novel study could ultimately inform the development and targeted implementation of emerging immunotherapeutic and immunopreventative strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE In this large, collaborative effort, we will examine how germline genetics, lifestyle factors, and tumor characteristics relate to the profile of T cells in colorectal cancers, and how those T cell profiles relate to cancer survival. The results of this work may ultimately inform strategies to harness the immune system for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.",Interdisciplinary Epidemiologic Consortium to Investigate T-cell Response in Colorectal Cancer,9947639,R01CA248857,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Aspirin', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteroides fragilis toxin', 'CD3 Antigens', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Epidemiology', 'Evolution', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Fusobacterium nucleatum', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'HLA Antigens', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Killer Cells', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mutate', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteins', 'Ras/Raf', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signaling Protein', 'Smoking', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spatial Distribution', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'Work', 'adaptive immune response', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer survival', 'cell mediated immune response', 'cell type', 'colon cancer family registry', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'combinatorial', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'homeobox protein PITX1', 'immune function', 'insight', 'lifestyle factors', 'macrophage', 'microbial', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'survival outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,768324,0.020726468151312114
"Deciphering the System-Wide Immune Response to Head and Neck Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of 57%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, resulting in dramatic anti-tumor responses in some HNSCC patients; however, only about 20% show any survival benefit, and of these it is not clear what predicts response. ICIs have been thought to work primarily through reactivation of exhausted cytotoxic CD8+ T cells (CD8s) residing within the tumor microenvironment of solid tumors. Recent work, however, indicates that various CD4+ T cell populations outside the tumor microenvironment (peripheral immune system) likely play critical roles in carrying out anti-tumor immune responses. Given increasing evidence that immune cells other than CD8s are important for anti-tumor immunity, it is critical to identify and characterize these cells in order to understand their roles during HNSCC tumorigenesis and ICI therapy, which are currently unknown. This proposal by Dr. Kyle Jones, DDS, PhD seeks to significantly advance our understanding of cancer immunology in the context of HNSCC tumors, with the ultimate goal of improving existing ICI therapies and developing new treatment strategies. With the assistance of a multi-disciplinary mentoring team, he will use a novel systems biology approach to accomplish the following Aims: (AIM 1) Quantify the effects that HNSCC tumors have on systemic immunity and determine if these changes are conserved across tumor, blood, and regional lymph nodes; (AIM 2) Determine how the ICI atezolizumab alters the intratumoral and peripheral immune states of HNSCC patients and if these changes are associated with tumor response to therapy. These Aims will define how HNSCC tumors alter the composition and function of patients' immune systems at single cell and systems levels as well as identify/characterize the specific immune cells that contribute to anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones will use high throughput single-cell methods such as mass cytometry, multiplexed ion beam imaging, and single-cell RNAseq along with established analytic pipelines on HNSCC patient specimens obtained before and after ICI therapy. The innovation of this approach, which permits simultaneous study of all immune cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, will reveal how changes in any individual immune cell population affects the overall immune state. It will also be important for the discovery of additional immune cell populations and biomarkers associated with HNSCC anti-tumor immunity following ICI therapy. Dr. Jones's long-term career goal is to become an expert, leader, and independent translational scientist in the fields of head and neck cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Through this K23 award, he will obtain the additional training in experimental immunology, single cell analysis methods, computer programming, advanced statistical methods, and career development he needs to successfully achieve this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide and affects up to 45,000 people annually within the United States, with a 5-year survival rate of only 57%.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9980817,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,374477,0.03924800378279503
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9842277,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,413430,0.028189033623715772
"Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy ABSTRACT Recent advances in checkpoint blockade immunotherapy (CBI) inhibiting programmed death-1 (PD-1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) have revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the limited response rates in most cancers suggest that new approaches and targets are clearly needed to fully elucidate the underlying biology of dysfunctional and exhausted CD8 T cells in cancer and achieve durable responses (cure). G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most intensively studied drug targets since they play key roles in many physiological processes, and they have remained longstanding favorable pharmacological targets. Here, we plan to first use novel computational approaches analyzing multiple single cell RNAseq databases to deconvolute T cell heterogeneity in order to generate a transcriptomic GPCR signature for tumor infiltrating T cells. Preliminary data shows an upregulation of prostaglandin receptors, EP2 and EP4, on exhausted T cells, suggesting that these GPCRs that are coupled to the G protein Gs, and their downstream signaling cascades may be dampening anti-tumor cytotoxicity of CD8 T cells, leading to exhaustion. We hypothesize that activation of EP2 and EP4 on CD8 T cells and the subsequent Gs signaling leads to decreased cytotoxic and migratory activity that nullifies the effectiveness of PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade. Put together, EP2 and EP4 may represent promising candidates as immune checkpoints that can be targeted in combination with CBI as part of novel multimodality precision immunotherapy approach to reactivate the immune system to destroy tumors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have led to major treatment breakthroughs for a number of different cancers, but the majority of the cancer patients do not respond to immunotherapies, and clinical responses are often not durable. The research outlined in this proposal will illuminate the roles of G protein coupled receptors on immune cells in cancer that may lead to the identification of novel targets that need to be blocked in combination with current immunotherapies to achieve complete responses (cure).",Targeting the Immune Onco-GPCRome  as a Novel Multimodal Cancer Immunotherapy Strategy,9992888,F31CA250488,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigens', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bypass', 'CD28 gene', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CTLA4 gene', 'CXCR3 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dinoprostone', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Functional disorder', 'G Protein-Coupled Receptor Signaling', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'G-substrate', 'GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Genes', 'Graph', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'In complete remission', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Production', 'Prostaglandin Receptor', 'Receptor Activation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'T cell response', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Up-Regulation', 'Virus Diseases', 'WFDC2 gene', 'anti-tumor immune response', 'antitumor effect', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell motility', 'chemokine receptor', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxic', 'cytotoxicity', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'expression vector', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'migration', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'receptor', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F31,2020,38401,0.005323403213662344
