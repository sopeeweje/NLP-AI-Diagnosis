"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9675213,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'airway obstruction', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'decision tree learning', 'epidemiologic data', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,665560,0.19600498611730321
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,9886424,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,179997,-0.020463070576564553
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9762973,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,3319382,0.10276695949406706
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9755494,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2019,50016,0.15091254931918527
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability Project Summary/Abstract The application's broad, long-term objective is to develop, evaluate and commercialize a device for continuous monitoring of a child's asthma components (symptoms, lung function variability, nighttime awakenings, etc.) over a few weeks. Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic condition in the US. It affects 6 million children, causes 0.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, 0.13 million hospitalizations and $18 billion annually in healthcare costs. To reduce the burden of uncontrolled asthma, NHLBI evidence-based guidelines require periodic assessment of the child's asthma risk/impairment, and corresponding adjustments to treatment, until asthma control has been established. When assessing asthma impairment, pediatricians depend heavily on the self-report, which is unfortunately unreliable. This leads to underestimation of asthma impairment, undertreatment, and long paths to achieving control. To efficiently and effectively establish asthma control, a wearable device could be used to provide pediatricians an accurate, recent history of asthma components. Currently, no practical solutions exist for weeks-long monitoring of symptom frequency and lung function variability, both of which are critical components for assesing asthma impairment. Via the following Specific Aims, this application will use advances in embedded systems and machine learning to develop a small, wearable device for monitoring asthma symptoms that is (1) acceptable to patients; (2) able to robustly detect cough and wheeze symptoms; and (3) able to passively measure lung function variability. Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough epsiode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Project Narrative Uncontrolled pediatric asthma is a serious public health concern. There are proven therapies and management guidelines to achieve asthma control in most patients, but poor patient self-report of asthma daily symptoms and components has made this an elusive goal in practice. This project will develop and evaluate a wearable device that provides physicians with an accurate report of their patient's recent asthma symptoms and pulmonary function variability.",An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability,9774468,R41HL146027,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'New England', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spirometry', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Vital capacity', 'Wheezing', 'asthmatic patient', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'follow-up', 'monitoring device', 'off-patent', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatrician', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"CLAIRWAYS, LLC",R41,2019,204205,0.14095983233358206
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,9804142,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170640,0.1925039231860686
"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings.

"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9654855,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,120500,0.17964865287155238
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9665877,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2019,186948,0.13551736490870703
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9716628,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2019,763474,0.014363732688976538
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9757833,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2019,4129117,0.00323850354563817
"Determining the Role of the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiota as Drivers of Concomitant Inflammatory Responses in patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma 123 456 789 1101 1123 1145 1167 1189 2201 2223 2245 2267 2289 ABSTRACT Despite growing efforts to understand the role of the microbiota in airway disease, mechanisms that link microbial community dysbiosis to chronic inflammation remain elusive. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a significant health problem in the United States, costing up to $65 billion each year and affecting up to 16% of the US population. CRS patients frequently present with pulmonary comorbidities suggesting that there are common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to upper and lower airway inflammation, known as the unified airways concept. In this proposal, we aim to understand the role of the upper and lower airway microbiota in driving concurrent immune responses in patients with CRS and asthma. Asthma is a common pulmonary disease that has strong clinical and epidemiological associations with CRS: Between 20%- 60% of CRS patients with nasal polyps have asthma. Dysbiotic microbial communities have been reported in sinuses of CRS patients and in the lungs of asthmatics, however, the microbiome or host immune response of these sites have not been examined in parallel. The goal of this proposal is to establish the existence of an upper-lower airway axis by sequencing the bacterial and fungal microbiome, profiling the host immune response, and through in vitro experiments that aim to identify bacterial metabolites in mixed-species culture that drive type-2 inflammation. Supporting the concept of a unified airway, our preliminary data show dysbiotic microbial communities in the upper and lower airways of CRS patients with asthma and concurrent type-2 inflammation shared across the airway sites. To expand these studies, we will use an integrated multi-omics approach to investigate the fundamental basis of microbiome structure and function in the context of the immune response of patient-matched upper and lower airway samples from CRS patients (with or without asthma) and healthy individuals that we have banked over the past four years. From these analyses, we will be able to infer the ecological relationships that contribute to chronic inflammation in concurrent upper and lower airway disease. In the second aim, we will determine whether and how pathogenic microbial communities drive or exacerbate airway inflammatory responses in vitro. We will characterize the metabolome in CRS/Asthma- patients and confirm these metabolites are of microbial origin in mixed species biofilm culture. To determine interaction with the host, we will sensitize peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs) with CRS-Asthma associated metabolites, then co-culture DCs with naïve T cells and quantify T cell differentiation. This study will contribute to our understanding of the upper-lower airway axis in unified airway disease and will ultimately lead to therapeutics aimed a manipulating the upper airway microbiome for treating concurrent sinus and lung disease. 1234 567  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma are significant public health problem, accounting for over 5% of the  total healthcare costs in the United States each year. Dysbiosis of the sinonasal microbiome has been  proposed as a significant driver of airway inflammation, however the composition or activities of these complex 89  microbial assemblages are not well understood. The studies proposed here will provide a high-resolution  characterization of the airway bacterial microbiome and metabolome CRS patients with asthma. Mechanistic in  vitro studies of CRS/asthma associated metabolites will uncover specific microbial mechanisms that  exacerbate host inflammatory responses in the upper and lower airways.

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

This project aims to expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and advance identification of lncRNAs that play functional roles in psoriasis pathogenesis.",Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology,9761992,K01AR072129,"['Affect', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'London', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'skin disorder', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistical center', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,98982,-0.017847819316866857
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,-0.005660208726756569
"Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Climate change will lead to more intense and longer-lasting extreme weather events, such as floods, hurricanes, and severe storms, which will lead to more frequent power outage (PO). Significant gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of PO on human health: most previous studies were based on self-reported survey data, which is subject to reporting bias. In addition to weather factors that directly affect human health, other concurrent factors such as PO may also mediate with extreme weather on health, for which research is also lacking. Few studies assessed both power infrastructures and population vulnerabilities, and compared the effects of different PO causes. Furthermore, no health prediction models have been developed for PO. To fill these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will build upon multiple ongoing/ completed studies to: 1) assess the effects and mediating pathways of PO on electricity-dependent health outcomes, co-morbidities, and nursing home transfers; 2) identify infrastructure, environmental, and population vulnerabilities (individual and community); and 3) develop a vulnerability index and prediction model. We will effectively link the accessible New York statewide hospital admission and emergency department (ED) visit data with the existing data on PO, weather, air pollution, census, and nursing home transfer data. The associations between PO causes, frequency, duration, or area coverage of PO and electricity-dependent hospitalizations or ED visits due to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning will be assessed through Bayesian spatial-temporal model. This advanced technique will be able to control for both socio-demographic differences by regions and multiple temporal variables simultaneously. To improve scientific rigor, we will use control days (without PO and extreme weather) to separate PO from weather effects, and control diseases (e.g. appendicitis) to examine temporal changes of disease reporting. To understand PO’s natural direct and indirect effects, causal mediation analysis will be used. Furthermore, new variable selection methods, including Sure Independence Screening and Generalized Additive Model Selection will be used to screen and select predictors highly associated with outcomes. A composite vulnerability index weighed by risk factors identified and vulnerability maps will be developed. We will establish PO and PO-related health predictive models using the state-of-the-art data mining techniques, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Tree, and Ensemble Learning Decision Tree model. The excellent team with multidisciplinary and experienced investigators, numerous already collected and geocoded datasets, innovative data mining and analysis methods, continuation of student training, and successful prior partnerships with government agencies will maximize the probability of our success and feasibility. This project will also significantly enhance our institute’s environment and students’ involvement in research, and our findings will identify evidence-based strategies for emergency management and public health preparedness. NARRATIVE The proposed study will evaluate whether frequency, duration, coverage, and certain causes of power outage (PO) are associated with increased risks of electricity-dependent diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dialysis, water-/food-borne diseases, injury, and carbon monoxide poisoning. This may be the first study to assess whether people with certain demographic characteristics (e.g. elderly or different sex), living in a neighborhood with certain vulnerabilities (e.g. high land coverage or low hospital density), in certain seasons, degree of urbanicity, or specific causes of PO are more vulnerable to the impact of PO. The findings, vulnerability index and maps, and the forecast models derived from this study will help guide the state or federal environmental and health agencies to plan interventions and climate adaptation programs.","Assess and Model the Health Effects, Population, and Infrastructural Vulnerabilities of Power Outage",9440510,R15ES028000,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Carbon Monoxide Poisoning', 'Censuses', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Climate', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Electricity', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Equipment Failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Floods', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic Factor', 'Government Agencies', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neighborhoods', 'New York', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Seasons', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Trees', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'Weather', 'Work', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder control', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'extreme heat', 'foodborne', 'forest', 'health data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'screening', 'sex', 'student training', 'success']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT ALBANY,R15,2018,443750,0.0208287134135824
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9472205,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,714746,0.19600498611730321
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9707680,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2018,49524,0.15091254931918527
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9571016,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,12971526,0.10276695949406706
"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research.

"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated. Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9406513,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'bioinformatics resource', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'data warehouse', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,40590,0.01970928613969724
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9568024,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2018,4132864,0.00323850354563817
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9560840,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2018,2667664,-0.005660208726756569
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma.

"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9395534,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Smoking', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2017,49044,0.15091254931918527
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9404235,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,991019,0.10276695949406706
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9246341,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Centers', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,377370,0.19547455696174793
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9189635,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Notification', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Integration', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiologic data', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,38800,0.01970928613969724
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9479556,U01MH115727,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2017,4412707,0.00323850354563817
"Center for Environmental Genetics This application requests a 5-year renewal of the Center for Environmental Genetics. The unified theme of  the proposal is to elucidate how gene and environment interaction through epigenetics influences disease  risks and health outcome. Ohioans are exposed to exceptionally bad air quality due to dated power plants  and the fact that it is situated in the nation's main artery of the north-south transportation route. These unique  geographical/economic features put the residents in the state at high risk of the following diseases: (a)  endocrine disruption and cancer; (b) immune and allergic diseases; (c) cardiovascular and lipid disorders;  and (d) neurology and behavior disorders. The CEG has 20-years' of accumulative success in environmental  health sciences (EHS) research, our aspiration is to help mitigate these environmental diseases, first in Ohio,  then extend our success to similar populations in the nation and around the globe. Here we propose to attain  our goal by (1) expanding EHS research human capital through the continued recruitment and support of  investigators of all levels to EHS research, (2) innovative ideas and collaborative work from new and  established investigators will be supported by the Pilot Project Program and Director's Fund, (3) junior  investigators will be mentored by a Career Development Program and strong mentor-mentee relationships;  (4) an Integrative Technology Support Core combined with a Bioinformatics Core will provide investigators  with leading-edge technologies and data analysis to attain a new level of system-biology approach to EHS;  (5) enhancement activities such as workshops, symposia and seminar series will be used to stimulate  collaboration and innovation; (6) an Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core will provide the toolbox for  translation of EHS to the clinical and human studies; and (7) a Community Outreach and Engagement Core  will serve to translate EHS to public health and health education for healthier living and disease prevention.

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9360448,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2017,906404,0.014363732688976538
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9284482,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2017,152840,0.06677764325486675
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability.

"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive approach to asthma management.",SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care,9294106,R01HD087132,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Albuterol', 'Algorithms', 'Ambrosia', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clupeidae', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dust', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Wind', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Finding by Cause', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inhalators', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nebulizer', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Notification', 'Office Visits', 'Ontology', 'Ozone', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pollen', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Serinus', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'asthma prevention', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'grass pollen', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'member', 'men', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'operation', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tree pollen', 'trend', 'web services']",NICHD,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,338661,0.17159620500298325
"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8995191,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,238500,0.1345861408581153
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma.

"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9032521,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,383120,0.19547455696174793
"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9066670,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,152840,0.06677764325486675
"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9139479,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2016,2741022,-0.005660208726756569
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.                ",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8860691,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,198750,0.1345861408581153
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,8941822,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,707364,0.19600498611730321
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma,8847988,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2015,221134,0.16755292977490385
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.            ",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,8853379,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,388870,0.19547455696174793
"Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There has been a tremendous focus in bioinformatics on translation of data from the bench into information and knowledge for clinical decision-making. This includes analysis of human genetics for personalized medicine and treatment. However, there has been much less attention on translational bioinformatics for public health practice such as surveillance of emerging/re-emerging viruses. This involves data acquisition, integration, and analyses of viral genetics to infer origin, spread, and evolution suc as the emergence of new strains. The relevant scientific fields for this practice include certain aspects of molecular epidemiology and phylogeography. Recent attention has focused on viruses of zoonotic origin, which are defined as pathogens that are transmittable between animals and humans. In addition to seasonal influenza and West Nile virus, this classification of pathogens includes novel viruses such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and influenza A H7N9. Despite the successes highlighted in the literature, there has been little utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools among state public health, agriculture, and wildlife agencies for zoonotic surveillance. Previously this type of resource has been restricted primarily to those in academia.       While bioinformatics has been sparsely used for surveillance of zoonotic viruses, other applications such as Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) have been employed by state health agencies to analyze spatial patterns of infection. This includes software to produce disease maps using an array of data types such as clinical, geographical, or human mobility data for tasks such as, geocoding, clustering, or outbreak detection. In addition, advances in geospatial statistics have enabled health agencies to perform more powerful space-time analyses to infer spatiotemporal patterns. However, these GIS consider only traditional epidemiological data such as location and timing of reported cases and not the genetics of the virus that causes the disease. This prevents health agencies from understanding how changes in the genome of the virus and the associated environment in which it disseminates impacts disease risk.      The long-term goal of this proposal is to enhance the identification of geospatial hotspots of zoonotic viruses by applying bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics and spatiotemporal reportable disease data. This project will include approaches from bioinformatics, genetics, spatial statistics, GIS, and epidemiology. To do this, I will first measue the utilization of bioinformatics resources and tools as well as the current approaches and limitations identified by state agencies of public health, agriculture, and wildlife for detecting nd predicting hotspots (clusters) of zoonotic viruses (Aim 1). I will then use this feedback to develo a spatial decision support system for detecting and predicting zoonotic hotspots that applies bioinformatics principles to access, integrate, and analyze viral genetics, environmental, and spatiotemporal reportable disease data (Aim 2). In Aim 3, I will then evaluate my system for cluster detection and prediction against a system that does not consider viral genetics and relies on traditional spatiotemporal data, and perform validation of the predictive capability. Additional evaluation of the user's satisfaction and system usability will be evaluated.               Project Narrative I will develop and evaluate a spatial decision support system to support surveillance of zoonotic viruses in both human and animal populations. I will use approaches from bioinformatics and public health to integrate genetic sequence data from the virus with data from cases of reported infectious diseases and associated environmental data. A surveillance system that considers the genetics and environment of the virus along with public health data will assist public health officials in making informed decisions regarding risk of infectious diseases.",Integrating Bioinformatics and Clustering Analysis for Disease Surveillance,9050106,F31LM012176,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biodiversity', 'Bioinformatics', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genbank', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H7N9 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Satellite Viruses', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'West Nile virus', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'data acquisition', 'disorder risk', 'health data', 'high risk', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'seasonal influenza', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'virus classification', 'virus genetics']",NLM,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2015,36613,0.01970928613969724

"Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (DSCIC) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population. To address the critical need to create a central data and software resource for integrating and facilitating access, analysis, and dissemination of data and software generated within the PRISMS program, we are proposing the University of Southern California PRISMS Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (USC PRISMS DSCIC). Our team will work closely with the other two arms of PRISMS to coordinate and integrate outputs from the program's informatics platform centers that collect, analyze and present data from pediatric sensor-based health monitoring systems with an initial focus on pediatric asthma. We will ultimately address significant data science and tool development challenges associated with integrated monitoring systems datasets to enable important advances in our understanding of environmental determinants of pediatric asthma. Our proposal is structured around the four main research objectives specified in the RFA: 1) Integrated Knowledge Environment; 2) Data Integration; 3) Collaborative Environments and Technologies; and 4) Unified Access to PRISMS PTC Resources. The team is led by Co-PIs Drs. Jose Luis Ambite and Frank Gilliland at USC. Outdoor air pollution at levels occurring in many urban areas around the world has substantial adverse effects on health. Children in general, and children with asthma in particular, are sensitive to the adverse effects of outdoor air pollutants, includin ozone, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matter. The prevalence of asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010, while children aged 0-17 years had asthma prevalence of 9.5%, compared to adults aged 18 and over at 7.7%, for the period 2008-2010. Consistent with the increased vulnerability of children, a large and growing number of studies show that children living near traffic or high levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM have increased risks of adverse respiratory effects, such as new-onset asthma, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, school absences, and asthma-related hospitalizations. Ongoing studies also show that genetic variations in antioxidant and inflammatory genes play a role in ozone susceptibility. New methods in big data science are providing powerful tools for confronting critical research questions in asthma, in a range of areas from genomics to health informatics to environmental research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher. n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8916113,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2015,175392,-0.023028737791097372

Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",8852128,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,152840,0.06677764325486675

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,8934878,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Control Locus', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2015,2836708,-0.005660208726756569
"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8688300,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2014,1919404,0.1412118021062099
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.             Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data. The methods and tools are developed and evaluated in an imaging genetic study of Alzheimer's disease, and can also be applied to many other disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics,8714056,R01LM011360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Beds', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heart', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Simulate', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'base', 'cohort', 'density', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'public-private partnership', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2014,330386,-0.00033011465850266153
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8727091,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2014,80611,0.16755292977490385
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset.

To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation. Building upon our success as the PAGE I CC, we have added additional investigators with expertise in these areas and consortium experience with next-generation sequence analysis of both whole-genome and exome data. Our collaborative team is ideally staffed to meet the challenges of the new round of PAGE.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The PAGE study focuses on analysis of existing large samples of primarily non- European ancestry to broaden our understanding of the ethnic differences in the genetic basis of complex disease.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8726983,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2014,175392,-0.023028737791097372
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8516556,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2013,1864564,0.1412118021062099
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.        Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8724089,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2013,237047,0.16755292977490385

"NHGRI PAGE Coordinating Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): NHGRI developed the Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) research program to identify and characterize genomic variants in non-European populations. To support the complexities of such an ambitious effort, we have convened a strong team of statistical, population, and molecular geneticists, computer and information scientists, biostatisticians, and project management staff with many years of related experience to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC). Specifically, the CC will serve as a centralized resource to facilitate and support the activities of the program and Study Investigators focused on characterization of causal variants by: (1) coordinating phenotype harmonization efforts, including mapping phenotype variables across studies and to the PhenX measures; (2) synthesizing individual-level data into centralized datasets to facilitate sharing of data within and outside of PAGE; (3) utilizing state-of-the-art computer and information science support and scientific workflows that will facilitate analyses, ancestry deconvolution, genotype calling and imputation, SNP annotation, and data synthesis; (4) rapidly disseminating all study data via dbGaP and/or the PAGE website or other applicable databases; and (5) serving as a centralized resource to facilitate, support, and manage program activities and logistics as requested by the Steering Committee or Project Office and as needed for successful coordination of the program. Coordination of the program will be done in a spirit of collaboration using creative and flexible approaches, while providing leadership in statistical genetic methodologies and approaches to project management. The ultimate goal of our CC is to facilitate the identification and characterization of genotype-phenotype associations, especially as relevant to non-European populations, thereby accelerating our understanding of ancestral differences in the genetic and environmental causes of common diseases. Critical to achieving this mission is the deployment of powerful methods for ancestry deconvolution, multi- and trans-ethnic mapping, and imputation.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8535152,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'risk variant', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2013,175392,-0.023028737791097372
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8296583,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2012,1958575,0.1412118021062099
"Bioinformatics Strategies for Multidimensional Brain Imaging Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Today's generation of multi-modal imaging systems produces massive high dimensional data sets, which when coupled with high throughput genotyping data such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and the genetic architecture of human diseases. However, the unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools. To address these challenges, using the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a test bed, this project will develop and validate novel bioinformatics strategies for multidimensional brain imaging genetics. Aim 1 is to develop a novel bi- multivariate analysis strategy, S3K-CCA, for studying imaging genetic associations. Existing imaging genetics methods are typically designed to discover single-SNP-single-QT, single-SNP-multi-QT or multi-SNP-single- QT associations, and have limited power in revealing complex relationships between interlinked genetic markers and correlated brain phenotypes. To overcome this limitation, S3K-CCA is designed to be a sparse bi- multivariate learning model that simultaneously uses multiple response variables with multiple predictors for analyzing large-scale multi-modal neurogenomic data. Aim 2 is to develop HD-BIG, a visualization and systems biology framework for integrative analysis of High-Dimensional Brain Imaging Genetics data. Machine learning strategies to seamlessly incorporate valuable domain knowledge to produce biologically meaningful results is still an under-explored area in imaging genetics. In this aim, we will develop a user-friendly heat map interface to visualize high-dimensional results, adjust learning parameters and strategies, interact with existing bioinformatics resources and tools, and facilitate visual exploratory and systems biology analysis. A novel imaging genetic enrichment analysis (IGEA) method will be developed to identify relevant genetic pathways and associated brain circuits, and to reveal complex relationships among them. Aim 3 is to evaluate the proposed S3K-CCA and IGEA methods and the HD-BIG framework using both simulated and real imaging genetics data. This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale heterogeneous imaging genetics data. The availability of these powerful methods is critical to the success of many imaging genetics initiatives. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in other areas of biomedical research where systematic and integrative analysis of large-scale multi-modal data is critical. Using AD as an exemplar, the proposed methods will demonstrate the potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders, which can benefit public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.              Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Recent advances in multi-modal imaging and high throughput genotyping techniques provide exciting opportunities to enhance our understanding of phenotypic characteristics and underlying genetic mechanisms associated with human diseases. This proposal seeks to develop new bi-multivariate machine learning models and novel enrichment analysis methods, coupled with a visualization and systems biology framework, for integrative analysis of high-dimensional brain imaging genetics data.

"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.              Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes).

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide, results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.         By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma. Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.

"Molecular Genetic Investigation of Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by varying degrees of cytopenias, and ineffective and dysplastic hematopoiesis. MDS can be classified as primary de novo MDS with no apparent underlying cause and secondary MDS following congenital or acquired bone marrow failure (BMF) disorders or cytotoxic therapies. Little is known about initiating events leading to pediatric MDS. As a result, no targeted therapies exist and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapeutic option.  The heterogeneous clinical and laboratory presentation and limited availability of clinically well-annotated patient samples and in vivo models have posed significant obstacles to study the disease and to identify genetic alterations unique to pediatric MDS. Therefore pediatric MDS remains largely classified by morphologic and cytogenetic criteria that provide few clues as to the molecular basis. Over the last 18 months, we have developed the first nationwide comprehensive Pediatric MDS and BMF Disorder Patient Registry and Tissue Repository now involving 3 institutions and continuing to grow. The registry has collected samples from > 60 individual patients in addition to biological material from 3 unique kindreds with pediatric MDS. These samples form the basis for our first genomic sequencing analysis to gather preliminary data for future experiments and represent the power of this registry to elucidate pathogenic mutations associated with MDS.  Our unique team of investigators will exploit the registry and catalyze our efforts to determine the fundamental underpinnings of pediatric MDS. The team includes David Williams (clinical/translational hematology), Mark Fleming (pediatric hematopathology /hematological genetics), Benjamin Ebert (high throughput genomic technologies in adult MDS) and Kyriacos Markinanos (genetic linkage analysis). We will undertake preliminary studies to demonstrate feasibility, and generate genomic data that will provide the basis for future hypothesis-driven translational and clinical research studies on a national level.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The underlying genetics and pathophysiology of pediatric MDS is poorly understood. By exploiting several well-characterized families with inherited MDS, we will aim to identify the genetic basis for this disorder.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.       n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8308347,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2012,175392,-0.023028737791097372

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries. This project seeks support from the NIDA R25 research education program in statistical genetics of substance abuse.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.                Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8139116,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2011,1957381,0.1412118021062099
"Using signatures of T-helper cell inflammation to phenotype human asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common disease characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. There is growing recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity in asthma, including in severity and response to medication. It is likely that these differences are driven by distinct underlying molecular phenotypes, the discovery of which would inform the development of targeted therapies. In prior studies using well-characterized patients with asthma, differences in gene expression from human airway epithelial cells identified two major groups of patients, one in which gene expression is strongly driven by the inflammatory the T-helper cell (Th2) cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which has been called Th2 ""high"" asthma, and another in which IL-13 driven genes are not significantly expressed above that level found in healthy controls, or ""Th2 low"" asthma. This work demonstrated that compared to Th2-low asthmatics, Th2-high subjects a better response to inhaled corticosteroids. Based on published data and our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that Th1 and Th17 pathways of inflammation define additional molecular phenotypes of human asthma. Our aims are to test this hypothesis, associate phenotypes to clinical characteristics including response to corticosteroids, and develop diagnostic tools for molecular phenotyping of human subjects based on Th1, Th2 and Th17 signatures. Th1, Th2, and Th17 signatures will be developed from microarray- based whole genome expression-profiling of cytokine-stimulated epithelial cell lines. These signatures will be used to cluster research asthma subjects into T helper subset phenotypes based on the gene expression profiles of their own airway epithelial cells obtained. The most informative epithelial cell genes will be used to develop a PCR-based test. A non-invasive test for these molecular phenotypes will be developed through the use of machine learning algorithms to find patterns in the whole genome expression profiles of subjects' peripheral blood samples. The identification of molecular phenotypes, and the availability of reliable tests to assign Th2, Th1, or Th17 phenotypes non-invasively would provide the potential to predict which medication will work best for an individual while avoiding unnecessary side effects form ineffective therapies, and to inform the development of therapies targeted to specific phenotypes by providing biomarkers during clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications. Asthma has many forms with varying triggers, long-term outcomes and responses to medications. The goals of this work are to 1) apply technological advances in human genomics to discover distinct classes of asthma, and 2) develop tests based on these classes to predict which individuals will respond to a specific therapy, leading to more efficient care and less side effects from ineffective medicines.              Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide, results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma. Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.            By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk.

"Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Common mental disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia are largely heritable with complex genetic underpinnings. Large-scale genome-wide association studies that contrast DNA sequence data from patients and controls have recently identified novel genetic risk variants for these disorders. Nevertheless, the processes through which genotype increases risk are yet to be fully characterized.  Neuroimaging offers a richer picture of the underlying disease processes than a clinical diagnosis. Thus the joint analysis of neuroimaging and genetics data promises to advance our understanding of these processes. Today, neuroimaging genetics studies however face important challenges that obstruct progress: small sample sizes, modest effect sizes, and the extreme dimensionality of the data limit statistical power and thus our ability to explore the complex and subtle associations between genes, neuroanatomy and clinical decline. Currently, the prevalent approach in neuroimaging genetics is to concentrate the analysis on a small number of anatomic regions of interest and/or candidate genes and often ignore a large portion of the data. The core goal of the proposed project is to develop computational tools that will take full advantage of the richness in the datasets and facilitate the exploration of the multifaceted associations between genotype, neuroimaging measurements and clinical phenotype. The proposed project will use advanced multivariate pattern analysis methods such as support vector machines to compute image-based and genetic scores that reflect pathology. We will validate the tools based on their association with classical biomarkers of disease. Finally, we will develop a model that uses both imaging and genotype data to predict future clinical outcome. We expect these tools will enable progress along three directions relevant to complex mental disorders, e.g. late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD): (1) confirming and characterizing risk genes, (2) identifying disease-specific anatomical alterations in healthy individuals, and (3) early diagnosis and prognosis. The project will (1) use three already-collected large-scale datasets to apply the developed tools to AD, (2) build on cutting-edge image processing algorithms that we have been developing, and (3) allow the candidate to receive further training in neuroanatomy, mental disorders and genetics, forming the foundation for his future career as an independent researcher.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative/Relevance We will develop computational tools for analyzing complex associations between images, genotype and clinical phenotype. The tools will be user-friendly and freely available, and will potentially facilitate accurate early diagnosis and prognosis of mental disorders such as Alzheimer's.             n/a",Multivariate Pattern Analysis Methods for Neuroimaging Genetics Studies,8165447,K25EB013649,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical phenotype', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'disorder risk', 'entorhinal cortex', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'molecular pathology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'tool']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K25,2011,175392,-0.02613715095921431
"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.           Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,7867594,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2010,1992800,0.1412118021062099

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor.

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7633295,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,293485,0.014416196927224468

"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development.

"Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  To address the large discrepancy between consensus quality standards and healthcare services actually delivered to those eligible, the Institute of Medicine has called for new quality initiatives and has identified asthma as one if its priority areas. Each year, thousands of preventable deaths are attributed to asthma. The asthma-related health burden is especially pronounced in vulnerable populations. Opportunities to improve asthma care quality hinge on the capacity to comprehensively and routinely assess the care that is actually delivered to asthma patients. Current quality measurement studies require extensive clinical chart review and are not cost-effective on a public health scale. Healthcare information technology (Health IT) could have a big impact by enabling automated quality assessments. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture clinical information that could make comprehensive, cost effective quality assessment possible. However, much relevant information (and perhaps 50% or more of the necessary data) resides in free-text clinical notes, which presents a significant challenge to automated quality assessment. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient asthma care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7498546,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2008,395816,0.09342792327448243

"Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a near complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior at the molecular and cellular levels.  The ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function such as addiction.  However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely.  Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system functions, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of behavioral phenotypes.   The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the behavioral patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatment in C. elegans.  By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of uncoordinated, locomotion-abnormal mutants, these tools will be particularly useful for correlation specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns.  These analytical tools will also be used to precisely define the long-term effects of neuroactive drugs on behavioral, opening the possibility of genetic screening for mutants with defects in tolerance and dependence. n/a",Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.,6569575,R21DA015823,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', ' automated data processing', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug addiction', ' gene mutation', ' genetic screening', ' genome', ' invertebrate locomotion', ' mutant', ' neural transmission', ' neurophysiology', ' neuropsychology', ' nicotine', ' nicotinic receptors', ' phenotype', ' substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R21,2002,152000,0.00144134281617657

"AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TELEPHONIC MGMT OF ASTHMA Asthma is a highly prevalent disease with a significant morbidity                leading to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and absenteeism from          work and school. Two major factors contributing to asthma morbidity (and         mortality) are failure to detect asthma decompensation and use of                inappropriate treatment strategies. Asthma severity can be assessed by           clinical symptoms and peak flow measurements. There are internationally          accepted guidelines for asthma management. However, rapid translation            of asthma symptoms into a change in therapy is frequently impeded by the         patient's inability to understand self management, reluctance to contact         the health care provider, or delays in feedback from the provider to the         patient. The objective of the proposal is to develop and clinically              evaluate a new Automated System for Telephonic Home Management of                Asthma.                                                                                                                                                           We describe the design and alpha testing of a dynamic relational                 database (DRdb) suitable for use either in a isolated PC or in a                 distributed computer system to support daily reporting and facilitate            all provider monitoring. The resulting DRdb accepts information about            the patient, their specific diagnoses and treatment regimens. Each DRdb          is accessible on-line, linked through LAN or WAN and captures the                patient's symptoms and measurements at the moment when they are                  reported. Because the patient's history is electronically available, the         DRdb can dynamically support the health professional to relay                    instructions immediately. Generally these instructions are pre-defined           by the patient's doctor for the reported symptom set. Automation of              these procedures may be possible.                                                                                                                                 Specifically, we are developing a custom telephone interface, conducting         a clinical trial in both adult and pediatric populations in which asthma         management is under constant physician direction and where asthma                intervention is (I) computer-assisted, (II) computer-mediated, or (III)          according to conventional methods (Control Group). We measure end-points         relevant to disease managers(costs), to health care providers(time) and          to asthmatic patients(respiratory outcomes). The goals of the Asthma             system described in this proposal are to save time (efficacy), and               increase patient and health care provider satisfaction (attractiveness).

"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9986880,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data de-identification', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public repository', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2020,13299576,0.10276695949406706
"Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns PROJECT SUMMARY  As a neurointensivist and neurologist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WUSM), my career goal is to develop an independent research program as a computational biologist capable of using advanced bioinformatics and statistical methods to integrate analysis of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data, with the aim of deepening understanding of the biological mechanisms influencing cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and identifying new targets for therapeutic development. As a first step towards this goal, I have designed an innovative proposal that combine machine-learning (ML) methods and integrated imaging genetic analyses of large-scale neuroimaging and genetic data to improve characterization of SVD disease mechanisms.  The clinical, imaging, and etiologic heterogeneity of SVD have impeded efforts to uncover the pathophysiology of this common and debilitating neurological disease. White matter hyperintensities (WMH), a major imaging endpoint of SVD, are comprised of multiple SVD pathologic processes. Growing evidence suggests location-specific vulnerability of brain parenchyma to different underlying SVD pathologic processes, in which spatially localized WMH patterns may reflect distinct SVD etiologies. Characterizing WMH spatial pattern variations in SVD will not only provide insights into underlying pathogenesis, such as vascular amyloid deposition, arteriolosclerosis, and other less well defined or as-yet unknown disease mechanisms, but also lead to creation of novel imaging biomarkers of these SVD pathologic processes. This proposal addresses a key inadequacy, as existing WMH pattern definitions are determined empirically and cannot distinguish overlapping SVD etiologies and risk factors. In this proposal, I aim to capture WMH spatial pattern variations that reflect distinct SVD etiologies in an unbiased manner, by applying clustering analysis/ML methods to structural MRI data to create novel etiology-specific SVD imaging phenotypes. Moreover, given that genetics influence the variance of WMH, I will integrate genetic analyses of these WMH patterns to uncover novel mechanisms that influence SVD pathogenesis. My preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of identifying data-driven WMH spatial pattern variations, which are specific to distinct SVD etiologies, and allow detection of genetic risk variants that may help inform SVD pathologic processes.  My career plan leverages the extensive resources and exceptional environments at WUSM, under the guidance of a multidisciplinary mentorship team with expertise across diverse fields including cerebrovascular physiology, neuroimaging, informatics, genetics, and machine learning (Drs. Jin-Moo Lee, Daniel Marcus, Carlos Cruchaga and Yasheng Chen). In this Career Development Award, I propose to: 1) determine distinct WMH spatial patterns that can discriminate underlying SVD pathology and/or risk factors by applying pattern analysis ML methods to structural MRI data from three unique cohorts (n=2,710) enriched for different SVD pathologies (Aim 1a), and examining if the ML-defined WMH patterns segregate individuals by well-defined SVD risk factors as biologic validation (Aim 1b), and 2) identify genetic variants (Aim 2a) associated with WMH patterns that reflect diverse pathologic processes influencing SVD using genome wide association and gene-based analyses; replicate the top variants (Aim 2b) in an independent population-based cohort (n=21,708); and use advanced bioinformatics tools to uncover new biologic pathways associated with WMH spatial patterns (Aim 2c).  This research proposal and accompanying development plan with focused training in machine learning, neuroimaging, and multivariate methods for integrated imaging genetics analysis, will build on my background in genetics towards a career investigating cerebrovascular disorders using translational bioinformatics. This Award will provide me with the necessary training to evolve into an independent investigator with a computational research program that can integrate large imaging and genetics datasets to derive results that are highly relevant to the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular disease in my clinical patient population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions in older adults, and a leading cause of stroke and cognitive impairment, for which existing treatment and preventative options have been limited or lack efficacy. This project’s goal is to enhance our knowledge of the complex disease processes underlying SVD using machine learning and integrating individual imaging and genetic data from over 20,000 adults. By understanding these disease processes, we can design novel methods to more effectively treat and prevent stroke and dementia.",Integrating Machine Learning and Genomic Approaches to Understand Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Pathogenesis from White Matter Hyperintensity Patterns,10022173,K23NS110927,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Archives', 'Arteries', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Physiology', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lobar', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'arteriole', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'brain parenchyma', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypertension control', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population based', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'risk variant', 'serial imaging', 'stroke therapy', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,178809,-0.020463070576564553
"OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic pediatric disease in the United States, affecting 6.2 million or 1 in 12 children. Despite advances in the management of childhood asthma, asthma exacerbation results in approximately 550,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 80,000 hospitalizations, and hundreds of premature deaths each year. Early symptoms of asthma exacerbation, especially in children, are nonspecific and are unfortunately often not recognized by parents as asthma until the child demonstrates more severe symptoms, enough to require emergent care. The long-term goal of this STTR initiative is to empower parents to initiate timely therapy for acute asthma by supplementing their subjective assessment with an objective measure of acute asthma severity. The mobile technology we propose to develop, test and deploy toward this goal will use digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) to determine three distinct severity zones (corresponding to the green, yellow and red zones on the asthma action plan) allowing parents to follow asthma action plans accurately. The resulting improved and timely home-based management of childhood asthma should reduce current excessive ED utilization and unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality. The proposed technology is inspired by and based on the pediatric asthma severity score (PASS). PASS is used in many pediatric EDs for objective assessment of acute asthma severity to aid management of acute asthma and critical discharge and hospitalization decisions. The components of PASS are five well-studied and validated clinical parameters. Our goal in the proposed project is to develop new technology that enables parents to make similar measurements in the home setting and map those to the 3 color-coded zones for easier execution of asthma action plans. The 2 specific aims of the project are to 1) build a pediatric asthma database with ground-truth clinical findings, and 2) develop and validate DSP and ML algorithms for automated assessment of acute asthma severity. The successful completion of these aims will result in a validated technology suitable for objective, home-based assessment of acute asthma severity. Such assessment is currently possible but only in medical facilities by trained medical staff. Our Phase II goals will be to (a) further improve and deploy the technology in homes and (b) conduct a prospective trial measuring its feasibility, utilization and effectiveness in controlling asthma emergencies and costs. In Phase II, we will also pursue the necessary regulatory approvals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children associated with high rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. These problems exist because families find it difficult to recognize the symptoms of asthma. The goal of this project is to develop novel technology suitable for home use that will make recognizing the symptoms of asthma easier, leading to timely administration of medication and avoidance of serious complications.",OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING,10010457,R41NR019735,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auscultation', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergent care', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oxygen', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speech', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wheezing', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work of Breathing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic patient', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'digital', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication administration', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'premature', 'prospective', 'respiratory']",NINR,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R41,2020,257878,0.16977081923685733
"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children that is frequently evaluated and managed by pediatric residents. No training tools are available that provide individualized feedback on residents' competence in asthma care and documentation from their clinical notes. We address this challenge by developing an automated tool to provide data-driven feedback to individual residents to enhance their competence in asthma care and documentation.",Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation,9828754,R21AI142702,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data quality', 'graduate medical education', 'individualized feedback', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'structured data', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2020,198750,0.17066818628869598
"Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma Candidate: Dr. Soyeon Kim obtained her Ph.D. degree in Statistics at Rice University. For her doctoral research, she developed statistical machine learning methods to identify biomarkers for precision medicine approaches to treating lung cancer. She is currently a post-doctoral fellow at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP) and supported by a T32 grant awarded to one of her mentors, Dr. Juan C. Celedón. The goal of her research is to understand the pathogenesis of diseases by developing statistical methods for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. She is an author and co-author of eight manuscripts, including ones in high-profile journals such as Nature Genetics. Environment: CHP, affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine, is a leading pediatric center for clinical care, research, and educational excellence. Dr. Kim works in the Rangos Research Center, comprised of nine floors of state-of-the-art laboratories, offices, and conference facilities. In addition to superb mentoring by Drs. Wei Chen, Juan C. Celedón and George Tseng, she will use the Pittsburgh supercomputing center (PSC), an excellent source of computing powers for intensive bioinformatics work. Research: Although both single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation play important roles in regulating gene expression, the associations between SNPs/DNA methylation and expression of disease genes in childhood asthma are mostly unknown. Due to the multiple-testing problem, most studies focus on identifying the regulation of gene expression by cis- (nearby) DNA features, rather than a combination of cis- and trans (far from genes) regulation. To overcome the major multiple-testing problem, we will develop a novel statistical machine learning method that can handle a large number of variables of omics data without multiple- testing correction issues. In Aim 1, I will identify cis and trans genetic (SNPs) and epigenetic (methylation) factors that regulate gene expression in the nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. Through this analysis, I will uncover novel SNPs and methylation CpGs that may have not been found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS). In Aim 2, I will estimate the genetic and epigenetic contributions to the expressions of genes that are associated with atopic asthma. This study also will classify genes that are affected the most by genetic factors and genes that are affected mostly by epigenetic factors, which include environmental factors. In Aim 3, I will develop statistical methods to identify SNPs that indirectly regulate gene expression through methylation in nasal epithelium of asthmatic and healthy subjects. The outcome of this work will be a better understanding of the abnormal molecular and cellular mechanisms through which asthma develops, and the application of this knowledge to help to produce new therapies for asthma. Project Narrative 6 million children in the US suffer from asthma, and the likelihood that any child will develop asthma depends heavily on their genetic and epigenetic regulations. My statistical machine learning models will identify new genetic and epigenetic risk factors that are associated with childhood asthma by regulating the expression of disease-causing or disease-preventing genes. This knowledge will help to advance precision medicine approaches to treating childhood asthma.",Identifying Genetic and Epigenetic Risk Factors Regulating Gene Expression for Childhood Asthma,10038897,K01HL153792,"['Affect', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CISH gene', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Floor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Puerto Rican', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rice', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Supercomputing', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Work', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical center', 'differential expression', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'genome wide association study', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2020,141178,0.06832465748699425
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,10000960,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal risk', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2020,50520,0.15091254931918527
"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9884782,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Air Movements', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,120750,0.17964865287155238
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10009430,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170640,0.1925039231860686
"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10041169,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,178200,0.15889151963589346
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9838149,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2020,186948,0.13551736490870703
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lungfunction variability Executive Summary of Predicate (One Page) Summary of Specific Aims of Phase I Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough episode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Progress towards Specific Aims As of today, January 21, 2020, the work on the predicate NIH STTR award has not yet begun. The work related to this NIH STTR is anticipated to begin April 2020. Prior to submitting our NIH STTR application, significant work was completed to test the viability of collecting lung function using our wearable technology. We tested on over 20 patients in the hospital, and in this study we found a positive correlation between our measurements and those of spirometry. Our NIH STTR work will build upon this. Technical, administrative, or commercial challenges and how they’ve been addressed During our customer discovery so far, we have learned about the complexities of achieving reimbursement, even if we have identified applicable CPT codes. Realizing this challenge, we selected an initial customer that will not require reimbursement. Our initial customer will be respiratory clinical trials. From our interviews, we have learned that they have a strong unmet need, they are willing to pay a large amount, and we will be able to serve them earlier than other customer types. We hope to explore this further during this NIH I-Corps program.

"Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome Addiction is a highly complex disease with risk factors that include genetic variants and differences in development, sex, and environment. The long term potential of precision medicine to improve drug treatment and prevention depends on gaining a much better understanding how genetics, drugs, brain cells, and neuronal circuitry interact to influence behavior. There are serious technical barriers that prevent researchers and clinicians from incorporating more powerful computational and predictive methods in addiction research. The purpose of the NIDA P30 Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome is to empower and train researchers supported by NIH, NIDA, NIAAA, and other federal and state institutions to use more quantitative and testable ways to analyze genetic, epigenetic, and the environmental factors that influence drug abuse risk and treatment. In the Transcriptome Informatics and Mechanisms research core we assemble and upgrade hundreds of large genome (DNA) and transcriptome (RNA) datasets for experimental rodent (rat) models of addiction. In the Systems Analytics and Modeling research core, we are using innovative systems genetics methods (gene mapping) to understand the linkage between DNA differences, environmental risks such as stress, and the differential risk of drug abuse and relapse. Our Pilot core is catalyzing new collaborations among young investigator in the field of addiction research. In sum the Center is a national resource for more reproducible research in addiction. We are centralizing, archiving, distributing, analyzing and integrating high quality data, metadata, using open software systems in collaboration with many other teams of researchers. Our goal is to help build toward an NIDA Addictome Portal that will include all genomic research relevant to addiction research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The NIDA Core Center of Excellence in Omics, Systems Genetics, and the Addictome (OSGA) provides genomic and computational support to a large number of research scientists working on mechanisms and treatment of addiction. The two main research cores of OSGA are providing support for transcriptome, epigenome, and metagenome studies of rat models of addiction at many levels of analysis. We are also creating open access tools and a powerful web portal to catalyze more effective and replicable use of massive datasets generated by programs in addiction biology and treatment.","Overall NIDA Core ""Center of Excellence"" in Transcriptomics, Systems Genetics and the Addictome",9929423,P30DA044223,"['Archives', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug abuse', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'brain cell', 'career', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data tools', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'digital imaging', 'drug relapse', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'graphical user interface', 'health record', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neurogenomics', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'ranpirnase', 'rat genome', 'repository', 'sex', 'single cell analysis', 'software systems', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,P30,2020,754121,0.014363732688976538
"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,9824678,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2020,181719,0.15578831323011388
"Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes Genetic studies have identified many specific loci with significant associations to psychiatric disorders. However, unless we can develop useful approaches for systematically turning genetic information into neurobiological insights about brain disorders, there is a danger that costly and hard-won genetic findings will not be exploitable to understand pathophysiology and generate important therapeutic hypotheses. The goal of our collaborative, interdisciplinary effort is to develop powerful, generalizable approaches for discovering how risk variants for psychiatric disorders shape neurobiological processes at multiple levels of analysis, and to identify the processes whose dysregulation underlies disease. To do this, we propose to develop new experimental and inferential systems to bridge a longstanding gap between human genetics and experimental biology. We aim to identify biological causes and effects that span the genetic, molecular, and cellular levels of the nervous system. Our interdisciplinary team will develop new experimental systems that measure genetic influences across levels of analysis (RNA, proteins, and cellular function including physiology) in precise, scalable, well- controlled ways. We will make use of emerging cellular systems including three-dimensional cortical spheroids and organoids, and radically novel “population in a dish” experimental systems that collect data on cells from hundreds of donors in a shared environment, inferring donor identity at the time of phenotypic readout. The analysis of such systems in turn requires sophisticated inferential strategies and new ideas from computer science. We propose to develop and widely share experimental and computational resources, including cell lines, methods, datasets, and analytic tools. The successful completion of this work will identify key neurobiological processes for multiple psychiatric disorders, and fortify many other scientists in making such connections in their own work. We hope in so doing to create a new kind of interdisciplinary science that – by combining the strengths of data-driven, unbiased human genetics with the power of emerging experimental systems – transforms the rate at which human- genetic leads lead to insights about disease mechanisms. To better understand common, severe psychiatric illnesses and develop improved treatments for them, we need to understand what specific aspects of brain biology give rise to each disorder. Here a team of scientists with diverse areas of expertise – from neuroscience to computer science to psychiatry to human genetics to stem cell biology – come together to develop a set of next-generation scientific approaches to this important problem, and to generate new methods and data sets that we will widely share. Our team will work to understand how aspects of brain biology at many levels – genes, molecules, and cells – act upon one another to create vulnerability to psychiatric illness.",Genetic neuroscience: How human genes and alleles shape neuronal phenotypes,9989904,U01MH115727,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'California', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investments', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychiatry', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'genetic information', 'human data', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'multidimensional data', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'rare variant', 'response', 'risk variant', 'stem cell biology', 'translational neuroscience', 'whole genome']",NIMH,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",U01,2020,4125261,0.00323850354563817
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a class of gene that has largely been understudied, and recent studies suggested their potential roles in autoimmune diseases. This project aims to expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and advance identification of lncRNAs that play functional roles in psoriasis pathogenesis.",Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology,10003820,K01AR072129,"['Affect', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'London', 'Lymphocyte', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'immunoregulation', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'skin disorder', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistical center', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,98982,-0.017847819316866857
