"Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks Project Summary/Abstract: There is significant current interest in understanding how neurons relate to whole-brain networks and how these networks coordinate to give rise to behavior. We have recently shown that we can decompose Local Field Potential voltage signals recorded from depth electrodes implanted in multiple brain regions into “electrical functional connectomes,” or electomes, which empirically are consistent between individuals in a population and are predictive of behavior. This provides a unique opportunity to use these consistent network properties to anchor and stratify neurons based on their relationship to whole-brain network dynamics, and this approach only uses data that is currently collected or could be collected with minor changes in protocol. This stratification will be consistent across animals, allowing examination of how neurons in different brains relate to whole-brain networks and to behaviors. This will facilitate closer examination of neuron activity by allowing stronger data aggregation across subjects. Neural encoding and decoding models will be required to be faithful at both the individual neuron level and the multi-region voltage dynamic level, constraining neural relationships by known and learned biological properties. This will be accomplished by first building upon our explainable machine learning approach for learning multi-region networks by including historical data to improve the utility of machine learning during pilot studies and creating novel stochastic optimization approaches for real-time mapping of observed data into the networks. Then, we will develop a model capable of embedding neurons into a shared space, where the embedding succinctly reveals how a neuron relates to the electomes. Finally, these vector embeddings will be used to relate neurons to both behavior and the multi-region dynamics in both single-trial and repeated-trial behavioral tasks. Remarkably, a neuron’s embedding and the state of the mesoscale networks can predict the neural encoding a priori to observing behavior and neural firing simultaneously in a new subject. The overarching goal of this proposal is to learn how neurons’ action potentials, long considered to be a fundamental unit of information, relate to whole-brain spatiotemporal voltage patterns and behavior. To uncover this relationship, we will develop novel computational methods capable of learning networks that relate voltage signals from multiple brain regions based upon our previously developed explainable machine learning approach. These networks will then be used to stratify neurons into subtypes consistent across a population of subjects to facilitate the statistical aggregation of data to uncover relationships between multiple scale of neural activity and behavior.",Uncovering Population-Level Cellular Relationships to Behavior via Mesoscale Networks,9775689,R01EB026937,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stratification', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'connectome', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'member', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,775000,0.02701673130304058
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics. Further, these experiments align with NIMH's mission to characterize the neural circuits of complex behaviors and mental illnesses.",Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles,9741538,F30MH115693,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Head', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological anxiety', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Ursidae Family', 'Viral', 'anxiety states', 'anxiety-related behavior', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'calcium indicator', 'conditioned fear', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'grasp', 'imaging approach', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F30,2019,36170,0.039550926595385734
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9696008,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'learning strategy', 'limb movement', 'microphone', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,521954,0.006816511620889911
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9792299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'computational basis', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,665648,-0.02825858152899014
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9798264,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'axonal guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,384007,-0.0016944489161712403
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9675333,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning ability', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,363758,0.0027937610646763303
"Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the natural acoustic environment. They adapt their hearing to emphasize the features of sound that are important for making behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. A better understanding of the function of the healthy and impaired auditory system will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will develop computational tools to study central auditory processing. A software library will support fitting and evaluating a large number of encoding models to describe the functional relationship between a time-varying natural auditory stimulus and the corresponding neural response. Many such models have been proposed, but relatively few direct comparisons have been made between them. This project will enable their comparison, allowing identification of the key features that contribute positively to their performance. The system will have a modular design so that useful elements from different models can be combined into comprehensive models with even greater explanatory power. The software will be open source and will support data from multiple recording modalities, including small-scale single unit electrophysiological and calcium imaging data, as well as large-scale local field and magnetoencephalography data. In addition to building on existing hypotheses about neural coding, the system will support machine learning methods for fitting artificial neural network models using the same datasets. These large, data-driven models have proven valuable for wide ranging signal processing problems, but their value and relation to existing models for neural sensory processing remain to be explored. Sensory processing involves coherent activity of large neural populations. To study coding at the population level, the system will support models that characterize the simultaneous activity of multiple neural signals and identifies latent subspaces of population activity related to sound encoding. Sensory coding is also influenced by behavioral context, reflecting changes in behavioral demands and the more general environment. The system will incorporate behavioral state variables into models, where encoding properties can be modulated by changes in behavioral context. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the neural populations in the healthy brain represent complex natural sounds. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Tools for modeling state-dependent sensory encoding by neural populations across spatial and temporal scales,9774688,R01EB028155,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual system structure', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'computerized tools', 'data format', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open source', 'receptive field', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'tool']",NIBIB,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,794000,0.05505530922941253
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9694232,R01EY026042,"['3-Dimensional', '4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,318065,0.008805487013828904
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9718308,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2019,530307,0.013708700778815856
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,9871513,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,134007,0.024199318961415577
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,9765324,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,254496,0.03977994814061599
"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update ‘mental models’ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A model’s complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the ‘complexity’ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to ‘overthinking’ while learning, whereas less complex models to ‘oversimplify’ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'career', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'information processing', 'insight', 'lens', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'norepinephrine system', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,0.02198112994968236
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals.

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9767893,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,359585,0.013162102111123588
"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9616849,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,35344,0.03725139063852757
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.004234543191684692
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9986132,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.006657149640323989
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9741542,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,455418,0.029774514386545717
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior.

"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,9800892,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,716265,-0.0020403785493970073
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9822873,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2019,192500,-0.005385919987852105
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9688607,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,385524,0.008164269437595595
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9665785,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,403711,-0.004301843234872809
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9835877,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2019,36528,-0.003869189987060384
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9654779,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,694087,-0.0017817725694779403
"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy. We will use computational modeling to identify biomarkers of co-morbid depression, and assess whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether presurgical neural features predict that improvement.",Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development,9890582,K23NS110962,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Refractory Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'suicide rate', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,200178,0.022858843656465618
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9735214,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'summer internship', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2019,268961,0.013591279494537088
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,9817780,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,367007,0.020971990954987366
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9625167,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,526760,0.013617355792711719
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9707904,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,446302,0.02030207296254601
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9789280,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,21171,0.0006357710710929324
"Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors,9744432,K99MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2019,110754,0.04630523210290329
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9832833,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2019,65854,0.021581350320467405
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge from the transcranial magnetic and electrical DC stimulation experiments may have translational applications for rehabilitation following brain injuries.",Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms,9718188,R01DC014736,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Music', 'Neurobiology', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related neurodegeneration', 'alpha-SNAP', 'attentional bias', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive process', 'cost shifting', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'image guided', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'prefrontal lobe', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R01,2019,263449,0.022460872500739838
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9765040,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9625164,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,383798,0.003551237588346052
"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9598343,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,18205,-0.003850094004198998
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9711359,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,405576,0.022380951027933624
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9654850,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Dimensions', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2019,455655,0.03529477766209335
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9669985,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,378758,0.04038251529632221
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown.

"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9676583,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,0.046243025313450724
"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9604827,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33104,0.04326311185124619
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9805996,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,129087,0.04498093221678591
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9736791,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,661398,0.019983449844016416
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9634046,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,327250,0.03193008162363176
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,0.024926931536695857
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice. We will test this system on multiple mouse models of auditory spectrum disorders to uncover novel covariation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes.",High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice,9743876,R21MH116450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'House mice', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linux', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Raspberries', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensory', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wild Animals', 'Work', 'animal model development', 'auditory processing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic behaviour', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'behavior test', 'flexibility', 'gene discovery', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2019,162891,-0.00022227603557133585
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9707897,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,641907,0.002320471081249609
"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,9803682,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,575750,-0.00424735735253523
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9749260,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,564964,0.020541839332612038
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation.

"Multi-region 'Network of Networks' Recurrent Neural Network Models of Adaptive and Maladaptive Learning The massive neural activity data collected through transformative new technologies present an incredible opportunity in facilitating the mission of the BRAIN Initiative and the wider neuroscience community: to understand brain function. However, the analysis and interpretation of these massive datasets represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuit ensembles. We propose to eliminate this bottleneck through the development of powerful new, scalable multi-region neural network models and analysis tools that will enable discovery of the connectivity and circuit mechanisms within and between brain regions. We will build off of the advantages of, and our prior successes with, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the state-of-the-art for modeling time-varying behaviors. Specifically, we propose to develop and test a new class of multi-region “network of networks” RNNs to model the nested, hierarchical computations occurring across multiple interacting brain regions during complex behavior. These models will provide another advantage over existing models in being trained to match experimental data from the outset, and using the dynamics of learning to reveal effective connectivity, comprising both network structures and communication principles. The entire pipeline—training and testing the multi-region models and analysis steps for real and simulated data—is scalable and modular, enabling our community of collaborators and end-users to reproduce, validate, and even customize it. Finally, the models, methods, and theories developed are aimed as extensible deliverables. They will lead to widely disseminable new extensions for probing the circuit mechanisms of inter-area communication during both functional and dysfunctional states, and bridging together several experimental observations and model systems. The specific aims of the project include a number of critical subprojects focused on: first, developing multi- region RNN models of adaptive learning, initially focusing on the use case of adversity evasion by zebrafish; and second, modeling circuit dysfunctions in maladaptive learning, the use case being learned immobility in the face of inescapable, persistent adversity. Third, in parallel, this project will scale up and expand the range of the multi-region models and tools for inferring effective connectivity to larger, yet less-sampled datasets, and disseminate them to a community of collaborative end-users. The proposed multi-region RNN models and analytical tools have the potential to be widely used in the neuroscience community to dissect features of brain function in both health and disease. Moreover, our resultant theoretical frameworks will have a strong influence on fundamental approaches to understanding neuroscience data and will inform experimental paradigms and drive future data collection. Transformative new technologies now capture neural activity from thousands of single neurons across multiple areas and even whole brains with sub-second resolution. These methods are critical facilitators for the BRAIN initiative and the wider neuroscience community. However, they produce large-scale datasets whose analysis and interpretation represent a bottleneck for computational models and theories, which traditionally simulate brain areas as modules in isolation, rather than as interacting, intercommunicating neural circuits. We will develop powerful new, scalable multi-region neural network models and analysis tools for eliminating this bottleneck, opening up new avenues for probing circuit mechanisms within and between brain regions in both health and disease.",Multi-region 'Network of Networks' Recurrent Neural Network Models of Adaptive and Maladaptive Learning,9775964,R01EB028166,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'adaptive learning', 'analytical tool', 'behavioral response', 'cohesion', 'coping', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'model development', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,879000,0.009331058188416846
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9673799,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2019,553859,0.01238550612819919
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9789318,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2019,7509,0.04176393525498089
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9653114,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2019,696730,-0.008648073971163447
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9743648,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'MRI Scans', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,-0.001679957562053428
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9605296,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2019,698908,0.03523445105890879
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9778913,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2019,3062362,0.03386105298889402
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings.

This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training).

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. Project Summary Synapses between neurons are plastic – able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an “error signal” that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers are other cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circuit uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorders, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: Raymond, Jennifer L. The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local “decisions” cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit’s function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.

"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,9991267,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248994,-0.006478957406620932
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,-0.0011198843449811678
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9797408,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,337875,-0.016470746069146905
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.",Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network,9754494,K99DA048748,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Drops', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visuospatial', 'Weight', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'deep neural network', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,159052,0.04844871894494646

An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9748637,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'post stroke', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,480336,0.009047208342265413
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9618883,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,720901,0.020464476160095838
"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,9872014,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2019,126090,0.03908914054128828
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,0.035600141596284204
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9761233,F32MH119797,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study models', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2019,60854,0.058099614013702575
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9775436,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,279706,0.04999976602467379
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior.

"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9713394,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2019,355558,0.0020915013796380245
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,0.01720430258788235
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9716629,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,233699,0.015232890004077263

Mark Richardson, MD, PhD, Department ofNeurologicaJ Surgery and Robert S. Turner, PhD, Department ofNeurobiology, University ofPittsburgh; Wolf-Julian Neumann, MD, and Andrea A. Kiihn, MD, Department ofNeurology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin. Co-Investigators: Benjamin Blankertz, PhD, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universitat Berlin; Tom Mitchell, PhD, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University. PROJECT DESCRIPTION 1 Introduction and Objectives  Deep brain stimulation (DBS) represents one of the major clinical breakthroughs in the age of translational neuroscience.1 In 1987, Benabid and colleagues demonstrated that high frequency stimulation can mimic the effects of ablative neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease (PD)2'3, while offering two key advantages to previous procedures: adjustability and reversibility. This project will employ artificial intelligence strategies, which have allowed for unprecedented innovations in translational, personalized, high-definition medicine4, to further elevate the therapeutic potential of DBS. By developing a computational framework for decoding behavioral and disease states from combined subthalamic and cortical population recordings, this work will inform future adaptive stimulation paradigms for PD and other movement disorders. The central aim is to develop a computational framework for deep learning- based multi-feature decoding of behavioral and disease states from electrocorticography (ECoG), in order to advance the evolution of aDBS. Proposed Research. The concurrent use ofresearch ECoG during DBS surgery recently has enabled basic neuroscience investigation ofhuman co11ical-subcortical network dynamics. The overall goal ofthis project is to establish intelligent algorithms to identify physiological and pathophysiological states in ECoG data that predict epochs during which stimulation would facilitate movement or reduce symptoms. Given that ECoG electrode strips can be implanted safely during DBS surge1y5·6, the use of ECoG for aDBS is hypothesized to have several advantages: 1. compatibility with any DBS electrode design; 2. optimal signal  to noise ratio, 3. customization of electrode implantation location, based on known network connectivity of the target nucleus; 4. potential implantation of multiple remote sensors in different brain regions. Several barriers, however, exi'st for advancing this type of strategy. Namely, neither instantaneous biomarkers, evidence for optimal recording locations, adaptive control algorithms, nor previous reports on the use of ECoG-based, adaptive DBS have been described in PD patients. These obstacles will be overcome through achieving the following: Objective #1: Identify cortical and subthalamic biomarkers that can distinguish activity related to physiological motor behaviorfrom that related to pathological symptoms. The goal of objective 1 is to distinguish oscillatory features in population activity based on the temporal, spectral and spatial specificity of their synchronization across the corticosubthalamic axis, e.g. characteristic evolution of beta activity with bradykinesia vs. rhythmic high frequency activity  synchronized during tremor. Features that reflect instantaneous motor behavior and parkinsonian symptom  severity will be characterized through spectral decomposition mapped to 3D reconstructions of recording locations.  Objective #2: Determi11e tlte optimal computational approaclt fol' real-time ,letection and prediction of physiological andpatliophysiological behaviors.  The goal of objective 2 is to use results from the first objective to build a computational framework for deep learning of physiological and pathophysiological states from cortical time-series data based on  hierarchical recurrent artificial neural networks.

"Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling Project Summary/Abstract  This project develops machine learning approaches that describe statistical systems in biology. By combining analytic results calculated from the exact probabilistic description of the system with machine learning inference, our new methods present exciting opportunities to model previously inaccessible complex dynamics. The resulting Boltzmann machine-like learning algorithms present a new class of modeling techniques based on the powerful in- ference of arti cial neural networks. Further development of this approach will bring the groundbreaking advances from the surge of recent interest in machine learning into the biological modeling eld. The mathematical methods we develop will be used to derive e cient algorithms for multiscale simulation, directly applicable to large scale biological modeling. In particular, the algorithms will be used to study the dynamics of stochastic biochemistry at synapses, with direct relevance to learning and memory formation in the brain. Current studies of these processes are limited by the long timescales involved and the highly spatially organized structures featured. In addition to leveraging the machine learning expertise we are developing, we also employ new electron microscopy datasets to produce 3D reconstructions of neural tissue with unprecedented accuracy. Consequentially, we will be able to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, as well as the biochemical basis of oscillatory behavior in networks of neurons that occurs during sleep. Furthermore, the interactions of these highly stochastic ion channels with electrical in neurons will be explored through groundbreaking hybrid simulation environments. The software that we will develop combines existing popular simulation tools into multiscale approaches, and will be distributed as a powerful tool to the broader biological modeling community. Its usage in further computational experiments can present a key advancement in the development of pharmaceuticals, allowing the direct study of the interactions of biochemistry and whole neuron electrophysiology without making limiting assumptions to sim- plify the simulations. This has promising implications for intervening in age-related learning de cits, as well as in neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. Finally, this proposal will bring together our existing multiscale modeling community, the National Center for Multi-scale Modeling of Biological Systems (MMBioS), with the MSM consortium. The interactions of these organizations and their communities of expert researchers will foster new collaborative work on exciting multiscale problems in biology, including applications of the machine learning frameworks and software we are developing. 1 Project Narrative  A wide variety of biological systems can be described statistically, from molecular biochemistry up to the network level activity of neurons. This work develops machine learning approaches to approximate these systems, enabling new simulation methods that bridge di erent levels of description. The resulting computational studies aim to shed light on the basis of learning and computation in the brain, and will enable the development of pharmaceutical targets for learning de cits associated with aging and neurological disorders such as Alzheimers. 1",Machine Learning for Generalized Multiscale Modeling,9791802,R56AG059602,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consequentialism', 'Coupling', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Neuropil', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Sleep', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'biological systems', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'computer studies', 'experimental study', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'mathematical methods', 'men who have sex with men', 'microscopic imaging', 'multi-scale modeling', 'nervous system disorder', 'particle', 'postsynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R56,2018,619053,0.014257323298656192
"Encoding Precise Behavioral Features of Anxiety by Cortico-BNST Ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Maladaptive behaviors are a staple of anxiety disorders, yet how specific neural populations drive these behav- iors is unclear. Despite the high prevalence of anxiety disorders and their devastating burden, truly effective therapeutics are still lacking; understanding the underlying pathophysiology is critical. This is not a trivial feat considering the multitude of regions involved and the complexity of associated behaviors. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is one region highly implicated in governing adaptive and pathological anxiety states, and medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) neurons are known to regulate motivated behaviors, including those re- lated to anxiety. How mPFC directly modulates BNST activity in anxiety states though is not known. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to study how mPFC neurons that project to BNST engage in anxiety-related behaviors. Experiments will employ contemporary tools to study the precise neurocircuitry during expression of specific anxiety-related phenotypes. First, in rodent models, anxiety-related behaviors will be identified in the presence of an anxiogenic stimulus using recently developed computer vision and machine learning tools that define behaviors from subsecond modules (Aim 1.1). This is a highly quantitative approach to analyze behavior that will track commonly studied behaviors and, importantly, novel behaviors that have been overlooked in the literature. Second, the role of BNST-projecting mPFC neurons in anxiety-related behaviors will be assessed using inhibitory and excitatory optogenetics in combination with the previously described behavioral analysis (Aim 1.2). This neural population will be targeted using new viral strategies that allow for projection specific targeting. Finally, the physiological neural dynamics of these mPFC neurons during the expression of anxiety- related behaviors will be visualized using mountable, miniature microscopes in mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s (Aim 2). This activity will be assessed with concurrent behavioral module recording to understand the neuronal dynamics during anxiety-related behaviors. Collectively, these experiments will determine how BNST-projecting mPFC neurons govern expression of the wide gamut of anxiety-related behaviors. Further, the culmination of this study and studies across the neuroscientific community will bear a clearer understanding of how anxiety-related behaviors arise in mental illnesses and will drive development of promising therapeutics. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is relevant to public health because understanding the neural pathways that contribute to anxiety- related behaviors will drive understanding of its etiology and development of more effective therapeutics.

"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9520535,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'learning strategy', 'limb movement', 'multimodality', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,549425,0.006816511620889911
"Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy Project Summary/Abstract: Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disease affecting 50 million people worldwide. While current management of epilepsy depends on continuous medication or invasive surgery, a deeper understanding of circuit-level pathology and an ability to predict seizures reliably will yield more focused therapeutic approaches. We will induce spontaneous unilateral focal seizures in rats by focal injection of kainic acid into the hippocampus. We will continuously record intracranial EEG, LFP, and video data from these rats for a period of 120 days. Relevant features will then be computed, including signal correlations, coherence, energy, entropies, and phase synchronization, as well as features detected by a sparse autoencoder. We will build train predictive classifiers using the first 90 days of data input to the following algorithms: (1) linear regression, (2) random forest, (3) support vector machines, and (4) neural networks. Performance will be assessed by ROC computed for the last 30 days of data. Next, we will apply single pulse electrical stimuli periodically to a new cohort of continuously monitored rats with unilateral hippocampal focal epilepsy. We will analyze the responses to this single pulse electrical stimulus on intracranial EEG and depth electrodes to determine whether seizures can be interrupted, predicted, then preempted by stimulus. Machine learning approaches coupled with active electrical stimulation will render algorithms that identify changes in the electrographic response to stimulus, which predict subsequent seizures with high sensitivity and specificity. We will leverage the fine spatiotemporal resolution offered by optogenetic techniques to study the nature of seizure initiation at the circuit level in a closed-loop system. We will probe the hippocampal circuit considered a generator in focal epilepsy: pyramidal neurons expressing CamK2a. To target each of these elements, we will induce expression of a halorhodopsin driven by the CamK2a promoter via a lentivirus delivered stereotactically to the hippocampal CA3. We will then stimulate the halorhodopsin with 589 nm light pulses, delivered during pre-ictal activity identified by the predictive algorithms and stimulus response. This closed-loop system will be uniquely informative by altering brain states preemptively rather than during the actual seizure as done in previous studies. Our study will ultimately offer new insights into the mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, and may help improve diagnostics and therapeutic approaches for patients suffering from focal epilepsy. Project Narrative: In a rat model of epilepsy, we will study the patterns of brain electrical activity in response to electrical stimulus, and how those patterns change in distinct brain states including: seizure, immediately before seizure, and between seizures. We will use statistical and computational approaches to predict seizures, and subsequently preempt the predicted seizures using stimulus that targets the seizure-generating circuit in the brain. The goal of this project is to understand the physiological mechanisms underlying seizure initiation, with an eye to therapeutic applications of seizure prediction.",Seizure Prediction in a Rodent Model of Focal Epilepsy,9600418,F31NS105161,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Focal Seizure', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Interruption', 'Kainic Acid', 'Label', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Rattus', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'brain electrical activity', 'cohort', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'preempt', 'promoter', 'response', 'spatiotemporal']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2018,37596,0.001825525435162973
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,120000,-0.02825858152899014
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9455790,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,377627,0.0027937610646763303
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9461541,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,218064,0.008805487013828904
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9616747,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2018,567754,0.013708700778815856
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function.

"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9533702,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,278688,0.036280323440795466
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9509569,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved functioning', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,375839,0.007807804744941897
"CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS: Neural Basis of Planning,9692133,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,429555,0.030492485205348585
"Toward Automated Spike Sorting via Ground Truth Neural Recordings PROJECT​ ​SUMMARY Scaling extracellular electrophysiology to higher channel counts is hindered by the burden of data handling,storage, and especially preprocessing, e.g. spike sorting ​[1]​. The burden of spike sorting can in principle be reduced through a combination of high-density multielectrode array (probe) technology and algorithm optimization to yield a spike sorting method that is both highly accurate and fully automated [2–4]​. With a known-good spike sorting method in hand, the algorithm can be baked into the data stream as early as possible to allow for automatic data sorting and a massive reduction in data rate to downstream storage and processing. However, it takes an investment of considerable resources to implement this sort of large-scale real-time processing, and great confidence to throw away raw data and keep​ ​only​ ​processed​ ​data. Accuracy and automation of spike sorting increases with the spatial density of recording sites ​[5–7]​. Neural activity recorded from high-density probes can serve as a data corpus for testing the accuracy of spike sorting algorithms. However, to quantify spike sorting performance for comparison between algorithms, the ground truth spiking activity of neurons captured in the data corpus must be measured, such as by simultaneously recording via patch-clamp pipette or some other recording modality ​[8–10]​. Unfortunately, because ground truth recordings are so challenging to perform, they remain too rare to allow for this sort of analysis in a large-scale, meaningful way ​[11]​. Until this need is met, spike sorting development lacks a compass, and cutting-edge techniques such as supervised machine learning which require large amounts of labelled data remain out-of-reach ​[12]​. ​Accordingly, we propose a series of multimodal neural recordings combining multielectrode array and patch pipette techniques to generate​ ​a​ ​corpus​ ​of​ ​ground​ ​truth​ ​data​ ​for​ ​validation​ ​of​ ​spike​ ​sorting​ ​algorithms.

"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9576061,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,359433,0.013162102111123588
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9345313,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.03725139063852757
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the gap Recent advances in experimental technology promise rapid progress in developing a mechanistic understanding of how neural circuit structure, at the synaptic scale, leads to complex sensory, cognitive, and motor behaviors. Volume EM techniques have advanced to the point that neural tissue can be imaged at synaptic resolution in volumes large enough (~ 100 µm) to contain a entire small neuron . Innovations in machine learning approaches to analyzing these EM images have now permitted automated segmentation of these into 3D representations of every neuronal process within the volume. However, significant technical challenges remain to improve EM acquisition and analysis methods to the point of achieving the millimeter-scale volumes required to reconstruct neuronal assemblies underlying complex behaviors. Tools are needed to improve the reliability of EM systems for the acquisition of such large datasets. Automated methods to identify the cell-type of segmented neurites and to characterize the firing patterns of neurons prior to EM imaging are also needed, as are software tools to query and visualize the resulting rich 3D datasets—essentially allowing neuroscientists to carry out ‘virtual experiments.’ Here we propose to develop a set of tools to address each of these problems. These tools will be developed in the context of the songbird, a powerful model organism to study the neural circuits underlying the production and learning of a complex vocal/motor behavior. Neural recordings in singing birds of every known cell type in cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia circuits, have led to mechanistic circuit-level hypotheses, which in turn make clear and testable predictions about the ultrastructure of neural circuits. The proposed tools would allow neuroscientists to bridge the gap from vEM data to the virtuous circle of hypothesis driven anatomical experimentation, and data-inspired hypotheses. Our proposal describes three Specific Aims directed toward these goals: · Aim 1: Develop tools to acq uire and to automatically segment millimeter-scale EM data sets · Aim 2: Develop tools to densely identify cell-types of segmented neurites using ultrastructural fingerprints · Aim 3: Develop and test a platform for virtual experimentation in segmented and annotated EM datasets PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this BRAIN Initiative project is to develop tools and resources that will facilitate the detailed analysis of brain microconnectivity. We will develop new approaches and optimize existing techniques to facilitate this important new approach to understanding the basic circuitry and computations underlying brain function. The connectomic tools we develop will be of interest to, and will be made accessible to, the broader scientific community; such tools, and the detailed annotated structural datasets they enable, will facilitate the study of neurobiological mechanisms of brain disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and Huntington’s disease.",From Electron Microscopy to Neural Circuit Hypotheses: Bridging the Gap,9609873,RF1MH117809,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biophysics', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Distant', 'Dorsal', 'Dreams', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Equipment', 'Fees', 'Fingerprint', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Huntington Disease', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'LOC118430 gene', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Production', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Software Tools', 'Songbirds', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning network', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,RF1,2018,70863,0.031104594846826625
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM).

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9471432,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,385524,0.008164269437595595
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9492704,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'trauma exposure', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,423903,-0.019738903669017996
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9536330,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,407497,-0.004301843234872809
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.004234543191684692
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9487337,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,236692,0.05773805908998186
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9526901,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'data warehouse', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2018,281216,0.013591279494537088
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9411095,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2018,699626,-0.008648073971163447
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9432559,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,729487,-0.0017817725694779403
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need.

"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9488537,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,446302,0.02030207296254601
"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",9615324,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,21379,0.0006357710710929324
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9551101,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2018,1528951,0.04337301802622412
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9608179,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.                ",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9380291,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58002,-0.003850094004198998
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks. n/a",CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses,9518011,R01NS100050,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'computer framework', 'conditioning', 'driving force', 'dynamic system', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pressure', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,297172,0.051461056352934784
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,9449472,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'source localization', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,378758,0.04038251529632221
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,0.019983449844016416
"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9408628,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,327250,0.03193008162363176
"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.)

"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9408441,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38516,0.04326311185124619
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9572441,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,386750,0.05530468746817703
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,9615336,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2018,21194,0.04176393525498089
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9534670,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2018,423985,0.015400952020374769
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice.

"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9504668,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,727051,0.002320471081249609
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9520422,R21MH114166,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Communication', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'behavioral study', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'men', 'neural model', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'physical property', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'sex', 'social', 'social skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2018,202112,-0.020413850935366164
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,0.04146903398425665
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9527977,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,208699,0.015232890004077263
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9506818,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,455418,0.029774514386545717
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9518000,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2018,570779,0.01238550612819919
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,0.03523445105890879
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9568829,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2018,3072362,0.03386105298889402
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training).

"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9546689,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,332220,0.02341832927854902
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9538277,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,477795,0.009047208342265413
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9692121,R01DA047869,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,254642,0.04999976602467379
"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9622419,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2018,386013,-0.005691274890621449
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology No abstract available Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions.

"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,0.02107043064135155
"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders. This work on the fundamental nature of the neural code will contribute to the body of knowledge required to create effective brain interfaces for motor and sensory prostheses with the potential to reduce sensory disabilities, provide treatments for cognitive disorders, and aid in recovery from central nervous system trauma.",Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations,9598640,K99EY028612,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Population Statistics', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Disorders', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual Cortex', 'Washington', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'clay', 'computational neuroscience', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'millisecond', 'neural model', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory prosthesis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'visual processing']",NEI,ALLEN INSTITUTE,K99,2018,132984,0.008962620032936242

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9238947,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,777587,0.020464476160095838

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9502398,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,341250,0.036200201050255974
"2019 Dendrites: Molecules, Structure and Function Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary Dendrites play a central role in neuronal computation by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate the output of the neuron in the form of action potentials. Recent advances in molecular, electrophysiological and imaging techniques have led to a rapid enhancement in our understanding of the mechanisms that shape dendritic structure, function and connectivity and the contribution of dendritic computation to behavior. Computational and theoretical approaches have further refined our views of dendrites and their unique role in brain function. Notably, dendrite structure and function may undergo plastic changes that contribute to nervous system development and learning, and dysfunction in these mechanisms can lead to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. The 2019 Gordon Research Conference and Seminar on Dendrites will bring together researchers whose latest findings help clarify how the properties of dendrites enable them to perform complex computations important for sensory-motor processing and higher cognitive function.The goal of this meeting is to exchange knowledge at the frontiers of dendrite research and strengthen communication among researchers from numerous disciplines who investigate dendrites. Project Narrative Neuronal dendrites receive and integrate inputs from other neurons to regulate the information flow through neural circuits. This Gordon Research Conference and Seminar will convene scientists of all levels and from diverse fields of neuroscience to present and discuss cutting-edge research on dendrite structure and function in health and disease.

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems.

"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,0.009980449017682132
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9245696,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,318064,0.008805487013828904
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9319333,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,278688,0.036280323440795466
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects.

"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9244854,R01NS063399,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incentives', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2017,30367,0.0027937610646763303
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species.

"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM).

"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9247017,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2017,190000,0.018570773188745872
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9318580,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382414,0.008164269437595595
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9281088,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,435678,-0.019738903669017996
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9301514,R01DC015138,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'online resource', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2017,293470,0.013591279494537088
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9275028,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,241790,0.05773805908998186
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment.

Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9238054,R01DC011805,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,360556,-0.008648073971163447
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9301669,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,709268,-0.0017817725694779403
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9311535,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,580007,0.013617355792711719
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9279262,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Form Perception', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Unconscious State', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,446302,0.02030207296254601
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9356342,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2017,1528951,0.04337301802622412
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation.

But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9247804,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Injectable', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,418329,0.042712051166255774
"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue. The tool developed will enable new experiments in mapping and understanding how neurons work together for functional behavior in the cortex of the brain.",Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking,9360616,R21EY027597,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Records Controls', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'awake', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'experimental study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'light emission', 'light scattering', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2017,196420,0.020216716889471405
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders. This project will develop an integrated approach to studying the mechanisms of timed motor behavior by combining large-scale neural recordings from multiple brain areas and computational modeling of neural networks. n/a",CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses,9306222,R01NS100050,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Rewards', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'computer framework', 'conditioning', 'driving force', 'dynamic system', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'millisecond', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,297289,0.051461056352934784

"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network (Administrative Supplement) Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments.

"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9450709,R01NS104892,"['Accelerometer', 'Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Recurrence', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Squid', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'feeding', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,386750,0.05530468746817703
"Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks. Despite the high prevalence of epilepsy, which affects nearly 4% of the population over their lifetime, roughly one third of afflicted patients are incompletely responsive to anticonvulsant drugs, requiring in severe cases neurosurgical resections or novel approaches such as deep-brain stimulation (DBS). Recently, I helped develop an electrophysiology-based online DBS protocol for seizure detection and interruption in rodent models of absence epilepsy, a form of epilepsy involving aberrant thalamocortical activity. However, like other online DBS procedures which detect seizures as they occur, there was little ability to predict incipient seizures due in large part to limited spatiotemporal resolution of the signal we used, the electrocorticogram (ECoG). ECoG and related electroencephalogram (EEG), being large scale local field potential approaches, do not provide single-cell resolution of neural dynamics that are likely required to obtain predictive information. Over the last decade, the field of brain-machine interface (BMI) has made breakthroughs in neuroscience and engineering by developing methods for multi-electrode array recording of large scale neural spiking activity and efficient reduction of the resultant high-dimensional neural activity to a smaller number of dimensions to effectively control neural prostheses. We predict that this approach will be invaluable for understanding neural dynamics during seizures and stimulation, and for developing predictive algorithms and adaptive DBS protocols.  Therefore, the goal of this project is to precisely characterize thalamocortical neural activity during spontaneous absence seizures and following thalamic stimulation by combining large-scale thalamic and cortical neural recordings, optogenetics, and BMI mathematical techniques. Additionally, the experiments presented in this proposal will use the recorded neural activity to develop adaptive algorithms that both predict oncoming seizure activity and modify stimulation parameters based on the neural state and response to stimulation in real-time. This proposal is aimed towards increasing our understanding of the neural dynamics of epileptic networks and improving the efficacy and safety of online DBS. Roughly one third of epileptic patients are resistant to pharmacological treatment, which has promoted the development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a means to detect and prevent seizures. However, the neural activity underlying epileptic discharges and the effects of DBS on this activity are poorly understood, partially due to the limited information carried by the EEG signals used for monitoring seizures. A more precise characterization of epileptic neural circuits is crucial to improve current DBS design and enhance the sensitivity and efficacy of seizure detection and disruption, which demands the tools and resources of basic research.",Exploring thalamocortical neural state space for adaptive closed-loop deep brain stimulation of epileptic networks.,9257233,F31NS100265,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Generalized seizures', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'markov model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuroregulation', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.04326311185124619
"Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform Project Summary/Abstract A fundamental goal in neuroscience is to understand how information is processed in neuronal circuits. Ultimately, we would like to understand the relationship between circuit structure and network function. However, the immense complexity of most brain networks has been a significant barrier to progress. Neurons are a primary computational component of networks in the brain, yet we do not have a comprehensive list of their types for even the simplest mammalian neuronal circuit. Moreover, a neuron’s function is fundamentally dependent on how it is connected within its network, yet mammalian neuronal networks consist of billions of cells with trillions of connections. How can we get a handle on such a complex computational machine? Recent advances in large-scale electron microscopy (EM) and molecular genetic tools have allowed us to begin detailed mapping of neural network anatomy and cellular physiology. The cerebellum is an excellent system to validate our novel platform as part of a systematic effort to reverse engineer a functional neural circuit that is involved in motor control and social behavior. Its basic structure is well ordered, relatively simple and sufficiently described to have inspired computational models that capture aspects of cerebellar function. However, even the most advanced models are limited by an incomplete characterization of the cell types and connectivity within the cerebellum. Here, we propose to validate our next-generation large-scale EM platform and provide a comprehensive characterization of cerebellar circuitry. We will use tools recently developed in our lab to a circuit that offers the advantages of relative simplicity and a strong starting foundation. These studies will allow us to understand principles of cerebellar circuit organization and may help us determine the role of specific circuit elements in neurodegenerative disorders. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to understand the organizational principles underlying cerebellar circuits. We will use large-scale electron microscopy to extract cerebellar network anatomy. Understanding rules underlying cell type-specific neuronal connectivity may help to reveal how the brain is altered in neurodegenerative disorders, specific cell types that are affected, and guide effective treatment strategies.",Cerebellar network mapping with a high-throughput TEM platform,9379329,RF1MH114047,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Count', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cerebellar Diseases', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Set', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Peroxidases', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Validation', 'ascorbate', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'imaging approach', 'information processing', 'insight', 'interest', 'motor control', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'next generation', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'serial imaging', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,RF1,2017,1271250,0.00849783356147297
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9360109,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeleton', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'vector', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2017,425138,0.015400952020374769
"Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain Summary/Abstract:  Auditory emotion recognition (AER) is the process of extracting emotional content out of the acoustic features of speech, and is disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders including autism and schizophrenia. Both the encoding of this information in the auditory cortex as well as the knowledge of which brain areas participate in the circuit that underlies AER are not known. With a unique access to invasive intracranial neurophysiology in awake, behaving humans, we propose to study the neural basis of AER in patients undergoing invasive electrode monitoring as part of staged epilepsy surgery protocols. These subjects will perform an AER task while brain responses are recorded in an effort to decipher the neural processes that identify emotion and while specific areas of their brain are stimulated in order to causally link focal activation of AER circuit components to perception.  In Aim 1, we will identify the neuronal mechanisms underlying emotion recognition using a task that breaks down AER into three sequential steps: encoding, integration and judgment. First, we will identify the encoding of emotionally relevant acoustic cues by examining how sensory features such as pitch, intensity and modulation are encoded by neuronal responses in the auditory cortex and other brain areas involved in emotional processing such as the amygdala, insula and prefrontal cortex. Second, we will examine how these acoustic cues are integrated into an emergent emotional percept by measuring activity in putative areas as well as the interaction among these areas after relevant sensory input while subjects consider possible responses. Finally, we will examine the subjects’ response to the AER task and correlate the judgment of emotion with the extent to which it can be predicted by neuronal activity in different brain regions of interest. While most analyses will focus on intraindividual data, differences in brain activity as it relates to AER will be compared in males versus females in order to examine biological differences in AER between sexes. In aim 2, we will determine the effect of neural stimulation on AER. We will apply focal single pulse stimulation to brain areas at those critical time windows identified in aim 1 in order to bias emotional decisions. This type of stimulation results in very focal and temporally restricted disruption of function and can be used to determine a brain area’s causal role in perception.  We seek to build a detailed neurobiological model of the AER. This would be a precursor to designing individualized therapeutic approaches to treat deficits in auditory emotional processing as well as identifying putative targets to treat affective disorders in general. Narrative: Identifying emotion in speech is a critical brain process required for social interaction and is impaired in many neuropsychiatric diseases. We will study how the brain codes the emotional content of speech and how stimulating specific brain areas can potentially improve this process. !",Neurophysiology of auditory emotion recognition in the human brain,9373513,R21MH114166,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Personal Communication', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Pathologist', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'awake', 'behavioral study', 'computer studies', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'men', 'neural model', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'physical property', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'sex', 'social', 'social skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R21,2017,253863,-0.020413850935366164
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9277595,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,825202,0.002320471081249609
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9308020,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,492125,0.020541839332612038
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9354513,R01MH069456,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,455418,0.029774514386545717
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9402502,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'connectome', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2017,581182,0.01238550612819919
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,0.008238689658653847
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9327009,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2017,242522,0.028669768327379812
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9444124,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2017,3087282,0.03386105298889402
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9360116,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Impulsivity', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Periodicity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2017,332220,0.02341832927854902
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9324362,R01NS072406,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plasticizers', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of purkinje fibers', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'paired stimuli', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus', 'visual-vestibular']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,479269,0.009047208342265413
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,0.02107043064135155
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,9618453,R01NS063399,[' '],NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,273292,0.0027937610646763303
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9284528,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,341250,0.036200201050255974
"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9126614,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,384420,0.026077908446115756
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,0.009980449017682132
"A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and Type 2 diabetes have skyrocketed to epidemic proportions in American children and adults. To prevent the onset, initiate the reversal, and avoid the relapse of obesity, we must first identify the neural underpinnings of unhealthy eating choices and habits. The immediate goals of this innovative proposal are to decipher the neural code predicting compulsive overconsumption of sugar and to develop new approaches, algorithms, and technologies to detect neural signals of craving in real-time to avert maladaptive behaviors with unprecedented precision. Specifically, the project outline will begin by identifying neural circuits mediating compulsive sucrose seeking. Next, we will record neural activity using in vivo electrophysiology and fluorescence microendoscopy of GCaMP5-expressing cells to collect precise, first-order, raw features with high signal-to-noise ratio during cue-induced reinstatement and compulsion behavioral assays with their time-locked neural correlates allows for the identification of craving states. Then, we will use machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine classification of neural activity allows for a Bayesian hidden Markov model for a transition diagram between states in craving-compulsion-consumption behavioral chains. Following identification of neural activity signaling ""craving"" states (operationally defind as the behavioral state immediately preceding compulsive reward-seeking), real-time state detection will be used to trigger precise optogenetic inhibition of compulsive sucrose-seeking. A successful outcome of this research would establish a new paradigm for the treatment for obesity, focusing on reprogramming the neural circuit perturbations that cause obesity, as opposed to treating the physical consequences of a neural circuit imbalance - an approach that could also be applied to other neuropsychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  This proposal is ideally suited for the New Innovator Award for the following reasons: First, the ultimate goal of this research is to lay the foundation for translating Neural Circuit Reprogramming to human patients. Second, the proposal is focused on technology development, delivering new technologies that will enable not state-identification and dynamic triggering used for Neural Circuit Reprogramming, and serve as springboards for other fields. Third, this proposal heavily leverages my unique background in sucrose-self administration, relapse, optogenetics, electrophysiology and imaging, but is technically and conceptually distinct from my lab's other studies on acute perturbations that affect anxiety, depression and addiction. As a new faculty member at MIT, I am poised at the nexus of science, engineering, computation and technology and am equipped with the precise skill set and expertise to execute this high-risk, yet potentially revolutionary project. n/a",A Novel Strategy for Combating Obesity: Reprogramming Neural Circuits,9284928,DP2DK102256,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Noise', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patients', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Science', 'Self Administration', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sucrose', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'addiction', 'combat', 'compulsion', 'craving', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sugar', 'technology development']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,DP2,2016,2560,-0.012075218854107209
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,9107487,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,230351,-0.001589568874132632
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research program will establish new framework for understanding the cognitive neuroscience architecture of scene perception, with the aim of unraveling how the human brain analyzes the geometry and functionality of visual environment in order to guide our actions and navigation in the world.            ",Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene,9006938,R01EY026042,"['4 year old', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Confusion', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Floor', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Parahippocampal Gyrus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visuospatial', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'vector']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,366529,0.008805487013828904
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9132359,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2016,278688,0.036280323440795466
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9136881,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'learning strategy', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,352019,0.007807804744941897
"Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Modelling Rett Syndrome in Vascularized Neural Assemblies,9266143,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2016,153000,0.016989491714164567

"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,9089992,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2016,167410,0.0593711088119509
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8996729,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2016,308040,0.0027937610646763303
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9185649,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'cell type', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,350000,0.02401700112818481
"Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology.  As a result, treatments for humans are often developed based on animal addiction models.  However, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  Some researchers suggest that the gap in translating pre-clinical to clinical models stems from untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive substrates on the modeled tasks.  Therefore, there is a need for research than can verify that animal and human decision-making systems are comparable, which in turn, could improve the generalizability of results across these research stages.  Effective translational paradigms are needed to test similarities (or differences) in cognitive processes across species.  The present proposal introduces a novel experiential foraging paradigm for humans, which was designed based on a go/no-go foraging paradigm for rats (Restaurant Row).  In the Restaurant Row paradigm, an animal has a fixed amount of time to traverse a circular track collecting food rewards after variable delay times from different ""restaurants."" This paradigm successfully captured individual differences in preference, as well as behavioral and neural signatures of emotional constructs (e.g.  regret, disappointment).  In the proposed human variant (called the Web-Surf task), humans make a series of go/no-go decisions as they travel between video galleries that present different types of video clips after variable delays.  The human variant was designed to mimic the rat variant while also considering natural human ethology.  Preliminary analyses in human subjects suggest the two paradigms capture similar behavioral mechanisms.  The first aim of the proposed project is to examine whether the Web- Surf task equivalently measures emotional constructs, such as regret.  The first aim also seeks to elucidate whether individual differences in behavioral task performance map onto variations in impulsive traits.  The second aim of the proposed project is to determine whether the Web-Surf task captures neural signatures of deliberation and emotional processing as seen in rats.  This will be accomplished using general linear modeling and machine learning approaches for processing functional neuroimaging data.  This task could be pivotal in reducing the gap between pre-clinical and clinical research, and more importantly, advancing the development of addiction treatments for humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology; however, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  This division may be, in part, due to untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive systems in the compared tasks.  The novel research outlined in this proposal will help improve the translation between human and nonhuman animal models, and in turn, improve treatment efficacy for these disorders.                ",Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making,9185215,F31DA040335,"['Accounting', 'Advanced Development', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ethology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Food', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regrets', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stem', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'willingness']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2016,36927,0.02063594305127941
"Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission Project Summary  Bipolar disorder is characterized by variability in mood symptoms and cognitive impairment which leads to functional impairment both during depression and even during periods of remission. A major clinical challenge is that patients exhibit substantial variability in treatment response despite having the same clinical diagnosis, which suggests heterogeneity in underlying neurobiological dysfunction. In this R03, our aims are to deﬁne speciﬁc frontal- cingulate cognitive control and amygdala-frontal emotion regulatory neural clusters in brain activation and connectivity using dimensional tasks of cognitive control and acute threat. We will also develop neurocognitive and emotional proﬁles of the neural clusters we identify.  To accomplish our aims, we will analyze an existing dataset of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans, obtained in previous NIMH studies at the UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program, from bipolar disorder subjects (65 remitted and 21 depressed) and 65 healthy controls. We will use a novel approach, called Dimensional Neural Clustering, to classify fMRI data. Our approach is based on techniques used in other serious illnesses with multiply- determined outcomes, such as breast cancer, that have revolutionized treatment by identifying subgroups and made invaluable life-saving contributions. After computing brain activation and connectivity associated with the neural circuits underlying cognitive control (activated by response inhibition) and acute threat (activated by emotion regulation), we will use Dimensional Neural Clustering to identify subgroups of patients. Dimensional Neural Clustering differs from previous machine-learning approaches because we will use neurobiology to deﬁne subgroups of patients, rather than to classify patients based on a clinical diagnosis.  We hypothesize that patients can be classiﬁed based on inhibitory and regulatory neural clusters. Moreover, the neural clusters will be associated with differential phenotypic expression characterized by neurocognitive performance, mood/anxiety symptoms, and the ability to reappraise/suppress emotion. Our demonstration of neural subtypes of bipolar disorder will provide a basis for a neurobiologically-driven approach to understanding bipolar disorder, on which we can elaborate in future dimensional work. Our ﬁndings will provide a foundation for future work to personalize treatment. People diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience different disease symptoms and have varied responses to treatments for depressive episodes. Such variability within patients who have the same clinical diagnosis suggests signiﬁcant underlying neural heterogeneity that is not captured by current diagnostic criteria. We will implement a novel approach that uses functional neuroimaging data to generate a neurobiologically-driven classiﬁcation of people with bipolar disorder to guide future work in personalizing treatment.",Neural Signatures of Bipolar Disorder across Depression and Remission,9169470,R03MH110877,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Bipolar I', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Down-Regulation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Lead', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'depressive symptoms', 'disease phenotype', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mood symptom', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'statistics', 'success', 'sugar', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,77000,0.008818763164196802
"The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states Abstract  In the last decade it has become increasingly apparent that epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression play an important role in brain function and dysfunction. Disruption in neuroepigenetic developmental processes such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation result in mental retardation and cognitive impairments. More recently, neuroepigenetic processes have also been implicated in adult behaviors, such as addiction and memory. This opens the possibility that these mechanisms may be able to control the establishment and maintenance of behavioral states. However, the underlying mechanisms through which neuroepigenetic processes can mediate changes in circuit excitability to determine behavioral states remain mysterious. Moreover, because of the complexity and heterogeneity of the mammalian brain, we have no knowledge about the genetic loci of integration between the environment and behavior, and the identity of the neural pathways that control them in specific circuits. This presents a major roadblock towards unlocking the interface between brain and environment and their role in human health and disease. Here we propose a three-prong solution to this problem by using: a brain that shows conserved neurochemistry and neuroepigenetic mechanisms, but with orders of magnitude fewer neurons and homogenous circuits compared to mammalian brains, behaviors that are regulated by the environment (hunger and satiety), and an environment that is experimentally controllable (fasting vs. re-feeding; normal diet vs. high sugar diet). Changes in the excitability and plasticity of conserved circuits determine outputs feeding states like hunger and satiety. These changes occur slow, are persistent over hours, depend on the physiological state and are bidirectional. Thus, they could be encoded neuroepigenetically to alter the expression of key genes important to modulate circuit excitability. Furthermore, because a large number of metabolism intermediates functions as cofactors for chromatin modifying enzymes, physiological changes in metabolites and nutrients can directly alter gene expression. My lab has pioneered techniques and established unique collaborations to address the functional role of neuroepigenetic processes in regulating the activity of specific circuits in the context of feeding states. We propose to map how environmental inputs act on chromatin and gene expression to direct the changes in neuronal excitability that underlie output feeding behaviors. First, we will identify the specific chromatin pathways that act in a unique circuit important to switch the behavioral state of the fly between hungry and sated. We will then map the functional genetic loci of integration between physiological state and output behavioral states by examining the occupancy of these pathways on chromatin and their effect on behavior and neural activity. We will then dissect how changes in environmental input (energy scarcity in fasting, energy availability in re-feeding, and energy surplus in a high sugar diet) directly affect gene expression by altering the activity of these pathways and their genetic loci of integration. To this end, we will work with analytical chemists to develop new methods to measure changes in metabolites in the blood, brain and specific circuits and with computational biologists to harness machine learning analysis to integrate metabolism and gene expression datasets to identify the molecular pathways that act at the interface between input and effector mechanisms to regulate output behavioral states. Because the endocrine and physiological changes that underlie hunger and satiety are evolutionary conserved, our approach will provide a model of how the environment can functionally determine bidirectional, flip-flop behavioral states through neuroepigenetic mechanisms. More broadly, these studies will uncover how epigenetic mechanisms may function as gatekeepers of “behavioral states” (normal and abnormal), to provide the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying the “conditioning” effect of environments (from nutrients to maternal care) on neural plasticity. Public Health Relevance Statement: The proposed study will identify how nutrients in diet play a key role in regulating hunger and satiety states by changing neuronal activity and behavior. This will pave the way to understanding how the increased consumption of calories is linked to diseases such as depression, cancer, aging and neurodegeneration. More broadly, these experiments will identify in detail the molecular and physiological adaptations of a cellular system to a changing environment, develop new methodologies to study metabolism, and computational tool to integrate large orthogonal gene expression and metabolism datasets.",The role of neuroepigenetics in bidirectional behavioral states,9167992,DP2DK113750,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Consumption', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data Set', 'Developmental Process', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fasting', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Functional disorder', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histone Acetylation', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hunger', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Retardation', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Nutrient', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Adaptation', 'Play', 'Process', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'addiction', 'brain behavior', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'conditioning', 'feeding', 'fly', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'neurochemistry', 'neuronal excitability', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sugar']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,DP2,2016,2009885,-0.009087304568899458
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), depression and functional impairment. The overarching goal of the study is to use a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm of fear overgeneralization, skin conductance response (SCR), and machine learning analytic methods in order to identify a neural signature of trauma-related psychopathology that can serve as an objective measure of pathology and functional impairment, and a novel target for neuroscience informed treatments of functionally impaired trauma exposed populations.",Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults,9096246,R01MH105355,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Generalized Anxiety Disorder', 'Goals', 'Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Panic Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SF-36', 'Safety', 'Secondary to', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Veterans', 'War', 'Work', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'assault', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain circuitry', 'conditioned fear', 'design', 'disaster survivor', 'endophenotype', 'falls', 'functional disability', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'social anxiety', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,399327,-0.019738903669017996
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9090040,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Internships', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online repository', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2016,293470,0.013591279494537088
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,9099855,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'support network', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,368557,0.015284499244719986
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,0.008164269437595595
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9130265,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246990,0.05773805908998186
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.        ",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9112119,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2016,228000,0.018570773188745872
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.        ",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9128362,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,827432,-0.0017817725694779403
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",9120413,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'disabling symptom', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'learning strategy', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,446302,0.02030207296254601

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9070769,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Health', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,418411,0.042712051166255774
"Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans ABSTRACT In the course of a day we naturally make multiple shifts in our overall cognitive state and in our aims and intents. We go from sleep to awake, from internal dialogue to external communication, from relative immobility to planned complex movements. The neural activity which distinguishes these different high-level states is unknown and yet is a fundamental aspect to understanding overall cognitive processes. It is also a baseline substrate that is adversely impacted by a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases. Our understanding of human cortical neurophysiology is almost entirely based on cognitive processes examined within the constraints of experimentally controlled tasks with time-locked, stimulus-driven behaviors. However, brain activity is fluid and continuous; much of our essential cognitive activity is not externally triggered but internally generated. The overarching goal of this research is to create platforms which allow for continuous acquisition of high-fidelity neural ensemble activity synchronized with behavioral data and contextual information to allow investigations into volitional changes in focus and intent. Data will be acquired from two groups of patients: those undergoing intracranial exploration for treatment of their epilepsy and patients implanted with multi- electrode arrays as part of the BrainGate clinical trial to restore communication and mobility to people with paralysis. Using this novel paradigm for investigation, we will explore the neural basis for changes in state which are dominated by receptive activities, internal thought and external interaction. We initially focus on motor behavior with a traditional task construction constraining the participant to watch, imagine and then attempt or actually move. We expand this to spontaneous activity in Aim 2. Finally, we move toward more general and abstracted investigations of volitional state by looking at an analogous task and spontaneous behavior with respect to language and communication (Aim 3). At each stage we will employ spectral, functional connectivity and data mining techniques to understand the neural underpinnings of these different states as well as the temporal dynamics that portend changes in state. Supporting all of these aims will be improvements and expansions in state-of-the-art human micro- and mesoscale neural recording environments to enable the study of continuous, real-time neural activity underlying state changes. Across aims we will explore the extent to which motor cortex alone contains the information which may be present in more widespread and higher order cortical regions. Our hypothesis is that motor cortex, does in fact, encode significant information about state in ways which encapsulate or summarize the information available in more wide spread regions. Most importantly, the questions inherent in this research are key to understanding human thought patterns at a fundamental level. This understanding has important implications not just for basic cognitive neuroscience but for our understanding of the processes which are altered in a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as epilepsy, the dementias, depression, and psychosis. The results of these studies are also essential for the practical instantiation of effective brain-machine interfaces which would allow patients to act autonomously. Narrative: From simple decisions to more significant and complex thoughts, we constantly shift our aims and intentions and the degree to which we are interacting externally or internally. Understanding these shifts is key to the development of truly autonomous brain-computer interfaces and neuroprosthetics as well as to understanding how these kinds of alterations can be compromised in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric diseases. In this project we go beyond routine cognitive studies based on constrained stimulus response designs and instead utilize continuous recordings of neural activity during spontaneous behavior to decode changes in volitional state during motor activity and communication.",Understanding the Neural Basis of Volitional State through Continuous Recordings in Humans,9205859,U01NS098968,"['Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Microelectrodes', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sleep', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Volition', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'awake', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'data mining', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2016,1443240,0.04337301802622412
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking SUMMARY: Understanding the mechanisms by which the living brain derives perception, cognition and behavior requires the ability to record and control electrical activity in many neurons simultaneously. Completely reconstructing the pattern of neural activity that mediates a specific neural operation is critical for fully understanding its underlying mechanism. This requires an approach that can measure neural activity on a large scale with high spatial and temporal resolution. Functional imaging of genetically encoded activity sensors is one of the most promising avenues towards achieving this goal because it permits dense sampling and unambiguous separation of nearby neurons1, 2. However, even techniques currently available cannot capture neural activity in large volumes of the brain simultaneously, at high speed, and with cellular resolution. Furthermore, these existing approaches rely on expensive and sophisticated hardware, and cannot be readily adapted for imaging in unrestrained animals. Since a central goal of the BRAIN initiative is to achieve large-scale recording of neural activity in behaving animals, a new imaging approach is needed to overcome these technical challenges.  To achieve high speed, volumetric imaging in a compact and inexpensive device, we propose to develop a new imaging modality - compressive four-dimensional (4D) light field microscopy (LFM). In this approach, we will combine the advantages of light field microscopy with compressed sensing to extract the activity of thousands of individual neurons with high spatial and temporal resolution, through scattering tissue. In conventional microscopy, the photo-detector only samples the intensity of photons. In LFM, the sensor also captures the angle of the light. This allows 3D reconstruction, since position and angle enable back-tracing of rays of light. Such a scheme can be achieved simply by placing a lenslet array in the imaging pathway (Fig. 1A). The resulting 4D light field gives complete volumetric data at each time frame3-6. 3D activity can thus be sampled at camera-limited frame rates, much faster than conventional methods such as multiphoton or light sheet microscopy. For these reasons, LFM for functional brain imaging could revolutionize experimental neuroscience.  Unfortunately, imaging methods which operate in the one-photon regime suffer from light scattering. To image activity in the mammalian brain, we must consider the effects of tissue scattering through the 3D volume. We propose to apply a new approach to processing light field data for better reconstructions of neurons through scattering media37,38. Since the effect of scattering is to spread the angles of propagation of light, measuring angle information inherently helps to characterize and mitigate scatter effects. Our method leverages compressed sensing algorithms, which exploit the sparsity of the light emission in 3D space and time. Importantly, the volume and resolution limits of our method are not set by the number of pixels captured, but rather by the number of active neurons at any given time. Thus, we will be able to localize and measure the activity of thousands or millions of individually active neurons in large volumes of cerebral cortical tissue. Project Narrative This project will develop new optical imaging techniques for real-time neural activity tracking across large volumes of scattering brain tissue. The tool developed will enable new experiments in mapping and understanding how neurons work together for functional behavior in the cortex of the brain.",Compressive Light Field microscopy for optogenetic neural activity tracking,9244514,R21EY027597,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Electrodes', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Records Controls', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensory', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'awake', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'in vivo', 'light emission', 'light scattering', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2016,197497,0.020216716889471405
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,9065984,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,400000,0.012677798883799779
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,9109046,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'connectome', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2016,313000,0.0314401931582796
"""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data"" Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry—the individual neuron—continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called “persistence summaries” will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease. Narrative. The complex tree shapes of neurons are important for their role in neuronal circuitry but are mathematically challenging to characterize and analyze. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have recently made their way from pure mathematics to applications, will be brought to bear on neuronal structure and dynamics by a highly collaborative team combining the necessary expertise. The resulting tools will be made available to neuroscientists studying normal and diseased brain circuitry.","""Methods from Computational Topology and Geometry for Analysing Neuronal Tree and Graph Data""",9170501,R01EB022899,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Formulation', 'Geometry', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imagination', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Morphology', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Travel', 'Trees', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'interest', 'light microscopy', 'mathematical methods', 'neuron component', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuronal circuitry', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'scale up', 'theories', 'tool', 'web services']",NIBIB,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2016,450322,0.015400952020374769
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.

"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals learn statistical regularities in the acoustic environment and adapt their hearing to emphasize the elements of sound that are important for behavioral decisions. Using these abilities, normal-hearing humans are able to perceive important sounds in crowded noisy environments and understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings, even when sound is amplified above perceptual threshold. This study seeks to characterize how two major areas in the brain's auditory network, auditory cortex and midbrain inferior colliculus, establish an interface between incoming auditory signals and the internal brain states that select information appropriate to the current behavioral context. Single-unit neural activity will be recorded from both of these brain areas in awake ferrets during the presentation of complex naturalistic sounds that mimic the acoustic environment encountered in the real world. Internal brain state will be controlled by selective attention to specific sound features in these complex stimuli. Changes in stimulus-evoked neural activity as attention shifts among sound features will be measured to identify interactions between internal state and incoming sensory signals in these different areas. Previous work has identified a large corticofugal projection from auditory cortex to inferior colliculus that could produce task-dependent changes in selectivity in inferior colliculus. This study will test the role of these corticofugal projections by optogenetic inactivation of auditory cortex during recordings from inferior colliculus. Selective inactivation of specific pathways will characterize how the network of brain areas works together to produce effective auditory behaviors. Computational modeling tools will be used to determine, from an algorithmic perspective, how neurons encode information about the natural stimuli and how this encoding changes as attention is shifted between features. Data collected during behavior will be used to develop models that combine bottom-up sensory processing and top-down behavioral control. This computational approach builds on classic characterizations of neural stimulus-response relationships using spectro-temporal receptive field models. New models will be developed that incorporate behavioral state variables and nonlinear biological circuit elements into established model frameworks. Together, these studies will provide new insight into the computational strategies used by the behaving brain to process complex sounds in real-world contexts. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairments and central neurological disorders have difficulty processing and making accurate judgments about auditory stimuli, particular in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how the healthy brain learns to extract useful information from sounds in order to guide effective behavior. These experiments will provide novel insight into how the brain solves problems that can be used to develop new devices and treatments for these debilitating conditions.",Top-down control of auditory processing in the cortico-collicular network,9005185,R01DC014950,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Auricular prosthesis', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Central Auditory Processing Disorder', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ferrets', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'auditory stimulus', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'expectation', 'hearing impairment', 'insight', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'selective attention', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,327250,0.03193008162363176
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,0.017848272747929224
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms. These goals will be achieved by observing, mapping, and perturbing brain circuits using advanced technologies which will be disseminated to the entire neuroscience community to accelerate progress towards understanding brain function and dysfunction.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory,9126618,U01NS090541,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Ramp', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory Process', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social computing', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,75000,0.05186771143633985
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",9119539,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2016,956033,0.02077953566790879
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9177620,R01NS095251,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Records Controls', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,891206,0.002320471081249609
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9131824,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,492125,0.020541839332612038
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits. NARRATIVE This work has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of when learning decreases overlap between memories in the brain (differentiation) or increases overlap (integration). Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dementia, and dyslexia: In all of these conditions, cognitive deficits can arise when there is insufficient neural separation of memories or concepts (e.g., temporal lobe stroke can “collapse” stored visual knowledge, preventing retrieval of names of common objects). The learning models and interventions developed here may eventually lead to new and better ways of re-differentiating these collapsed representa- tions and ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.","Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning",9263587,R01MH069456,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Dyslexia', 'Electroencephalography', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Stroke', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'behavioral study', 'cost', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lens', 'memory retrieval', 'network models', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'phonology', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'simulation', 'theories']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,521520,0.029774514386545717
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,0.016427705943043425
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9145621,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2016,131400,0.008238689658653847
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,9111024,R00HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R00,2016,186761,0.028669768327379812
"Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data ABSTRACT  Neuronal spike-trains and various other signals in the central nervous system have a discrete, impulsive nature that is well characterized with point process statistical models. In several neuroscience applications, such impulsive signals are transformed upon interaction with biological processes or measurement artifacts, and are consequently observed as filtered point process data. The goal of this project is to develop a principled statistical signal processing framework for filtered point processes with models and algorithms for estimation and inference, and to apply these novel methodologies to experimental data from rodent brain calcium imaging data and human neuroendocrine data. Our approach centers on a unified framework for sparse representation and dynamical systems modeling of marked point process data arising in neuroscience analyses. In addition to its novel statistical methodology, another major strength of our proposal is the application of these methods to experimental data arising in fundamental neuroscience and clinical problems, both to validate the new methods with real data and to investigate basic science questions related to the central nervous system structural and functional organization. Large-scale two-photon calcium imaging, in conjunction with spike-train deconvolution, will allow us to study the activity of over a thousand identified neurons simultaneously with single-spike resolution in a behaving animal. This will allow us to elucidate with high accuracy how the magnitude and spatial structure of signal and noise correlations across neurons vary with stimuli or behavioral tasks. It will shed light on visual encoding in the rodent brain, and neuronal architectures underlying visual perception and cognition, at an unprecedented spatiotemporal scale. Further, our modeling of pulsatile hormone secretion will apply to the release of cortisol, gonadal steroids, insulin, thyroid and growth hormones. Diseases linked to abnormal cortisol secretion include diabetes, visceral obesity and osteoporosis, disturbed memory formation and life-threatening Addisonian crisis. Hence, understanding and modeling the underlying impulsive nature of normal hormone release will aid our understanding of pathological neuroendocrine states and improve the efficacy of drugs and other interventions for treatment of hormonal disorders. Additionally, this project will combine Brown Lab’s computational expertise in point process models with Sur Lab’s experimental expertise in neuronal calcium imaging, extending our ongoing collaboration under the NIH Brain Initiative to developing novel neural population analysis techniques with unprecedented detail at single-neuron, single-spike resolution. Our research is well poised to improve significantly the state of the art and in computational and systems neuroscience tools and bridge together components from the statistical learning, signal processing and computational neuroscience communities to produce a unifying analytical framework for neural data analysis. NARRATIVE  In this project we will develop a filtered point process framework for neural data analysis, with models and algorithms for sparse recovery of spike-trains from time-series data comprising a series of pulsed waveforms. We will use this novel methodology to extract neuronal spike-trains from calcium imaging data of cortical tissue, and to estimate hormone secretion times and amounts from serum hormone levels. We will make our mathematical algorithms for neural data analysis and their software implementation freely and easily available to the neuroscience research community.",Filtered Point Process Inference Framework for Modeling Neural Data,9170395,R01EB022726,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Corticotropin', 'Coupled', 'Cushing Syndrome', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Endocrine system', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Image', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Life', 'Light', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Noise', 'Osteoporosis', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Somatotropin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Hormones', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'V1 neuron', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'dynamic system', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mathematical algorithm', 'movie', 'neural model', 'novel', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'visual cognition', 'visual motor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2016,349970,0.02341832927854902
"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,9113674,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,476856,0.009047208342265413

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,9097799,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,341250,0.036200201050255974
"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement.                 n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9052441,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,425468,0.026077908446115756
"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8860217,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'neurotransmission', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'temporal measurement', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,228077,-0.001589568874132632
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,9106892,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2015,285469,0.036280323440795466
"Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our understanding of brain functions is hindered by the lack of detailed knowledge of synaptic connectivity in the underlying neural network. While synaptic connectivity of small neural circuits can be determined with electron microscopy, studies of connectivity on a larger scale, e.g. whole mouse brain, must be based on light microscopy imaging. It is now possible to fluorescently label subsets of neurons in vivo and image their axonal and dendritic arbors in 3D from multiple brain tissue sections. The overwhelming remaining challenge is neurite tracing, which must be done automatically due to the high-throughput nature of the problem. Currently, there are no automated tools that have the capacity to perform tracing tasks on the scale of mammalian neural circuits. Needless to say, the existence of such a tool is critical both for basic mapping of synaptic connectivity in normal brains, as well as for describing the changes in the nervous system which underlie neurological disorders. With this proposal we plan to continue the development of Neural Circuit Tracer - software for accurate, automated reconstruction of the structure and dynamics of neurites from 3D light microscopy stacks of images. Our goal is to revolutionize the existing functionalities of the software, making it possible to: (i) automatically reconstruct axonal and dendritic arbors of sparsely labeled populations of neurons from multiple stacks of images and (ii) automatically track and quantify changes in the structures of presynaptic boutons and dendritic spines imaged over time. We propose to utilize the latest machine learning and image processing techniques to develop multi-stack tracing, feature detection, and computer-guided trace editing capabilities of the software. All tools and datasets created as part of this proposal will be made available to the research community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At present, accurate methods of analysis of neuron morphology and synaptic connectivity rely on manual or semi-automated tracing tools. Such methods are time consuming, can be prone to errors, and do not scale up to the level of large brain-mapping projects. Thus, it is proposed to develop open-source software for accurate, automated reconstruction of structure and dynamics of large neural circuits.                ",Software for Automated Reconstruction of Structure & Dynamics of Neural Circuits,9030044,R01NS091421,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'high throughput technology', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'light microscopy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'open source', 'presynaptic', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,340627,0.007807804744941897
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8929339,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'developmental toxicity', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2015,613100,0.01076653947033056
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative. The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.",High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits,8856373,R01NS076467,"['2 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Fast Electron', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Vesicles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'design', 'experience', 'human tissue', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'millimeter', 'nanometer', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'young adult']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,1543491,0.029623494883031582
"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8890825,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'taste stimuli', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2015,166288,0.0593711088119509
"The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Movement rehabilitation is slowly transitioning towards an evidence and theory driven mode of operating where successful treatments are guided by an understanding of how the brain and the body work. As part of this transition, the development of models is very important. In the space of models, Bayesian and optimal control models have been particularly influential over the last decade or two. Models about statistically efficient processing in the brain (""Bayesian brain"") have been influential and assume that the brain is hardwired for solving statistical problems. Other, generally less popular, models assume that the brain just learns to act in a statistically efficient way from trial and error. For the interpretation of behavioral results this difference is crucial. An answer to this question promise to inform theories, electrophysiology and rehabilitation. Here we propose to use experiments with human subjects and model building to quantify the role of learning for the processing of uncertainty. We compare over trained tasks with novel tasks to ask if humans are hardwired for statistically efficient integration. We compare adults with children to ask if the appropriate experience solving these tasks is necessary. We perform generalization experiments to analyze the neural representation of uncertainty. And lastly, we build models of general learning systems for comparison with existing Bayesian models and test them on large databases. Across the experiments we will juxtapose two-alternative-forced-choice paradigms that quantify uncertainty with sensorimotor integration experiments that allow estimating its effect on behavior. The planned experiments will provide a nuanced answer to the question of how human behavior becomes so efficient in a statistical sense for important tasks. The three aims to be investigated in this project are: Aim 1: Determine if the brain needs to learn how to integrate uncertain sensorimotor information. We will ask if learning is necessary to allow humans to efficiently combine multiple pieces of uncertain information. While many current theories implicitly assume that efficient integration requires no learning our preliminary data suggests otherwise. Studying uncertainty is important as it is ubiquitous and affects learning. Aim 2: Determine if the representation of probability distributions and thus generalization is hardwired. We will ask if th generalization of uncertainty is hardwired or can be learned. This is important because generalization across tasks is one of the prime objectives of movement rehabilitation. Aim 3: Construct and test new models that learn how to integrate uncertain information. We will construct models, based on the idea of deep learning, that can explain statistically efficient processing in the brain without requiring it to be built in. The models will be tested against ""hardwired"" Bayesian models and a large database of behaviors. By building strong models that make accurate predictions about current and potential behavior would allow for more efficient and targeted movement rehabilitation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will use psychophysics to understand if humans are hardwired to efficiently deal with uncertainty or if they learn this ability for each task. Becauseof the popularity of ""Bayesian brain"" theories this question is of fundamental importance to our understanding of the brain. It is also of medical importance as uncertainty affects the speed and nature of motor learning, which is crucial for movement rehabilitation.                ",The role of uncertainty for motor learning and adaptation,8887443,R01NS063399,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prosthesis Design', 'Psychophysics', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Space Models', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'experience', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'model building', 'model development', 'motor learning', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO D/B/A SHIRLEY RYAN ABILITYLAB,R01,2015,339124,0.0027937610646763303
"Neural Signature of Fear Overgeneralization in Trauma Exposed Adults ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Populations exposed to severe trauma such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma related psychopathology. Over one third of the exposed individuals are likely to develop significant and disabling psychopathology including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder (PD), and major depression. However, efforts to advance knowledge on neural mechanisms of trauma related abnormalities have been hampered by a diagnostic categorical approach that has been focused almost solely on PTSD, neglecting a critical need to identify neural mechanisms of shared domains/constructs across anxiety, mood, and trauma-related disorders, which can be reliably measured and serve as physiological targets for novel treatments. Conditioned fear overgeneralization, in which there is deficiency in distinguishing learned danger cues from resembling safe stimuli, has been recently proposed as a potential endophenotype that crosses diagnostic boundaries including patients with PTSD, GAD and PD. The neural circuitry of fear overgeneralization has been elucidated in both animals and healthy humans, suggesting deficient functioning of the hippocampus and fear network regions. To advance identification of a neural signature of trauma related psychopathology that can potentially serve as a novel, neuroscience informed treatment target, and consistent with the RDoC emphasis on neurally-based domains of function across disorders, the current 4-year R01 application will use an fMRI paradigm for assessing fear overgeneralization among subjects with and without exposure to trauma (N=120). Eighty adults with well-ascertained, severe exposure to trauma and 40 matched non-trauma exposed healthy adults will be assessed. Rings of gradually increasing size will be visually presented during fMRI, with extreme sizes serving as conditioned danger cues (CS+; paired with electric shock) and conditioned safety cues (CS-). The rings of intermediary size serve as `generalization stimuli' (GS) and create a continuum-of-size between CS+ and CS-. Graphically represented conditioned-fear responses across this continuum, known as generalization gradients, have been reliably shown to have a steepness (or slope) that reflects the degree of generalization. For skin conductance response (SCR), a less steep slope indicates greater generalization. Separate generalization gradients will be generated by the paradigm for: a) regional fMRI activations; b) SCR; and 3) self-reported risk of shock. Machine-learning methodology will be applied to identify an fMRI-based neural signature of overgeneralization and test its associations with functional impairment and symptom severity across trauma- associated diagnoses. If successful, findings from this study will significantly advance the characterization of an endophenotype that will serve as an objective measure of pathology and a novel target for interventions specifically designed to target the impaired mechanism of overgeneralization and its neural signature.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Trauma exposed populations such as war veterans, disaster survivors, and assault victims are at high risk for a range of trauma-related psychopathology.

"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9052858,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213460,0.05773805908998186
"CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Humans and other animals can discriminate and recognize sounds despite substantial acoustic variability in real-world sounds. This ability depends partly on the auditory system's ability to detect and utilize high-order statistical regularities that are present in the acoustic environment. Despite numerous advances in signal processing, assistive listening devices and speech recognition technologies lack biologically realistic strategies to dynamically deal with such acoustic variability. Thus, a comprehensive theory for how the central nervous system encodes and utilizes statistical structure in sounds is essential to develop processing strategies for sound recognition, coding and compression, and to assist individuals with hearing loss.     This proposal presents a novel approach towards addressing the question of how the auditory system deals with and exploits statistical regularities for identification and discrimination of sounds in two critical mammalian auditory structures (inferior colliculus, IC; auditory cortex, AC) Aim 1 is to develop a catalogue of natural and man-made sounds and their associated high-order statistics. Cluster analysis and machine learning will be applied to the sound ensembles to identify salient statistical features that can be used to identify and categorize sounds from a computational perspective. Using information theoretic and correlation based methods, Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that statistical sound regularities are encoded in neural response statistics, including firing rate and spike-timing statistics of IC and AC neurons. Aim 3 will determine neurometric response functions and addresses the hypothesis that high-order statistical regularities in sounds can be discriminated based on temporal pattern and firing rate statistics of single neurons in IC and AC. Aim 4 will employ multi-site recording electrode arrays to tests the hypothesis that neural populations in IC and AC use high-order statistics for sound discrimination and that statistical regularities are encoded by regionally distributed differences n the strength and timing of neural responses or neuron-to-neuron correlations.     The study will provide the groundwork for developing a general theory for how the brain encodes and discriminates sounds based on high-order statistical features. A catalogue of neural responses from single cells, neural ensembles, and high-level statistical features that differentiate real world sounds will be developed and deployed as an on-line resource. The role high-order statics play for sound recognition and discrimination will be identified both from a computational and neural coding perspective, including identifying transformations across neural structures, spatial and temporal scales.     The project will foster collaborations between psychology, electrical engineering, and biomedical engineering departments at the UConn. Graduate, undergraduate and a post-doctoral student, including women and minorities, will participate in the research and will receive interdisciplinary training in areas of neurophysiology, computation neuroscience, and engineering. Drs. Read and Escabi regularly host summer interns in their labs and expect that 1-2 undergraduate students will be hosted per year. Graduate students will be enrolled in biomedical, electrical engineering, and psychology programs. Project findings will be integrated in graduate computational neuroscience and biomedical engineering coursework.     The findings could lead to a host of new sound recognition technologies that make use of high-order statistical regularities to recognize and differentiate amongst sounds. Understanding how high-order statistics are represented in the brain could guide the development of optimal algorithms for detecting a target sound (e.g., speech) in variable/noisy conditions. Such sound recognition systems are also applicable in industrial applications: for instance, identifying fault machine systems from machine generated sounds. Knowledge of the statistical distributions in real world sounds and music will be useful for sound compression (e.g., mpeg coding) and to develop efficient sound processing algorithms. Finally, the findings can be incorporated in auditory prosthetics that mimic normal hearing physiology and make use of high-order sound statistics to remove background noise or enhance intelligibility. n/a",CRCNS: The role of sound statistics for discrimination and coding of sounds,9047911,R01DC015138,"['Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Engineering Psychology', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inferior Colliculus', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychology', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Detection Analysis', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'doctoral student', 'graduate student', 'hearing impairment', 'man', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'theories', 'trait', 'undergraduate student', 'web site']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2015,311320,0.013591279494537088
"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions. Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.",Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects,8893998,R01EY022727,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Stimulus Deprivation-Induced Amblyopia', 'Stroke', 'Swimming Pools', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Visual attention', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'coping', 'data mining', 'distraction', 'flexibility', 'goal oriented behavior', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'sustained attention', 'visual information', 'visual process', 'visual processing']",NEI,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,318059,0.015284499244719986
"Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aberrant processing of social and affective information is a severe and disabling symptom across many neuropsychiatric disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders, depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Recent reports demonstrate that direct electrical brain stimulation (EBS) can alter perception, such as changing the identity of a person being viewed or causing memory-related hallucinations. If EBS can distort normal perception, then EBS using different parameters may be able to normalize SAP, for example by modulating affective salience to visual stimuli in PTSD. One key impediment towards developing EBS as a therapy for SAP pathology is that we lack an understanding of how electrical stimulation modulates neurodynamics and cognition. A critical step towards designing rational EBS-based stimulation parameters for SAP pathology is building a causal model of the millisecond-scale temporal dynamics, interregional interactions, and EBS modulation of these dynamics and interactions during SAP. Visual SAP relies on a neural circuit in the temporal lobe that includes the amygdala, fusiform gyrus (FG), and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Non-invasive brain imaging techniques either lack the temporal resolution to examine millisecond dynamics (fMRI/PET), or are relatively insensitive to activity in deep brain structures such as the amygdala (MEG/EEG/TMS). Direct neural recordings using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in individuals undergoing neurosurgical evaluation for epilepsy will allow us to overcome these barriers to study the dynamics and interactions in the SAP circuit. Furthermore, delivery of EBS via these implanted electrodes will allow us to examine how electrical modulation of this circuit alters SAP. Using iEEG and advanced analysis methods from machine learning, we recently delineated the set of information processing stages that FG goes through for face perception. In this project, we will test a three- stage dynamic model of the sequence of events and interregional interactions that enable SAP based on these previous results, the work of others, and our preliminary data. We will record iEEG in our regions of interest to test neural dynamics during three critical aspects of social affective processing: perception of facial expression (Aim 1), the inference of actions from motion (Aim 2), and guiding conscious perception to affectively and socially salient stimuli (Aim 3). Then we will employ EBS to modulate perception during these processes. In addition, we will supplement iEEG with magnetoencephalography (MEG), which, while less sensitive to amygdala activity, provides whole-brain cortical coverage and facilitates the comparison of iEEG results to a normative population. The outcome of the proposed research will be a spatially and temporally specific model of the causal dynamics and interactions during SAP. This model will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted EBS therapies that may normalize pathological SAP.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Abnormalities in social affective perception are a critical part of the etiology of numerous neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The proposed research will map the detailed neurodynamics of critical aspects of social affective perception and examine how these neurodynamics, and the associated cognitions, can be modulated by brain stimulation. The results of this research will lead to a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of social affective perception, a circuit relevant to a number of mental disorders, and take a critical step towards determining how brain stimulation may be used to remediate pathological social affective perception.                ","Inside the social perception network: dynamics, connectivity, and stimulation",8957240,R01MH107797,"['Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Biological', 'Body Image', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Expression Perception', 'Feedback', 'Figs - dietary', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Goals', 'Hallucinations', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Posture', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Social Perception', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'causal model', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'encephalography', 'evidence base', 'face perception', 'healthy volunteer', 'information gathering', 'information processing', 'interest', 'kinematics', 'millisecond', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,502152,0.02030207296254601
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Knowledge from the transcranial magnetic and electrical DC stimulation experiments may have translational applications for rehabilitation following brain injuries.                ",Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms,8946229,R01DC014736,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Auditory', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Computer Simulation', 'Dementia', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Loudness', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Music', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Vision', 'Work', 'age related', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive process', 'cost shifting', 'fighting', 'image guided', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neural stimulation', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'prefrontal lobe', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'theories', 'vector', 'vigilance']",NIDCD,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2015,283560,0.022460872500739838
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.                ",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,8814777,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'motivational processes', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2015,561912,0.003551237588346052
"ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as spike trains, comes from individual neurons. Other signals, including local field potentials (LFPs), electroencephalography (EEGs), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. With all of these sources of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationary. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities. They also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. The research in this grant aims to provide methods for analyzing the ways that network structure may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior, which involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales. Fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. At slower timescales there is considerable redundancy in the recorded signals, which suggests dimensionality reduction. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. These methods are tailored to handle spike trains, LFP, and MEG data, especially as they might arise in experiments related to mental health research. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFP, EEG, and MEG data) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statisticl analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.            ",ANALYSIS OF NONSTATIONARY NEURAL DATA,8961749,R01MH064537,"['Accounting', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'frontier', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'parallel processing', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'scale up', 'statistics', 'trend']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,378758,0.04038251529632221
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics.

"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. To make focused progress, we will undertake a comprehensive integration of experiments and computational models of the structure and function of whole-brain circuits in transparent fish experiencing virtual reality.","Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity",8935965,U01NS090449,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Fishes', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mono-S', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Plastics', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Receptors', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learned behavior', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'scaffold', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,U01,2015,952773,0.02077953566790879
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8856663,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,400000,0.012677798883799779

The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8935976,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2015,250000,0.0356518648684872
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8899642,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'cognitive task', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'mental function', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,313000,0.0314401931582796
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8807937,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,341436,0.005953352443163441
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.          ",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9029452,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,507375,0.020541839332612038
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,0.016427705943043425
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism. Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.",Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders,8847802,K01MH094689,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Encapsulated', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gur', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Ruthenium Ben', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Societies', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Structure of middle temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory pathway', 'career', 'developmental disease', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'functional outcomes', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'language processing', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2015,168157,-0.000970984827594795
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.

Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms.

"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,0.008238689658653847
"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8849468,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive development', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2015,82417,0.028669768327379812

"Instructive Signals for Motor Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synapses between neurons are plastic - able to become stronger or weaker. When we learn, new memories are encoded in modified synapses across our brains. The aim of this project is to understand the rules that determine which synapses will change during learning, and how that change results in an adapted behavior. In particular, we will analyze how an error in a movement acts as a trigger for synaptic change that, in turn, improves the accuracy of subsequent movements. When an incorrect movement is made, the brain gets feedback about the error, and uses this information to guide the induction of plasticity at appropriate synapses. The part of the brain responsible for motor learning, the cerebellum, gets this feedback about errors through a synaptic input known as a climbing fiber. When an error in movement occurs, activity in the climbing fiber is an ""error signal"" that sends the message to the cerebellum that the circuit controlling the movement needs to be adjusted by adjusting the strength of some of the synapses. It is usually the synapses that were recently active that are modified. We will analyze which patterns of activity in the climbing fibers or othe cerebellar neurons are necessary and sufficient to cause plasticity to be induced. The rules governing the induction of plasticity at the synapses in a circuit define the algorithm that circui uses to learn. A better understanding those rules can guide strategies to more effectively tap the learning potential of neural circuits in both healthy individuals, those with neurological disorder, and in patients relearning how to control their movements after stroke This proposal addresses not just unanswered questions in the field of motor learning, but is relevant for a more general understanding of how the synaptic plasticity mechanisms in a neural circuit may be finely tuned for the specific computational demands of the behavior it controls.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed experiments will elucidate neural learning rules governing the local ""decisions"" cerebellar synapses make on a moment-by-moment basis about whether to alter their strength, based on their pattern of input. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how these local decisions are coordinated throughout a neural circuit to yield an algorithm for the adaptive regulation of the circuit's function over multiple time scales. An understanding of the algorithms that neural circuits use to tune their own performance will have broad impact on everything from artificial intelligence to designing interventions to optimize learning in health and in neural circuits damaged by injury, stroke or disease.            ",Instructive Signals for Motor Learning,8964760,R01NS072406,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cerebellar vermis structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Learning', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Plastics', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'memory encoding', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'oculomotor', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'therapy design', 'vestibulo-ocular reflex', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,473336,0.009047208342265413
"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8928250,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'differential expression', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,341250,0.036200201050255974
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8692440,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,227375,-0.001589568874132632
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign-yet annoying-examples of 'normal' forgetting, it is aso a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have proposed two core mechanisms that are thought to reduce interference-related forgetting: integration and pattern separation. Integration involves 'fusing' overlapping memories into a common representation such that the relationship between these memories is more complementary than competitive. Pattern separation involves the orthogonalization of similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for interference minimized. While there is general agreement that these mechanisms are theoretically appealing and offer clear computational advantages, clear evidence for how and when these learning mechanisms are invoked- particularly in humans-remains surprisingly limited? In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity-that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation-to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may represent only an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia-groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate memory confusions and susceptibility to interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting and will develop neurodiagnostic tools that can be used to characterize memory processes and predict susceptibility to memory confusions and forgetting.            ",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,8802305,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confusion', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Predisposition', 'Psychology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data mining', 'experience', 'forgetting', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,306165,0.036280323440795466
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body. This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.",Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity,8768889,UH3TR000506,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Angioblast', 'Animal Testing', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Databases', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug toxicity', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Erinaceidae', 'Exposure to', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Hydrogels', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Myelogenous', 'Nature', 'Neural Crest', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Population', 'RNA Sequences', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Robot', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'Washington', 'Yolk Sac', 'base', 'capillary', 'cognitive change', 'cost effective', 'drug development', 'embryonic stem cell', 'experience', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'neural plate', 'neurodevelopment', 'notch protein', 'precursor cell', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal exposure', 'progenitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NCATS,"MORGRIDGE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH, INC.",UH3,2014,596891,0.01076653947033056
"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The PI is a faculty member of the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior at Stony Brook. His research focuses on spontaneous and evoked neural activity in the gustatory cortex. The candidate recently transitioned to neuroscience from a theoretical physics background. This award will provide the necessary five-year protected period for the candidate to receive training in systems and theoretical neuroscience and electrophysiological techniques, under the supervision of the proposed mentorship committee. By the end of the termed period, the candidate will achieve his long term career goals of successfully applying for independent research funding and becoming an independent investigator in the field of theoretical neuroscience. The goal of the proposed research plan is elucidating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity in the gustatory cortex, and its modulation by anticipatory cues. Spontaneous neural activity in sensory cortices, traditionally regarded as a noisy baseline, is increasingly drawing attention: it can predict trial to trial variability; it contains information on the functional architecture of neural networks; and it was characterized as either a ""repertoire"" of possible network activities or a storage of expectations of sensory stimuli, shaped by development. In the context of taste processing, however, it has received little to no attention. The aim of this proposal is to elucidate the properties of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex. This is an ideal system, due to the rich temporal dynamics of responses to taste stimuli, represented in terms of taste-specific sequences of patterns of activity, synchronized across the whole neural population. The first goal of the proposed plan is to employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to elucidate the features of spontaneous activity in relation to evoked activity. This will provide new analytical tools for the characterization of spontaneous activity and reconcile within a single framework the different views currently held in the literature, by introducing the new feature of temporal dynamics. As a second goal of the proposed project, the role played by anticipatory cues in modulating the relation between spontaneous and evoked activity will be elucidated, and the dependence of reaction times on spontaneous activity will be clarified. A biologically plausible model of spontaneous activity in the gustatory cortex will be introduced, based on networks of spiking neurons. This model will yield a mechanistic understanding of the feature of spontaneous activity as revealed by the analysis of electrophysiological data.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is designed to uncover the dynamical features of spontaneous neural activity in the gustatory cortex and to elucidate its role in modulating the processing of taste---related information under different behavioral contexts. The relation between spontaneous and stimulus---evoked activities is the active subject of debate in the neuroscience literature; this project will develop novel analytical and modeling tools aimed at clarifying the extent to which spontaneous and evoked activity are intertwined. The results of this effort will provide a new perspective on the cortical mechanism underlying taste processing in normal conditions, and bears important implications on issues related to public health, such as the role played by attention in food consumption disorders.                ",Spontaneous activity in gustatory cortex,8766158,K25DC013557,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Study Subject', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taste Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vertebrates', 'analytical tool', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'design', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'markov model', 'member', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'stem', 'tool']",NIDCD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,K25,2014,167410,0.0593711088119509
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.        The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8662794,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2014,124361,0.0014639234966538407
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8710346,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,418570,0.042712051166255774
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8686083,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,400000,0.012677798883799779
"Neural circuits in zebrafish: form, function and plasticity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to combine whole brain 2-photon imaging of neural activity in behaving larval zebrafish with detailed anatomical and connectivity information extracted from the same animals. The final goal is to generate quantitative models of brain wide neural circuits that explain the dynamic processing of sensory information as well as the generation of motor output by these circuits. Anatomical data will be generated by two complementary technologies: 1) whole brain EM data sets will be prepared from the same fish that were used for calcium imaging. Respective data sets will be registered to each other, functionally relevant neuronal ensembles will then be identified in the EM stacks and connectivity will be analyzed in these sub-networks via sparse reconstruction. 2) EM based connectivity information will be supplemented by trans-synaptic viral tracing technology. These two technologies for identifying synaptic connections have complementary strengths and weaknesses and are thus ideally suited for combination with in-vivo 2-photon calcium imaging studies. The specific power of this approach is that all three techniques, whole brain calcium imaging, viral tracing and EM reconstruction, can be done in the same animal. Functional, anatomical and behavioral data can then be analyzed in the context of the specific stimuli and quantified behavioral output and subsequently synthesized into a theoretical framework. To that end we will start with quantitative models of simple reflex behaviors, like the optomotor and optokinetic reflex, where the transformation of sensory input to motor output is relatively straightforward and well defined. These elementary models will serve as a scaffold that can be refined and complemented by additional data from structure function studies from fish performing in more sophisticated behavioral assays that involve more complex stimuli, different modalities and plastic changes. As such the process of building such a ""virtual fish"" will be an iterative, open ended process that requires continuous and bidirectional exchange of information between the theoretical and experimental groups of the research team.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Physical neural circuits and their patterned activation give rise to all thought and behavior, and abnormal circuits and activity patterns underlie neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abiliies. Working memory has been closely associated with multiple kinds of neural activity dynamics, such as persistent neural activity, activity ramps, and activity sequences. The neural circuit mechanisms of these dynamics remain unclear. This proposal will apply advanced technologies such as virtual reality, automated monitoring of behavior, in vivo microscopy, ontogenetic, and neural circuit reconstruction to solve fundamental problems in the understanding of working memory. The accumulation of evidence over time scales of seconds, a type of working memory critical for decision-making, will be used as a test bed for studying working memory. The proposal will build upon a rodent evidence-accumulation paradigm that allows quantitative, temporally precise parameterization of working memory and decision-making. The paradigm will be implemented with head-fixed rodents behaving in a virtual reality system (Aim 1), providing mechanical stability that enables the use of two-photon calcium imaging to observe neural activity related to working memory in the neocortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum (Aim 3). Brain activity will also be perturbed using ontogenetic to probe the roles of brain regions and specific cell types in the formation and stabilization of memory (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop methods for probing the roles of cell types and connectivity in working memory through correlative serial electron microscopy and light microscopy as well as imaging of population responses to ontogenetic stimulation of single cells or groups of cells (Aim 4). This three-year project will produce a catalog of the types of neural circuit dynamics that are related to working memory across many brain regions. In subsequent years, this catalog will be mechanistically investigated by the anatomical and physiological methods developed in Aim 4. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circut mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. The understanding is expected to take the form of a new generation of models containing cognitive variables distributed across brain regions, as well as models that explicitly represent neural circuit dynamics. This achievement will be a crucial step towards a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of cognition.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information for mental manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities and s disrupted in diseases such as schizophrenia. The long-term goals of this project are to characterize neural activity dynamics related to working memory in diverse brain regions, and to account for those dynamics in an integrated, brain-wide fashion in terms of cellular and circuit mechanisms. These goals will be achieved by observing, mapping, and perturbing brain circuits using advanced technologies which will be disseminated to the entire neuroscience community to accelerate progress towards understanding brain function and dysfunction.                ",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory,8827069,U01NS090541,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Ramp', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory Process', 'Short-Term Memory', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Whole-Cell Recordings', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U01,2014,250000,0.05186771143633985
"Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The cortex is a laminated structure that is thought to underlie sequential information processing. Sensory input enters layer 4 (L4) from which activity quickly spreads to superficial layers 2/3 (L2/3) and deep layers 5/6 (L5/6) and other cortical areas eventually leading to appropriate motor responses. Sensory responses themselves depend on ongoing, i.e. spontaneous cortical activity, usually in the form of reverberating activit from within or distant cortical regions, as well as the state and behavioral context of the animal. Receptive field properties of neurons can rapidly and adaptively be reshaped when an animal is engaged in a behavioral task, indicating that encoding of stimuli is dependent on task- or context-dependent state. Responses also depend on ongoing cortical dynamics in a lamina-dependent fashion and differ between the awake and anesthetized state. The intricate neuronal interplay between behavioral context, ongoing activity, and sensory stimulus underlying cortical representations is unknown.  Specifically, we do not know how neuronal circuits shape these emergent dynamics within and between laminae, and we do not know which neurons encode which aspect of a sensory stimulus. One shortcoming of all prior studies of sensory processing is that only a few neurons are sampled, and thus information about the interactions between neurons, and between neuron and global brain state is lacking.  Here we address these challenges by developing new in vivo 2-photon imaging technology that allows rapid imaging and stimulation in multiple focal planes and new computational and information theoretic techniques to extract network dynamics at the single neuron and population level. These measures go beyond paired measures and take synergistic interactions between neurons into account. We use these new techniques to investigate the 3D single cell and population activity patterns in the auditory cortex in mice. We investigate the influence of single neurons relative to the synergistic influence of specific groups of neurons (the crowd) on network dynamics and ultimately behavior of the animal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Functioning of the normal, healthy brain, such as in sensory processing and motor actions, depends on the precise interactions of millions of nerve cells.  Brain diseases are increasingly linked to changes in these complex interactions between large populations of nerve cells.   The current project develops novel imaging tools and analysis concepts to simultaneously study large groups of nerve cells in the awake brain with high temporal and cellular resolution, and will lay the groundwork for deeper insights into how the brain processes information and may provide mechanistic insights into brain disorders such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.                ",Crowd coding in the brain:3D imaging and control of collective neuronal dynamics,8827121,U01NS090569,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Crowding', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Light', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'auditory discrimination', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'density', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'millisecond', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'receptive field', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'spatiotemporal', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NINDS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",U01,2014,250000,0.0356518648684872
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.

"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8624688,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2014,344886,0.005953352443163441
"Engineering Microbial Opsins for Neuroscience via Structure-Guided Recombination     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microbial opsins are light-sensitive proteins that can be expressed in specified cells via targeting promoters and turned on/off with millisecond speed, thus providing genetic and optical ('optogenetic') control of cell function with high spatial and temporal specificity. Their ability to control the electrical activity of neural circuits and confe reversible gain and loss of function of specific neuronal phenotypes allows us to study neural systems and diseases in unprecedented manner. Optogenetic research today, however, relies on a limited set of natural microbial opsins with broad activation spectra, limited ion selectivity and a narrow range of kinetics. We are proposing a novel approach to opsin engineering that capitalizes on the power of structure-guided protein engineering and directed evolution. In parallel, we will also search for novel naturally occurring opsins in niche environments. The expanded optogenetic toolkit will facilitate the investigation of neuronal circuits in health and disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain disorders take a great toll in the US and worldwide. Progress has been limited by the availability of tools to investigate neuronal circuits with temporal and special specificity until the development of optogenetics.

"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,0.04146903398425665
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures.

"Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A hallmark of human development is the ability to make adaptive changes in perception that occurred as a result of experience. The internal representations that influence perception must be constructed from multiple levels of statistical information that are present in the natural environment. To illustrate what is meant by statistical information, after hearing a bark, there is a higher probability of seeing a dog than seeing a cat (i.e. p(Vdog | Adog) > p(Vcat | Adog). While it is widely believed that information acquired via statistical learning is an essential component of experience-based perceptual development, little is known about the neurobiological and behavioral mechanisms that translate experience into lasting perceptual change or how variations in these mechanisms can lead to atypical or delayed development. This proposal addresses three major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms of experience-based perceptual development: 1) the effect of statistical information on neural activity in sensory cortices in infancy; 2) whether deviations in these neural responses predict developmental delays in a high-risk population; 3) the relationship between statistically-induced changes in neural activity and behavioral changes in perception. Aim 1 Characterize the effects of statistical information on neural activity early in postnatal development. Typically developing, 6-month-olds will undergo near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) recording to reveal changes in neural activity in auditory and visual sensory cortices during and after experience with cross-modal statistical information. We hypothesize that infant sensory cortex will exhibit significant changes in activity (i.e., increased activity during an unexpected visual omission) as  result of statistical experience. Aim 2 Examine deviations in statistically-induced neural activity in at-risk populations. If statistically-induced neural responses support typical development in numerous domains, abnormal neural responses to statistical information will predict poor behavioral outcomes later in postnatal life and establish biomarkers that could assist in ameliorating abnormal development. Using data from Aim 1 as a comparison group, we will characterize neural responses in infants at high risk for delays in perceptual and cognitive develop- ment as a result of being born extremely preterm (< 28 weeks). Aim 3 Determine the relationship between statistically-induced neural activity and perceptual change. Visual cortex activity after a visual stimulus produces a visual percept, but the behavioral consequences of visual cortex activity during the unexpected omission of a stimulus are unknown yet are essential to understanding how statistically-induced neural changes support perceptual development. Guided by specific hypotheses, we will correlate neural responses to unexpected omissions to behavior on perceptual tasks.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Changes in perception as a result of our experience are an essential component of infant development and in turn are key to supporting human cognition. The current proposal is significant because it is the first step in a program of research which is expected to lead to a full understanding of how experience shapes the perceptual systems in the human brain starting in infancy. Because this process of experienced-based changes in perception is believed to be foundational for normative development, such an understanding could help predict developmental delays and re-conceptualize a myriad of developmental disorders such as autism, WIlliam's Syndrome and Specific Language Impairment.                ",Role of Statistically Induced Changes in Sensory Cortex in Perceptual Development,8634272,K99HD076166,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attenuated', 'Auditory', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Felis catus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neonatology', 'Neural Pathways', 'Occipital lobe', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'aged', 'awake', 'base', 'comparison group', 'developmental disease', 'early experience', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'postnatal', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'specific language impairment', 'statistics', 'visual stimulus']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,K99,2014,82417,0.028669768327379812
"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8722888,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2014,8990,0.03438738511557661
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon branching is a key step in developing neural circuits that are critical to human behaviors. During embryonic development, formation of axonal branches is high regulated in time and space, and disruption of normal control can cause synaptic defects associated with many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Although molecular mechanisms have begun to be identified in the past decade, the precise temporal and spatial control of axon branching is poorly understood. The central projection of the sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglion develops stereotypic branches that are found in many vertebrates. They include axon bifurcation at the dorsal spinal cord that relays somatosensory information such as pain and touch to the brain, and collateral branches that invade the white matter and form local reflex arcs. Formation of these branches is precisely regulated during development, making them excellent model to understand molecular and cellular mechanisms of axon branching. Following our recent identification of extracellular cues for bifurcation and intrinsic determinants for collateral formation, the proposed study will use both in vitro cultures and mouse mutants to investigate the mechanisms underlying the formation of both structures. Specifically, we will combine molecular, genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to address three key questions: 1) How do extracellular cues cooperate and regulate the intracellular machineries to ensure bifurcation happens once and only once at a defined location? 2) How does a cytoskeleton protein MAP7 serve as a signaling center to regulate sensory collateral formation? 3) How does the expression of transcriptional co-factors Ldb1/2 contribute to the developmental time control for collateral formation? Answers to these questions will help understand the mechanisms governing the temporal and spatial regulation of branching that is critical to sensory circuit development. Given the wide expression of these molecules and the frequent appearance of the two branching processes, our proposed studies of this evolutionarily conserved cell model will fill in a major gap in our study of axon branching We also expect that the knowledge obtained here can be translated to understanding other brain circuits. Thus the proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of investigating brain functions and disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to understand both extracellular and intrinsic mechanisms underlying the spatial and temporal control of axon branching during development. It focuses on two stereotypic branched structures of sensory axons in the spinal cord. Results from the proposed study will not only provide a better understanding of neural circuit development, but also shed lights on the etiology of developmental brain disorders associated with abnormal branching regulation.                ",Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Axon Branching in Neural Circuit Development,8761846,R01NS062047,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cartoons', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Growth Cones', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Invaded', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'LIM Domain', 'Laboratories', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Microtubule Bundle', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins', 'Microtubules', 'Mission', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morphogenesis', 'Motor', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurons', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phosphorylation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reflex action', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sculpture', 'Sensory', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Ganglia', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'axon growth', 'cell growth regulation', 'cell motility', 'extracellular', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'spinal nerve posterior root', 'success', 'white matter']",NINDS,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,339427,0.036200201050255974
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse  background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8532012,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,227049,-0.001589568874132632
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.          This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.          Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8517819,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2013,119387,0.0014639234966538407
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.            ",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8558913,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,413444,0.042712051166255774
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8473286,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,384000,0.012677798883799779
"A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The neocortex consists of billions of neurons with trillions of connections, and is responsible for cognitive tasks such as perception and abstract reasoning. Cortical abnormalities are associated with devastating neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, further underscoring the importance of understanding how the cortex functions. Despite major advances in understanding the properties of individual neurons, we are just beginning to understand the rules that govern the assembly of neocortical circuits.  One major unanswered question in the field is whether molecular mechanisms direct the wiring diagram of neural circuits at the level of individual cells. In other words, is there a genetic blue print that governs the local wiring of cortical circuits? Tis question is technically challenging to address because it will require simultaneous analysis of both neuronal connectivity and the gene expression profile at the level of single cortical neurons. Moreover, it will require massive amounts of data to be collected as well as advanced analysis techniques to crack the molecular code of connectivity. We propose to use multi-whole-cell patch clamp recording combined with single-cell reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to investigate whether the clustered protocadherin gene family provides a molecular code for neural circuit assembly. The clustered protocadherins have been shown to be expressed in a combinatorial code in individual neurons, are highly expressed during synaptogenesis, and localize to synapses. Thus, clustered protocadherins are the leading candidate molecules for shaping neocortical circuits. However, their role in instructing specific synapse formation has not been directly tested due to the difficulty of these types of experiments. Furthermore, the challenging aspects of this project make it unlikely to be funded by more traditional mechanisms. The results of these experiments could revolutionize our understanding of neural circuit assembly and lead to a more principled approach to studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to test the hypothesis that there is a molecular code that governs the connectivity of cortical circuits. Abnormal connectivity in neocortical networks is thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism spectrum disorder. Discovering the molecular code of connectivity in the cortex will provide us with the genetic blue print to study how cortical circuits are assembled and promises to also provide a paradigm shift for studying neuropsychiatric disorders at the circuit level.                ",A MOLECULAR CODE FOR CONNECTIVITY IN THE NEOCORTEX,8639755,R01MH103108,"['Address', 'Adhesions', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Part', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Family', 'Genetic', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Psyche structure', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Reverse Transcription', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain research', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'genetic manipulation', 'information processing', 'molecular marker', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'synaptogenesis', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2013,313000,0.0314401931582796
"Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurogenic (vasovagal) syncope (VVS) is a significant medical problem. The faint is preceded by a Vasovagal Response (VVR), characterized by a sudden drop in arterial blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). VVS and VVRs are diagnosed using a tilt test, a vestibular stimulus. Despite being relatively common, the neural basis of the VVR and the role of the vestibular system in inducing VVRs are not known. Moreover, there is no small animal model of VVRs. We recently showed that low frequency sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS) induces VVRs in anesthetized rats. As in humans, VVRs are also induced in rats by tilt. In the proposed research we will characterize the physiological properties of VVRs in rats, thereby establishing a useful small animal model of human VVRs. We propose that VVRs are induced by strong, repeated stimulation of the vestibulo-sympathetic reflex (VSR), which maintains blood flow to the brain during changes in head position relative to gravity. Aim 1 will characterize the transitions from normal VSR to VVRs using pulses and sinusoids of galvanic stimulation to show that VVRs occur when the VSR is appropriately stimulated. Nose up tilt and Translation-While-Rotating (TWR) will be used to determine the axes of stimulation that are most likely to produce VVRs. Additionally, the low frequency oscillations in HR and BP that are produced by sGVS and tilt reflect activation of Mayer waves, thought to be of fundamental importance in maintaining BP stability. In Aim 2 these oscillations will be modeled using a novel concept in which Mayer wave function is represented by a non-linear relaxation oscillator. In Aim 3, single unit neurophysiological studies in otolith-recipient portions of the caudal vestibular nuclei will identify the functional characteristics and physiological signature of VVR- related neurons. Together, the proposed research will establish a model of VVS, document how the vestibular system controls BP, and demonstrate that VVRs are adaptive compensatory responses that serve to re- equilibrate BP after major perturbations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vasovagal syncope (VVS; unexpected fainting) and vasovagal responses (VVR) are a significant medical problem when they recur frequently; the underlying causes and neural mechanisms that produce such fainting are unknown. We have recently shown that activation of the vestibular system causes arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes in anesthetized rats that are similar to the changes in humans during these faints. In this project, we will characterize the changes in blood pressure and heart rate that are produced by activation of the vestibular system with tilts and galvanic stimulation, model the process that is causing the faints with a novel relaxation oscillator, and investigate the underlying neuronal basis for these responses.            ",Vestibular Control of the Vasovagal Response,8505855,R01DC012573,"['Acceleration', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Baroreflex', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discontinuous Capillary', 'Drops', 'Feedback', 'Force of Gravity', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Head', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Reaction', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Relative (related person)', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Stimulus', 'Syncope', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vasovagal', 'Vasovagal Syncope', 'Vestibular nucleus structure', 'Width', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'data modeling', 'falls', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'otoconia', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'vector']",NIDCD,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2013,365000,0.005953352443163441
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8424238,K99NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2013,90662,0.016427705943043425
"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.          This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.

"Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neural circuits are formed using a two-stage developmental process that includes an initial period of exuberant synapse formation, followed by a longer period of activity-dependent synapse elimination. While pruning has been well-documented in many organisms and brain regions, little attention has been paid to the rate at which synapses are eliminated during development. Different pruning rates have a strong effect on the quality and plasticity of the resulting neural circuits, and indeed, many neurological diseases have been linked to abnormal synapse levels in the cortex during critical developmental periods.  We hypothesize that pruning rates in the cortex have been optimized to achieve both connectivity and robustness of underlying neural circuits. To test our hypothesis, we propose a joint experimental-computational research plan to explore how synapse levels change during development and how these changes manifest at the network and phenotypic levels. First, we will quantify the precise rate of synapse elimination during development of the mouse barrel cortex using a specialized electron microscopy (EM) preparation that selectively stains for synapses. We will develop a fully-automated and high-throughput image processing pipeline that will allow us to count tens of thousands of synapses per time point and gain robust statistics of pruning rates and the time of peak synapse density. Second, we will develop computational models of synaptic pruning to evaluate how pruning rates affect information processing in neural circuits. Our computational experiments will explore how sparse circuits emerge that are capable of efficient and robust encoding, while still being flexible enough for plasticity and adaptation and while meeting metabolic costs. Our models will also help us answer questions about global neural circuitry, including whether hubs are likely to exist and how functional modules are formed. Third, we will examine cases of synapse rewiring and reorganization following abnormal developmental conditions. We will repeat our EM procedure using mouse models of Fragile X syndrome and Rett syndrome to compare synapse levels with respect to control, and we will extend our computational models to understand circuit-level differences in these conditions.  The proposed project will generate new computational and experimental solutions for analyzing network development and will lead to biological insights into how local pruning mechanisms affect global circuit properties.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Many neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Fragile X syndrome (Autism) and Rett syndrome, are believed to be caused by faulty developmental processes in the brain. To understand precisely when and how these changes manifest, it is important a) to quantify synapse levels in the brain over time in fast, automated, and scalable ways and b) to create models of how these changes affect circuit processing and function. Together, these approaches can help identify critical periods for diagnosing neurodevelopmental disorders and aid with their early detection and treatment.                ","Synapse Elimination during Development: Pruning Rates, Models, and Diseases",8527041,F32MH099784,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutant Strains Mice', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Organism', 'Plastics', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Solutions', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Telecommunication Network', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Vertebral column', 'barrel cortex', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical developmental period', 'critical period', 'density', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mouse development', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'wireless network']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2013,52190,0.03438738511557661
"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.",Object Concepts,8537463,R01EY021717,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'austin', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'mental representation', 'novel', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,374225,0.046064719991974555
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding. The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes  sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders  of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past ten years a good deal has been learned from fMRI studies about the spatial patterns of neural activation used by the human brain to represent meanings of words and concepts. Much less is understood about the time evolution of this neural activity, including the temporally interrelated sub-processes the brain employs during the hundreds of milliseconds it takes to comprehend a single word, or the more complex processes it uses to construct and encode meaning of entire sentences as the words arrive one by one. We propose research to study, and to build computational models of, the detailed spatial and temporal neural activity observed during the comprehension of single words, phrases, sentences, and stories. This proposed research will specifically target the following questions: ""What information is encoded by neural activity where and when, and by which subprocesses in the brain, during the time it takes to comprehend a single word in isolation?"" ""What is the flow of information encoded when a newly sensed word first activates sensory cortex, then later results in neural activation encoding the word meaning?"" ""How does the brain integrate a newly encountered word in the context of earlier words in the sentence or phrase, to compose the meaning representation of the multi-word phrase or sentence?"" and ""How do semantic expectations and demands, together with syntactic sentence structure alter the processing of words, compared to processing the same words in isolation, or as an unstructured set such as {kick, Joe, ball}?"" To study these questions we will (1) devise novel experimental protocols to probe the flow of information encoded in neural signals during word and sentence processing, (2) collect new brain image data using both fMRI to achieve spatial resolution of a few millimeters, and MEG to achieve temporal resolution of a few milliseconds, (3) develop and apply novel machine learning approaches to build computational models that integrate and that predict this combined experimental data. Our goal is to develop an increasingly accurate computational model of how the brain comprehends words, phrases and sentences - a model that makes testable predictions about the neural activity observed in response to novel language stimuli. Intellectual Merit: This collaborative research brings together advanced machine learning algorithms with novel experimental protocols for MEG and fMRI brain imaging to advance our understanding of two fundamental open questions about the human brain: how does the brain represent meaning, and what neuro-cognitive processes construct that meaning piece-by-piece from perceived language stimuli? Broader Impacts: If successful, this research will impact a broad range of communities, including (1) cognitive neuroscience and computational linguistics, providing improved understanding of language processing in the brain, (2) machine learning, by driving the development of new methods for time series and latent variable analysis, integrating multiple data sets, and incorporating diverse background knowledge as priors, (3) clinical studies of brain pathologies, especially those related to language processing, and informing treatment strategies for developmental and acquired language disorders (4) education of graduates, undergraduates and the general public, through dissemination of technical articles, teaching materials, and news about our work in the public press. n/a",CRCNS: Information Flow in the Brain During Language and Meaning Comprehension,8444787,R01HD075328,"['Acquired Language Disorders', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Evolution', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graduate Education', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Teaching Materials', 'Time', 'Word Processing', 'Work', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'expectation', 'improved', 'language processing', 'millimeter', 'millisecond', 'neural patterning', 'news', 'novel', 'phrases', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'syntax', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2012,246375,-0.001589568874132632
"Human iPS/ES Cell-Based Models for Predictive Neural Toxicity and Teratogenicity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal brings together leading experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology (Thomson), tissue engineering (Murphy), and machine learning (Page) to develop improved human cellular models for predicting developmental neural toxicity. Dramatic progress has been made in the derivation of many of the basic cellular components of the brain from human pluripotent stem cells (ES and iPS cells), but these advances have yet to be applied to predictive toxicology. The major components of the brain are derived from diverse embryological origins, including the neural plate (neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes), yolk sac myeloid progenitors (microglia), migratory mesodermal angioblasts (endothelial cells), and neural crest (vascular smooth muscle and pericytes). Because of their diverse origins, these components have very different inductive signaling histories. This means that deriving them all at once under the same conditions is not currently possible. For this reason, we will differentiate human pluripotent stem cells to early precursors of the major neural, glial, and vascular components of the cerebral cortex separately, cryopreserve the precursors, and subsequently combine them in 3D hydrogel assemblies to allow increased physiological interactions and maturation. Specifically, we will embed committed precursors for endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia into hydrogels displaying combinations of peptide motifs that promote capillary network formation. We will then overlay this mesenchymal layer with neural and glial precursors to mimic the normal interactions between the cephalic mesenchyme and the neural epithelium, and promote the formation of the polarized layers of the cerebral cortex. After drug exposure, we will assess temporal changes in gene expression by these cerebral neural- vascular assemblies using highly multiplexed, deep RNA sequencing. Then, using safe drugs and known neural/developmental toxins from the NIH Clinical Collection, the University of Washington Teratogen Information System Database, and the EPA's Toxicity Reference Database as training sets, we will develop machine learning algorithms to predict neural toxicity of blinded drugs known to have failed in late stage animal testing or human clinical trials. This predictive, developmental neural toxicity model will be implemented on liquid handling robots and sequencers in widespread use, and will be readily adaptable to platforms being developed in complementary efforts by DARPA. The developmental potential of human pluripotent stem cells, the modular nature of the tunable hydrogels, and the discriminatory power of machine learning tools also makes the general approaches proposed readily applicable to predictive toxicity models for other tissue types throughout the body.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials. To accomplish this, experts in human pluripotent stem cell biology will grow the required neural components in the laboratory, experts in tissue engineers will assemble those cells into multicellular constructs, and experts in machine learning will use changes in gene expression after drug exposure to predict whether a test compound is toxic.              This project will develop three-dimensional constructs of human neural tissue to better predict the neural toxicity of drugs prior to clinical trials.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.        The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.

"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. The proposed program of research is designed to (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of novel health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms that promote message success to advance theory.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.

"Neural mechanisms of attentional priority for visual features and objects     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. To cope with such information overload, humans need to selectively attend to relevant information and prioritize its processing. In many situations, humans need to select arbitrary features and objects in the scene and maintain attention on the selected information. It is often assumed that an attentional priority signal encodes the current focus of attention and its deployment. However, how the brain computes and maintains attentional priority for features and objects is not known. The long-term goal is to understand how the brain selects different types of information and how selection shapes perception to serve goal-oriented behavior. The objective of this proposal is to delineate the cortical circuitry representing attentional priority for features and objects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Based on recent data obtained in our laboratory, we hypothesize that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents different types of selected information with distinct neural populations, forming a multiplexed representation of attentional priority. In this proposal, we wil test this hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. First, we will determine the neural representation of attentional priority for visual objects. Second, we will seek to establish a quantitative link between priority signals and task performance. Third, we will determine the relationship between attentional priority signals for features and objects and those for spatial locations. Fourth, we will evaluate the degree of categorical representation of attentional priorit, which is essential for flexible deployment of attention. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how the brain selects and maintains non- spatial information, thus filling in a critical gap in the current scientific knowledge. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects features and objects will provide important constraints for models of attention and can potentially transform our understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The proposed research is innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the research will test the novel hypothesis that the dorsal frontoparietal network represents attention priority for non-spatial dimensions, challenging the prevailing view that these cortical areas mainly represent spatial information. Methodologically, the application of cutting-edge machine learning and data mining techniques (pattern classification, similarity and clustering analysis) represents a novel approach that more fully exploits the complexity and richness of fMRI data than conventional methods. Finally, the proposed research can make connections to other fields such as category learning and decision making, and suggest interesting future directions to examine common neural processes underlying these cognitive functions.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia. By elucidating the basic brain mechanisms of attention, the proposed research will inform our understanding of the nature of attentional deficits in these disorders and contribute to the basic research foundation that will ultimately guide the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.                  Impairment in attention is associated with many neuropsychological conditions, such as neglect due to stroke, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as certain visual problems such as strabismic amblyopia.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8286826,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2012,124361,0.0014639234966538407
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                   The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction.

Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8348319,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2012,400000,0.014636146692212776
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.                This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function.

"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls. This research will lead to a better understanding of how treatment works and why some children do not respond to treatment.              This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.        Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"Object Concepts  Project Summary What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.  Narrative Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain.

"High Resolution Connectomics of Mammalian Neural Circuits    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this work is to develop and validate a new suite of technologies that can rapidly and routinely generate circuit diagrams of nervous system tissue, sometimes called connectomes. The small size of neuronal processes and the synapses that connect them require that reconstruction be done at nanometer resolution; the distributed nature of neuronal connectivity requires reconstruction of large volumes, extending over a millimeter or more. Our method meets these two seemingly incompatible challenges by combining novel sectioning, electron microscopic imaging and reconstruction technologies. Together, these advances will allow us to acquire data and map circuits at least 1000-fold faster than has previously been possible. As a first test, we will reconstruct the retinal circuit of a mouse in its entirety. Enough is known about retinal structure and function to make this an appropriate tissue to validate the method. At the same time, this background will allow us to pose and solve important problems about neural circuits that will be directly applicable to the brain. We will then use the method to compare neural circuits in young adult and aged retina, providing insight into the structural basis of age-related neural decline. Finally, we will test the application of this connectomic method to human tissue. The new methods introduced here will transform neuroscience in several ways. First, it will allow elucidation of the structural underpinnings of brain function. It will also provide insight into how neural circuits are refined in early life and altered in old age. Second, applied to the ever increasing number of animal models of human behavioral disorders, it will help researchers delve into pathologies of cognition, behavior, and affect, some of which likely arise from miswiring of neural circuits. Finally, the method can be applied to any biological tissue where three-dimensional reconstruction of multiple large-volume specimens would be informative.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors. Until we can acquire and decipher connectomic patterns, we will not know how acquired information is organized and encoded in the brain, or whether, as many suspect, miswiring underlies a variety of developmental, aging, and behavioral disorders. As the human genome project demonstrated, biomedical science can be transformed by scaling up and speeding up technologies to the point where they can provide comprehensive information about essential biology; our brain circuit reconstruction will be fast enough to compare entire circuits from multiple individuals at nanometer resolution.           The connectome of each individual is probably unique, containing the traces of experiences and learned behaviors.

"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8150936,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2011,124361,0.0014639234966538407
"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.

"Multimodal Neuroimaging of Prosody in Schizophrenia and Developmental Disorders    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An inability to convey emotion by vocal modulation (prosody) is a major aspect of social cognitive dysfunction for patients afflicted with a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism. The neural mechanisms of these deficits, and how they develop from childhood to adulthood have received remarkably little research attention. This training proposal seeks to prepare the candidate for independent research that addresses both of these issues. In terms of the neural mechanisms of prosody, there is some evidence that prosodic dysfunction is associated with a disruption of interactions between temporal and frontal cortex. The temporal component of this circuit appears to parse the acoustic signal for emotional distinctions, which are subsequently evaluated for emotional meaning by the frontal component. It is likely that this circuit mediates prosodic dysfunction in schizophrenia, which is associated with basic audio-sensory deficits and abnormal temporo-frontal interactions. The research proposed here will employ multimodal neuroimaging approaches to produce the first comprehensive description of this temporo-frontal circuit, in both healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia, by integrating three state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques. First, magnetoencephalography (MEG) in conjunction with magnetic resonance functional connectivity analysis (fMRI) will be used to determine the time course of processing by the circuit. Then, by applying Diffusion Imaging, these functional estimates will be related to neurostructural estimates of auditory pathway integrity. We expect to demonstrate that neurostructural integrity deficits underpin abnormal temporo-frontal interactions during prosodic processing in schizophrenia. In addition to training the candidate in multimodal neuroimaging, the proposed activities will provide him a background in the developmental psychology of language and auditory neurobiology, as well as a framework to develop and adapt prosodic tasks for children and adolescents. The candidate is an Instructor in Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and has an established interest in social communication. Drs. Timothy Roberts and Ruben Gur will mentor him. Dr. Roberts is an expert in MEG and DTI techniques, with a research focus on the development of auditory and language processing in healthy children and patients with autism. Dr. Gur is an expert in neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging, whose research concerns emotional and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. These mentors will assure that the experience resulting from the proposed training plan will enable the candidate to establish an independent research program that can make significant contributions in the developmental neuroscience of social communication, and the understanding of how dysfunction in such communication emerges in neuropsychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and autism.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness. Greater understanding of the neural nature of this dysfunction and how it unfolds during development should provide important etiopathic information that could lead to new treatments. This would benefit public health by helping to facilitate patient integration into society.              Impaired social communication is an enduring and debilitating aspect of neuropsychiatric illness.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"Object Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What does it mean to know something about the world? Central to any theory of knowledge is a theory of concepts, those mental representations that allow us to categorize information in the world. In this project, we attempt to understand concepts by studying their neural instantiation. The central aim of this project is to advance our understanding of the neural representation of concepts via a characterization of similarity. The broader goal of this research program is to develop a strategy for understanding the neural representation of all types of knowledge; however, to make this problem more tractable, we are focusing on a specific type of concept - concrete objects - and on a particular type of knowledge about those concepts - their visual appearance. Specifically, (1) We aim to describe the neural representation of object concepts by characterizing neural tuning to features in a multidimensional similarity space; (2) We aim to examine variation in the neural representations of object concepts, across concepts, across individuals, and across attentional states; (3) We aim to explore to role of sleep-dependent consolidation processes in the acquisition of new object concept knowledge; (4) We aim to develop innovative methods for the characterization of neural similarity more generally.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world. Concepts organize our experiences, and they alter perception, memory, language, and action. The goal of this project is to understand the way in which conceptual knowledge is organized and the manner in which it is implemented in the brain. We will apply innovative neuroscientific methods to discover how we learn about the objects around us and how we access that information when remembering those objects.           Without concepts, we would be unable to make sense of the infinite variation in the world.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,0.012149193770147542
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7883451,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,28699,0.0003425887726838786
"The Neural Bases of he Semantic Structure of Words and Concepts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project proposes to discover the neural representation of some simple words and concepts. It uses newly developed machine learning techniques and dimension reduction methods applied to fMRI brain activation data that will be acquired in new experimental paradigms. This research approach has for the first time succeeded in identifying the content of individual human thoughts based on the pattern of brain activity. The initial published studies have demonstrated this capability in the case of concrete nouns and physical objects. This project proposes to expand the approach to a much larger set of different types of concepts and to examine the effect of the way the concept is presented (e.g. a written or spoken word, or a picture). The goal is to develop a comprehensive theory of how neural representations of meaning arise from the various brain systems that are used in interacting or considering the concept. An important secondary goal is to determine the degree of commonality of the neural representations across people.  The studies propose to examine the neural dimensions of meaning in three domains: (a) physical objects; (b) human traits, emotions, and interpersonal interactions; and (c) small numerical quantities. This set of semantic domains is expected to provide sufficient breadth to reveal some of the principle neural bases of semantic representation.  In contrast to the field of ""semantics"" (the study of the relation between words and their meanings), this project will help establish a new research area, neurosemantics, which is the study of the relation between words, thoughts, and their neural representations. The key assumption is that the underlying dimensions of meaning representation in the human brain are derived from basic neural systems. For example, one of the dimensions of representation of a physical object is how one physically interacts with or handles it. This dimension of representation is underpinned by a network of cortical areas that co-activate when one thinks about a physical object, and also when one actually handles the physical object. Other dimensions of neural representation similarly emerge when the concept is encountered. The studies will collectively identify the major dimensions of concept representation and relate them to networks of co-activating brain areas.  The cumulative knowledge from the completed project will provide the framework of a theory of how brain systems map onto the representation of the meaning of concepts. The theory will be applicable to understanding and designing therapies for neurological conditions in which the meanings of concepts are distorted, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and autism. The resulting theory will be foundational in relating the representation of meaning to brain function.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy. More generally, as a recent review (Bray et al., 2009) indicates, the new approach provides a good match to the brain characteristics of several brain disorders, and it is beginning to be applied for health-related purposes in many domains.              PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE  The research has application to a number of neurological disorders, where the new approach is capable of (1) determining whether and how the neural representation of a particular set of concepts is distorted; (2) tracking the progressive loss of neurosemantic components in disorders affecting the representation of meaning (including Alzheimer's Disease, Pick's Disease, semantic dementia, and anomic aphasia); (3) identifying the particular neurosemantic dimensions that are affected by the disorder; and hence (4) pointing the way to the design of a therapy.

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7798636,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2010,35821,0.011139494415537628
"Intracranial EEG for Neuronal Oscillatory Contingency during Cognitive Tasks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain computer interfaces (BCI) involving motor and sensory systems have been successful in restoring function and in improving the lives of patients with neurological diseases. These devices, ranging from deep brain stimulators for Parkinson's disease to more involved devices capable of recapitulating motor function, are becoming increasingly available with recent technological advances and with a greater understanding of underlying neural circuitry. A major area not addressed by these devices is that of higher cognitive functions, such as memory and executive planning. Here, we propose to use intracranial electrocorticographic signals, captured from subdural and depth electrodes implanted in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy, to extend the role of BCIs to the cognitive domain. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the patterns of neuronal activity that underlie memory storage and recall can be used to adjust stimulus presentation in a cognitive task to augment learning. We propose to develop a BCI that measures and analyzes intracranial neural activity in real time as patients engage in a free recall task, a standard method of measuring one's ability to encode and retrieve episodic memories. Using machine-learning algorithms, we will identify the precise spatiotemporal patterns of electrophysiological brain activity that lead to optimal memory formation. We will compute these patterns separately for each patient. Our system will thus adapt to each individual's brain activity. To close the functional loop between the patient's brain and our system, we will take advantage of these naturally occurring optimal spatiotemporal patterns for memory formation and trigger stimulus presentation on their presence. Animal studies have shown that by presenting stimuli contingent on the oscillatory state of the hippocampus, learning rates can be improved. We hope to demonstrate that conditioning stimulus presentation on the presence of these optimal spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity will improve both memory storage and recall in our patients as well. Such a demonstration will establish a causative, rather than correlational, relationship between these patterns of activity and memory encoding. Furthermore, our research will extend the domain of BCIs to the realm of cognition and memory, and lay the groundwork for a range of BCI systems that can enhance a wide variety of human cognitive functions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time. Recent BCIs have played an integral role in rehabilitating patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, severe depression, and epilepsy. One critical area not addressed by BCIs to date is that of higher cognitive functions, including memory -- one of the major deficits in a number of neural diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we propose a novel BCI for improving memory performance both in memory-impaired and cognitively normal individuals.           Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time.

"CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Intellectual Merit: There is compelling evidence that the distinct stages of sleep play an essential role in the long-term consolidation of memories (Marshall & Born 2007). Specifically, slow-wave sleep (SWS), which is hallmarked by slow oscillatory activity (< 1 Hz) in the human electro-encephalogram (EEG), has been implicated in memory consolidation. We demonstrated that weak electric currents (<1mA, <1Hz and DC) applied to the scalp during SWS modulate these endogenous EEG rhythms and can improve human memory performance (Marshall 2006a). Moreover, application of the same weak currents during learning modulates ongoing EEG rhythms that are typical for the awake state in humans and boosts immediate performance in some learning tasks (Kirov 2009). Yet, despite these remarkable phenomenological findings, the question of how weak currents can modulate brain oscillations and induce plastic changes in brain function remains fundamentally unaddressed. Here we propose to quantitatively address this question through the development of computational models that are tightly constrained by specialized brain-slice experiments and validated through targeted human subject experiments. A central question is: how can weak electric currents, that appear insufficient to modulate excitability or plasticity in quiescent neurons, exert such a powerful effect on oscillations and learning? Our central hypothesis is that weak currents couple into ongoing slow oscillatory activity that then boost their modulatory effect on synaptic plasticity. Preliminary data from our group and others already provides strong evidence for modulation of endogenous rhythmic network activity by applied currents - at intensities considered too weak to affect single neuron function. Concurrently, we and other groups have investigated links between slow wave activity and memory consolidation, including by application of weak currents in human. But a specific connection between the effects of applied weak currents on slow-wave rhythms and plasticity has so far not been explored. Guided by computational models, the crucial empirical link between the two will be sought by probing lasting changes resulting from weak-current stimulation of an in vitro cortical preparation that exhibits SWA. Targeted human experiments will directly test if applied currents also enhance the consolidation of other SWS-mediated learning as the hypothesis would suggest, or rather, if the effect is limited to hippocampus-related learning, thus providing significant constraints to the computational models.    Broader Impacts: Weak applied currents are being explored in a number of empirical studies for their potential benefits to treat depression and neuropathic pain, to assist motor learning after stroke, or more generally, to enhance cognitive performance and to improve learning. The promise of this technique is that weak currents can be applied non-invasively with a potentially broad range of applications and minimal side effects. The enigma in this potentially transformative clinical tool, however, is that the electric field strengths generated by these currents in most studies are two orders of magnitude below what is required to activate an otherwise silent neuron. Currently, research in this area is almost entirely phenomenological and the few mechanistic explanations for the promising phenomenological observations are superficial (e.g. describing all brain function as a ""sliding scale of excitability"") and do not address plasticity - as such, there is no rational basis for improving and targeting stimulation protocols. This work is the first attempt at establishing the mechanistic link between applied currents on endogenous rhythms and the associated SWS-related learning enhancements. Evidently, such an analysis will address basic science questions about the link between endogenous SWS and learning, add to the set of experimental tools which can be used to study cognition, and, shed light on the functional and causal role of the ubiquitous endogenous rhythms generated by the brain.    Consistent with present call for US/German Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience this project will combined the expertise of international researchers in the areas of: (1) effects of noninvasive electrical stimulation on nervous tissue (Bikson, US), EEG signal analysis and computational network models (Parra, US), human sleep and learning with applied currents (Marshall, Germany), and dynamical systems and machine learning (Claussen/Martinetz, Germany; Parra, US).           n/a",CRCNS:  Effects of Weak Applied Currents on Memory Consolidation During Sleep,8055164,R01MH092926,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Chemosensitization', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Frequencies', 'German population', 'Germany', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'International', 'Ion Channel', 'Kale - dietary', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neocortex', 'Nerve Tissue', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plastics', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Stages', 'Slice', 'Slide', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'computational network modeling', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'density', 'electric field', 'human subject', 'imprint', 'improved', 'memory trace reactivation', 'motor learning', 'neocortical', 'painful neuropathy', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIMH,CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK,R01,2010,125618,0.0014639234966538407
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7846781,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2010,317364,0.02504612234935215
"The Role of LFP Spatial Structure in the Hippocampus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this work is to understand how the activity of neurons is coordinated within the hippocampus, a brain region involved in the storage of memories. One manifestation of this coordination is the local field potential (LFP), the summed electrical activity of a small volume of neural tissue. Recently, multi- electrode arrays (MEAs) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of LFPs and single-neuron activity from multiple sites within the brain of an animal as it performs a task. This advance motivates the development of new computational methods that can identify the relationships that exist within these rich, large data sets. The temporal structure of hippocampal LFPs is known to correlate with single-neuron activity, as well as with behavioral state. In contrast, the spatial structure of these LFPs remains relatively unexplored. An interesting example of this spatial structure are the traveling LFP waves that propagate through the hippocampus. This project will examine whether the spatial dynamics of the hippocampal LFP influence neuronal activity and its relationship to behavior. Its aims are 1) to identify a parsimonious model for explaining the observed spatio- temporal structure in the LFP; 2) to investigate the relationship of LFP structure to single-neuron activity; and 3) to understand how LFP structure governs circuit-level neuronal processing within the hippocampus. To achieve these goals, this project will employ statistical learning techniques to extract spatio-temporal regularities from within the LFP, and use predictive models to examine the influence of different LFP structures on the population activity of hippocampal neurons. This work will identify concise metrics that capture the richness of high-dimensional hippocampal LFP measurements. Furthermore, it will examine the utility of incorporating complex dynamical features into current models of hippocampal processing. This work may help understand how distortions in electrical activity within the hippocampus lead to conditions such as epilepsy and amnesia. It will evaluate the suitability of the LFP as a direct target for neuroprosthetic interventions. Finally, it may lead to screening procedures for rapidly finding potential abnormalities in patients' brain activity, and help understand the implications of such abnormalities for patients' lifestyles.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories. These waves exhibit spatial patterns that may help guide the proper function of the hippocampus. This work could potentially explain how distortions in electrical activity relate to defects in people's abilities to form and recall memories.              Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop a more complete description of the electrical waves of activity found in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that stores memories.

"Coding of auditory space in the avian brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): All auditory information used for sound localization ascends through the brainstem auditory nuclei. We will use physiological and theoretical approaches to understand how multidimensional features of sound, relevant to sound localization, are processed and encoded in the avian auditory brainstem. A primary advantage of using barn owls for the exploration of auditory processing is the substantial body of behavioral, anatomical and neurophysiological work that has elucidated the mechanisms of sound localization. The main cues owls use to compute sound direction are the interaural level difference (ILD) and the interaural time difference (ITD). Unlike mammals, owls use ILD to determine the vertical coordinate of the sound source and ITD to determine the horizontal coordinate. Two independent brainstem pathways process ITD and ILD and converge in the midbrain, where a spatiotopic map of auditory space emerges. Activity of neurons in the map precedes, and stimulation evokes, a head-orienting response towards the sound source. Thus, in barn owls, the neural algorithm for sound localization can be viewed as a system in which two input variables (ITD and ILD) are processed in parallel in order to control two output variables (horizontal and vertical coordinates of head saccades). We have used theoretical models to describe the neural responses that encode spatial information in the owl's auditory system. This approach has guided our experiments and aided the interpretation of our findings. Behavioral experiments in humans have used a similar approach to sound localization. However, due to a lack of neural data in humans, the predictive power of models of sound localization with regard to the neural bases of behavior has been a persistent question. Our studies in barn owls address this issue by investigating the mechanism of neural computations that are fundamental to models developed for human sound localization. This proposal is organized around three primary questions: 1) What are the computational primitives of auditory-space processing in the owl's brainstem? 2) How is spectrotemporal information encoded, transmitted and processed in parallel with spatial information? 3) What fundamental changes in information coding occur at the crossroads between the auditory midbrain and forebrain? We will address these questions using a wide range of strategies and techniques - intracellular in vivo recordings, cell-attached recording in vivo, multi-neuron tetrode recording, and modeling - which will make our approach interdisciplinary and of broad scope. Our research seeks to understand the function of the auditory brainstem and midbrain. In doing so, we will identify the types of information that are available to upstream nuclei and show how this information is encoded. A comprehensive approach to information processing in the auditory brainstem has the potential to provide new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing. By linking biology and engineering, mathematical formulations of brain processes can advance technology related to robotics and neural prosthetics. Cochlear implants that provide encoding of stimuli in ways that are more biologically relevant can be built, while devices acting downstream of the cochlea could aid patients with compromised or non-functional auditory nerves. By its differences and similarities with other species, the avian brain provides an excellent model system to define fundamental properties of neural processing and neural coding.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will test hypotheses based on human models, of how the auditory system computes sound direction. This approach has the potential of providing new avenues for better understanding disorders of the central auditory system and cognitive impairments involving hearing.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7581008,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2009,51103,0.012149193770147542
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7677589,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'depressed', 'depression', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28398,0.0003425887726838786
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.

"Intracranial EEG for Neuronal Oscillatory Contingency during Cognitive Tasks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Brain computer interfaces (BCI) involving motor and sensory systems have been successful in restoring function and in improving the lives of patients with neurological diseases. These devices, ranging from deep brain stimulators for Parkinson's disease to more involved devices capable of recapitulating motor function, are becoming increasingly available with recent technological advances and with a greater understanding of underlying neural circuitry. A major area not addressed by these devices is that of higher cognitive functions, such as memory and executive planning. Here, we propose to use intracranial electrocorticographic signals, captured from subdural and depth electrodes implanted in patients with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy, to extend the role of BCIs to the cognitive domain. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the patterns of neuronal activity that underlie memory storage and recall can be used to adjust stimulus presentation in a cognitive task to augment learning. We propose to develop a BCI that measures and analyzes intracranial neural activity in real time as patients engage in a free recall task, a standard method of measuring one's ability to encode and retrieve episodic memories. Using machine-learning algorithms, we will identify the precise spatiotemporal patterns of electrophysiological brain activity that lead to optimal memory formation. We will compute these patterns separately for each patient. Our system will thus adapt to each individual's brain activity. To close the functional loop between the patient's brain and our system, we will take advantage of these naturally occurring optimal spatiotemporal patterns for memory formation and trigger stimulus presentation on their presence. Animal studies have shown that by presenting stimuli contingent on the oscillatory state of the hippocampus, learning rates can be improved. We hope to demonstrate that conditioning stimulus presentation on the presence of these optimal spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity will improve both memory storage and recall in our patients as well. Such a demonstration will establish a causative, rather than correlational, relationship between these patterns of activity and memory encoding. Furthermore, our research will extend the domain of BCIs to the realm of cognition and memory, and lay the groundwork for a range of BCI systems that can enhance a wide variety of human cognitive functions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time. Recent BCIs have played an integral role in rehabilitating patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, severe depression, and epilepsy. One critical area not addressed by BCIs to date is that of higher cognitive functions, including memory -- one of the major deficits in a number of neural diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Here we propose a novel BCI for improving memory performance both in memory-impaired and cognitively normal individuals.           Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) are machines that directly interface with the brain by measuring and analyzing neural activity in real time.

"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7692174,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural patterning', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2009,318428,0.02504612234935215
"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.

"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Causal Perceptual Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objectives of this research are to make original contributions to scientific understanding of biological perception. The specific aims are to: 1) develop and test a causal model of touch sensations' integration with visual sensations for perception, and to generalize this model for application to a broader class of sensory integration phenomena, 2) apply causal models to investigate how humans perceive cause-and-effect events, 3) increase the applicant's technical proficiency with causal modeling and applied machine learning methods. The proposal includes two main projects; the first will measure how humans judge the size of objects when their distances are uncertain. Specifically the first project examines the theory that human perception uses knowledge about how size and distance sensations are caused to integrate related sensations. Human experimental participants will view objects while touching them and report their perceptions of the objects' sizes, which will be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. The second project investigates how humans perceive cause-and-effect chains of events by examining the theory that the brain uses built-in knowledge of rudimentary physical behaviors, like momentum in collisions, to interpret such simple events. Human experimental participants will view colliding objects and report what occurred, which will again be used to evaluate theoretical predictions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The public health relevance of this research is to increase scientific and medical understanding of the neural communication and processing strategies the brain employs to create perceptual experiences, so that people with perceptual impairments can be provided with effective rehabilitation programs and biotechnological substitutes for diminished capabilities. Specific impairments include blindness and low-vision, traumatic brain and nervous system injuries, and strokes. In particular, modern sensory prostheses are now using computerized components that can interface with neural pathways to more comprehensively and effectively restore normal abilities in patients, and whose development faces significant obstacles establishing effective communication channels with the biological nervous system.          n/a",Causal Perceptual Processing,7545242,F32EY019228,"['Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Class', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Distance Perception', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lifting', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plague', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'Water', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'analytical method', 'computer monitor', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'insight', 'object perception', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'sensory prosthesis', 'size', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2008,44846,0.007877310483502003
"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7408288,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'concept', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2008,48739,0.012149193770147542

This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7480923,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2008,319340,0.02504612234935215
"CRCNS: Info. Process. & Neuronal Coordination: Neocortex DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain dysfunctions underlying schizophrenia are poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is likely that a critical aspect of this disease is a breakdown of the normal information processing functions of the neuronal assemblies. This project would study the activity of neuronal populations in sensory neocortex and investigate how neuronal assembly activity is disrupted in the dissociative anesthetic (PCP) model of schizophrenia.      Experimental investigation of this question will require recording large numbers of cells in functioning neural circuits. However, obtaining this data is only the beginning: the computational and statistical machinery to draw meaningful conclusions from such data must also be developed. Here we propose a collaborative research project between a mathematician (Kenneth Harris) and an electrophysiologist (Gyorgy Buzsaki), with the aim of recording, analyzing, and modeling the activity of large neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex and its disruption by psychotomimetic drugs. The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The development of advanced neuroprosthetic systems and brain-machine interfaces for high-capacity, real-time, bi-directional communication with the nervous system is a major challenge to the emerging neural engineering discipline.  While recent advances in the fabrication of high-density microelectrode arrays (HDMEAs) for multiunit recording and stimulation have triggered numerous neurobiological discoveries, the resulting large data throughput and the variability of cortical responses over repeated trials preclude the ability to design a wireless, adaptive, fully implantable large-scale interface to the cortex.  This severely limits the feasibility and space of experimental paradigms needed to improve our understanding of the nervous system functionality and characterize cortical responses in freely behaving subjects interacting naturally with their surroundings.  The objective of this project is to develop a wireless interface to the cortex capable of processing simultaneously recorded neural signalsfrom 64 electrode channels in real time.  The project has 3 aims:  1.  Develop advanced signal processing algorithms for sensing and decoding neuronal response properties from distributed intra-cortical neural activity:  1) Optimize our existing signal processing algorithms for hardware implementation to extract the desired neural activity early in the data stream; 2) Develop new algorithms for decoding these responses to characterize the natural behavior of awake, behaving animal models.  2.  Design low-power integrated circuits and wireless telemetry for a 64 channel system:  1) Optimize the design of a low power Neural Interface Node (NIN) module to feature wireless communication and powering capability for subcutaneous implantation; 2) Design and fabricate an extracranial Manager Interface Module (MIM) to permit:  a) wireless powering and data exchange with up to 2 implanted NIN modules; b) wireless bidirectional exchange of data and control with a central base station.  3.  Demonstrate the system functionality in vitro and vivo:  1) Build a 32 channel system and test its performance in vitro in retinal slices and in vivo in awake behaving rodents; 2) Demonstrate the real time functionality of a 64 channel system in vitro and explore its feasibility in vivo; 3) Optimize the entire system design, and benchmark it against a commercial 64 channel wired data acquisition system.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This project seeks to develop a wireless electronic microsystem to be implanted in the rat brain to continuously monitor neural signals when the rat is freely behaving in an open environment.  This system will help understand how brain cells process information.  This will help design assistive technology for people with severe paralysis.       n/a",A Wireless Multiscale Distributed Interface to the Cortex,7533930,R01NS062031,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cavia', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Communication', 'Computer information processing', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Microelectrodes', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'System', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Wireless Technology', 'awake', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain machine interface', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'desire', 'disability', 'implantation', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'microsystems', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'prototype', 'quantum', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'tool']",NINDS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,527963,0.03192269700528442
"Processing Discourse Reference in Mind and Brain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research aims to uncover the functional and neural processes that underlie reference comprehension, especially with respect to the relation between reference form and referent salience. Explaining how reference is processed is critical for understanding natural language use, which crucially depends on the matching between referential expressions and real world referents. The specific hypothesis tested in this research is that the choice and processing of referential form reflect general memory processes that are involved in the representation of multiple referents and that are prone to interference, especially when the referents are salient. According to this ""interference view"", the use of general referential forms such as pronouns can reduce this interference and is therefore preferred when referents could be easily identified. At the neural level this hypothesis predicts that repeated full reference to salient referents would increase brain activation both in areas that are involved in the semantic representation of referents (e.g., regions in the temporal lobe for many types of object referents) and in areas that are known to support the manipulation and integration of multiple representations such as the areas around the intra parietal sulcus (IPS). Self paced reading and matching functional MRI (fMRI) experiments will test the central predictions of this view. The first prediction that will be tested is that behavioral and neural interference is associated with repeated reference to a salient referent but not to a non salient referent. The second prediction that will be tested is that not only repeated names (e.g., 'Joe') but also repeated definite description referents (e.g., 'the man') lead to behavioral and neural interference when the referent is salient. The third and last prediction that will be tested is that non repeated category definite description references (e.g., 'the bird' as a reference to 'the robin') lead to reduced interference similar to pronouns. Because little is currently known about the brain basis of referential processing, any data about these issues would be valuable. The application of converging behavioral and fMRI methodologies to this new theoretical account is unique in discourse research and holds promise for bridging functional accounts of discourse processes with their possible brain basis. Therefore, tying referential processing to underlying brain mechanisms would represent a major leap forward in terms of the scientific understanding of these issues. Such understanding is important for the diagnosis and treatment of language disorders, especially ones that involve deficits in referential processing such as Alzheimer's disease. The better understanding of these processes may also lead to methods and strategies for improving life quality in patients suffering from language disorders and their families.

"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,0.0025019365993227387

"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7269518,R01MH066990,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Drug Formulations', 'Engineering', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Numbers', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'feeding', 'motor control', 'neural prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2007,35821,0.011139494415537628
"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7613805,R01MH075706,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Engineering', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Normal Range', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Range', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2007,320177,0.02504612234935215

The project will rely on two techniques we have developed over the last years: large-scale neuronal recordings using silicon microelectrodes; and the data analysis method of peer prediction. The use of silicon probes will allow for estimation of the location of recorded cells, identification of monosynaptic connections between cell pairs, and characterization of neurons as pyramidal cells or interneurons. Experimentally identified assembly structure will be interpreted in the context of this circuit-level information.      We will investigate the hypothesis that psychotomimetic effects of low doses of dissociative anesthetics are caused by a partial distortion in assembly organization, whereas larger doses cause a more complete distortion resulting anesthesia. If reliable signatures of psychotomimetic doses on assembly structure are found, this will suggest a novel method of drug screening for antipsychotics, whereby candidate drugs are evaluated by their ability to reverse these signatures. n/a",CRCNS: Info.

"Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  fMRI experiments produce large, numerically rich, but noisy data sets that pose a challenge for extracting the signal variance and establishing the correspondence between that signal and cognitive variables.  Conventional analysis has reduced the dimensionality of fMRI data by searching for clusters of voxels that show similar responses to experimental manipulations and averaging the signal within those clusters.  We have introduced a new approach to fMRI data analysis, ""multi-voxel pattern analysis"", that examines higher spatial frequency patterns of activity - the voxel-by-voxel variation of response within a region - and have shown that this method greatly increases the sensitivity of fMRI (Haxby et al. 2001; Hanson et al. 2004; OToole et al. 2004; Polyn et al. 2004).  In the proposed investigations, we will develop new methods for analysis of spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity in relation to two specific problems in fMRI data analysis:  1.  accounting for inter-individual variation in functional neuroanatomy, and 2.  the relation between spatially-distributed neural population responses and cognitive representations.  This work will involve the efforts of a multidisciplinary team consisting of cognitive neuroscientists, applied mathematicians, and signal- processing engineers.  We propose the development of analytic methods for aligning the functional neuroanatomy of individual brains based on the patterns of neural activity that are elicited by a broad spectrum of cognitive activities.  We predict that these methods will enhance the sensitivity of group statistical tests of fMRI data, will allow the investigation of the inter-individual consistency of higher spatial frequency topographic representations, and will provide explicit measures of inter-individual variation in the location, organization, and spatial extent of functional maps, with potential applications for studies of clinical conditions.  We propose, further, to develop methods for detecting and analyzing distributed patterns of neural activity that make use of prior knowledge about the structure of the cognitive representations that are associated with those neural activities.  We predict that these methods will increase the sensitivity of multi-voxel pattern analysis and will allow the investigation of how cognitive information is represented in topographically-organized, spatially-distributed patterns of neural activity.         n/a",Analysis of Multi-Voxel Patterns of Activity in fMRI data,7146469,R01MH075706,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'brain mapping', 'cerebral cortex', 'clinical research', 'cognition', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'face expression', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging', 'human subject', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuroimaging', 'statistics /biometry', 'three dimensional imaging /topography', 'videotape /videodisc', 'visual perception']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,329481,0.02504612234935215
"Testing a Model of Competitive Memory Retrieval    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Retrieval-induced forgetting is the forgetting of memories as a result of retrieving other, similar memories. Although retrieval-induced forgetting has been well characterized behaviorally, its neural mechanism is poorly understood. The proposed research uses electrophysiology in humans to monitor the brain activity that correlates with retrieval-induced forgetting. Pattern classification methods will be used to track the activation of memories during retrieval. The pattern of memory activation that leads to forgetting will be extracted using a subsequent forgetting analysis. Neural network simulations of retrieval-induced forgetting predict a specific pattern of memory activation relative to theta band oscillations. These predictions will be tested through examination of how the activation of the to-be-forgotten memories depends on theta phase. The proposed research will also refine the neural network model of retrieval-induced forgetting, by applying it to a hippocampal architecture, and by using more realistic forms of inhibition. Understanding the precise neural mechanisms that govern retrieval-induced forgetting will help us to gain better control over when forgetting occurs, which - in turn - should help us devise better treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (where more forgetting is desirable) and age-related memory disorders (where less forgetting is desirable).           n/a",Testing a Model of Competitive Memory Retrieval,7113431,F31MH077469,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'brain electrical activity', 'clinical research', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'electroencephalography', 'electrophysiology', 'hippocampus', 'human subject', 'long term memory', 'memory', 'memory disorders', 'neural information processing', 'neuropsychology', 'performance', 'predoctoral investigator', 'semantics', 'visual perception', 'vocabulary']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F31,2006,44657,0.033065049910623034
"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,7072822,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2006,197082,0.025677982679382025
"CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control Current technology allows the simultaneous recording from hundreds of cells in the brains of awake behaving animals. Using this information to understand how the brain represents and processes complex information is a fundamental scientific challenge with large practical benefits to human health. In particular this project will develop technologies for neural prostheses which promise a new generation of therapies for the severely disabled to allow them to regain the ability to interact with the world. To that end, the project has three specific aims: 1) New probabilistic models of the neural code will be developed that exploit machine learning methods (Gibbs learning and boosting) and high performance computing resources. These models will represent the high dimensional probabilistic relationship between multiple behavioral variables and the firing activity of a population of neurons. 2) Neural decoding methods will be developed that model the uncertainty in neural recordings to make sound inferences that can drive neural prostheses. As part of this effort new probabilistic spike sorting algorithms will be developed and tested. 3) Adaptation of cells in the brain will be studied using the statistical models developed here and an understanding of this adaptation will be used to design new algorithms for prosthetic applications. These algorithms will themselves be adaptive in a way that optimizes prosthetic control in the face of a changing neural code. To learn such models from vast amounts of neural data, a new class of mathematical and computational tools is required. An interdisciplinary team including computer scientists, applied mathematicians, and neuroscientists will work in close concert to exploit existing infrastructure and experience with neural prostheses to address fundamental problems necessary for the practical application of these devices in humans. The coupling between the prosthesis application and basic research on neural coding provides a tight cycle of hypothesis, development, testing, and validation that will impact public health. n/a",CRCNS: Learning the Neural Code for Prosthetic Control,7071223,R01NS050967,"['action potentials', 'animal data', 'behavior test', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electrodes', 'hippocampus', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'laboratory rat', 'limb movement', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'motor cortex', 'nervous system prosthesis', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry']",NINDS,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,346840,0.05655133588527824
"Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our understanding the physiology of human brain relies on the detailed description of the mapping between sensory stimuli and neural responses.  These mappings are complex as they involve non-linear transformations, dynamics, learning and adaptation, feedback and priors due to natural or learned constraints.  Inspired by recent advances in the field of machine learning, we will investigate the use of a series of algorithms that will allow us to characterize such complex mappings.  The algorithms represent modern improvements to the classical engineering systems analysis approach that could only be applied to the most peripheral stages of sensory processing.  These new algorithms use the power of modern computers to efficiently find the simplest set of functions that describe dynamical and non-linear mappings.  Our first two aims focus on development of parametric and non-parametric algorithms to characterize general stimulus response mappings.  The parametric models include explicit formulations of adaptive gain control and feedback.  The non-parametric models are estimated from the data using several algorithms, including maximally informative dimensions, neural network analyses, Lasso regression and kernel regression.  Our third aim is to develop methods to validate various models.  We also propose to make these tools available to the neuroscience community at large by incorporating them into STRFPAK, a software package (released during the previous award period and undergoing continuous improvement) for estimating receptive fields of sensory neurons.  Finally, we propose to develop a database that will serve as a repository for neuro-physiological data and analysis tools developed in the community.  The database will encourage the validation and distributions of data analysis methods.  The database will also provide experimental data to theorist and modelers of brain function.  The stimulus-response mapping algorithms developed under this proposal will provide neurobiologists with quantitative tools previously only available to specialists.  They therefore will have a direct benefit on basic research.  A thorough understanding of the complex stimulus-response mapping of sensory systems will also have significant benefits for several areas of medicine:  evaluation and diagnosis of disease states such as macular degeneration, and improvements in neural prosthetics such as hearing aids.  The computational mechanisms governing how the brain represents the sensory world are in many respects similar to those governing how the brain translates motor intention to motor action.  Therefore, application of these algorithms is also likely to lead to eventual improvements in neural prosthetics for motor control and action.       n/a",Quantitative Tools for Investigating Sensory Systems,7125904,R01MH066990,"['bioinformatics', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neurophysiology', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'statistics /biometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2006,36891,0.011139494415537628
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6857150,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,358050,0.042248329246600255

Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6899236,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'learning', 'light intensity', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory signal detection', 'visual feedback', 'visual perception', 'visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2005,201825,0.025677982679382025

"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals.

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6708002,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,358050,0.042248329246600255
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6740109,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior disorders', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'decision making', 'hippocampus', 'laboratory rat', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuronal guidance', 'neurons', 'neuropsychology', 'online computer', 'performance', 'short term memory', 'space perception', 'stimulus /response', 'temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,252000,0.06493133614287902

"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6639162,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2003,181110,0.03052620566521761

"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task.

"Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a series of coordinated computational and electrophysiological studies to identify, analyze, and implement contextual spike-timing codes in the encoding of light intensity, using a well-understood, simple visual system (the Hermissenda eye) that permits detailed cellular mechanistic analyses and biologically realistic, Hodgkin- Huxley level simulations. We further propose to examine mechanisms by which neural ""noise"" paradoxically improves, rather than degrades, light intensity encoding; and the interactions of contextual spike-timing codes with learning-related synaptic plasticity. Implementation experiments to restore network function by explicitly introducing contextual spike-timing relationships may provide powerful, novel evidence regarding the functional consequences of these codes. Specific Aim 1: Role of Network Architecture. Pilot simulation and physiological data indicate that network interactions (feed-forward, feedback, and lateral inhibition) alter contextual spike-timing relationships and may contribute substantially to improved information processing in the network, relative to single cells. We will examine the existence, origins, and consequences of these codes in both the simulated and biological eye. Specific Aim 2: Encoding of Light Intensity. Preliminary evidence indicates that an increase in light intensity produces an increase in both the rate and synchrony of type A photoreceptor spiking, suggesting multiple encoding schemes with potentially complementary roles. Further, the addition of synaptic and ionic neural ""noise"" improves both rate and synchrony encoding of light intensity. We propose to quantify and compare rate and contextual spike-timing codes across light intensities; examine how their performance is affected by the presence of neural noise; and implement relevant algorithms into a neural interface (or simulated interface) to determine whether they improve control of the system and light intensity encoding. Specific Aim 3: Contextual Spike-Timing Codes and Learning. Preliminary data indicate that synaptic facilitation at B-to-A connections alters the timing relationships between these photoreceptors, and that noise improves rather than degrades the reliability of type A cell responses to enhanced synaptic input. We propose to examine the role of learning-related synaptic plasticity in contextual spike timing encoding, including its effects on light intensity coding and mechanisms of noise-induced enhancements. Taken together, these studies will elucidate neurobiological strategies for information processing, and identify efficient bio-based solutions that may be advantageously incorporated into artificial intelligence systems, robotic systems, or clinical neuroprostheses.         n/a",Contextual Spike-Timing Codes in Sensory Processing,6671314,R01MH068392,"['Hermissenda', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' learning', ' light intensity', ' neural information processing', ' neural transmission', ' sensory discrimination', ' sensory signal detection', ' visual feedback', ' visual perception', ' visual photoreceptor']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2003,229705,0.025677982679382025
"Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of Non-Synaptic Epileptiform Activity,6529645,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,229500,0.020847429558600722
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6539073,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2002,217428,0.03052620566521761
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6516620,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,358050,0.042248329246600255

"Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epilepsy is characterized by the abnormal       synchronization of large numbers of neurons. The synchronization and                 propagation of epileptic seizures are thought to rely on synaptic transmission.      However, non-synaptic mechanisms such as neuronal swelling, electric field           effects, potassium diffusion, gap junctions and glial cell function also             contribute to the generation and spread of epileptiform activity. Non-synaptic       epilepsy is generated by lowering calcium in the extracellular space thereby         eliminating synaptic transmission. As a result, the clinical relevance of            non-synaptic mechanisms has been questioned. We have recently generated novel        models of non-synaptic activity in the presence of normal calcium and normal         synaptic transmission. We propose to analyze the role of non-synaptic                mechanisms in neuronal synchronization in order to understand and potentially        develop novel therapies to prevent abnormal neural activity. We have recently        shown that the frequency, amplitude and duration of non-synaptic epileptiform        events can be controlled independently suggesting that different mechanisms are      responsible. In particular, preliminary experiments show that gap junctions are      not responsible for the propagation of non-synaptic events generated in              zero-calcium medium, but that potassium diffusion (potentially mediated by the       activity of glial cells) plays a crucial role. The goal of this proposal is to       analyze and control non-synaptic epileptiform activity.                                                                                                                   Specifically, we propose to 1) determine the common mechanisms underlying three      models of non-synaptic epilepsy, 2) establish the conditions sufficient for the      generation of non-synaptic epileptogenesis, 3) analyze the mechanisms                underlying the propagation of non-synaptic epileptiform activity, 4) develop a       computer model of non-synaptic propagation to test hypotheses not directly           testable by experimentation, and 5) develop methods for controlling                  epileptiform activity. Multi-disciplinary experimental approaches such as            computer simulation and fluorescence imaging will be combined with pharmacology      and in-vitro slice electrophysiology to achieve these goals. Current                 therapeutic agents are not capable of controlling seizure activity in 25             percent of all epileptic patients. The results of our studies should provide         valuable insight into mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis as well as new           tools for the control and suppression of epileptic seizures.                                                                                                              n/a",Analysis & Control of NonSynaptic Epileptiform Activity,6383308,R01NS040785,"['Animalia', ' artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' cadmium', ' calcium', ' calcium channel', ' computer simulation', ' epilepsy', ' gap junctions', ' hippocampus', ' magnesium', ' model design /development', ' neuropharmacology', ' veratrum alkaloid', ' voltage /patch clamp']",NINDS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,224388,0.021224826817064436
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6495247,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2001,37627,0.032614221525905256

This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6391354,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2001,99063,0.01411705793537103
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6392748,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2001,217905,0.03052620566521761
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6331594,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,358050,0.042248329246600255

The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6392795,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2001,123541,0.061266046516571346
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus.

"NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES The PI is a Neurophysiologist and Pediatric Neurosurgeon who will be the         Associate Director of Center V (Behavioral and Neurobiology Research), with      special responsibility for Neurobiology programs, at the Children""s              Research Institute.  This RCA will permit the PI to devote nearly full time      to research.                                                                                                                                                      Short term goals are to test the hypothesis that neuronal ensembles have         nonlinear deterministic properties.  If so, they will 1) have activity that      can be characterized and controlled through unstable periodic orbits, 2)         hen noise driven will exhibit stochastic resonance, and 3) because of            coupling will exhibit generalized (nonlinear) synchrony and emergence.           Long-term goals are to achieve a better understanding of neuronal network        and brain behavior, and to develop novel methods of treating dynamical           diseases.                                                                                                                                                         The research project will involve theoretical work on the detection of           unstable orbits in In Vitro brain slices and human epileptic foci.  Such         orbit information forms a novel method of characterizing the deterministic       properties of complex systems despite nonstationarity, and can be used to        control those systems.  Nonlinear systems also optimize their response to        weak signals in the presence of noise - stochastic resonance.  We will           define the statistical mechanics of stochastic resonance through                 simultaneous measurements of single neuron and neuronal ensemble activity.       Since neuronal ensembles may demonstrate nonlinear generalized synchrony,        we will quantify spatio-temporal generalized synchrony through dual              simultaneous single cell recordings as a function of separation in a             neuronal network.  Both unstable orbit detection and generalized synchrony       will be used to define the emergence of nonlinear behaviors in neuronal          ensembles.                                                                                                                                                        The results of this research will fundamentally alter the way that neuronal      dynamics can be characterized and controlled, will provide a means to deal       with neuronal nonstationarity, will further explain the role of noise in         the nervous system, and may provide a novel approach for the control of          pathological neuronal ensembles in dynamical diseases such as epilepsy,          spasticity, and tremor.                                                           n/a",NONLINEAR DYNAMICS OF NEURONAL ENSEMBLES,6185560,K02MH001493,"['artificial intelligence', ' brain electrical activity', ' computational neuroscience', ' electric field', ' electroencephalography', ' extracellular', ' hippocampus', ' human data', ' intracellular', ' laboratory rat', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neurons', ' neurosurgery', ' noise', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY,K02,2000,99063,0.01411705793537103
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6174750,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2000,154327,0.032614221525905256
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6086079,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2000,212691,0.03052620566521761
"STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              This is an application for a KO2 Independent Scientist Award. The candidate is       an anesthesiologist/statistician whose research to date has focused on the           development of statistical models for the quantitative study of how neural           systems represent and transmit information the central focus of his career           research. The study of how neural systems encode information is one of the most      challenging and fascinating problems in science. The point process character of      neural spike trains means that standard signal processing techniques developed       to analyze continuous signals will have limited application in the analysis of       neural systems. The study of neural signal processing requires the development       of new quantitative techniques to accurately characterize the properties of          neural systems. These methods should be developed in close collaboration with        experimentalists to ensure that the models remain completely faithful to the         neurophysiology. For this reason, the candidate will collaborate with Professor      Matt Wilson in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT. The             research will use Professor Wilson's paradigm of simultaneous multiunit              recordings of pyramidal (place) cells in the hippocampus of freely behaving          rodents to model, how these neurons encode spatial information as the animals        perform specific behavioral tasks. The statistical methods to be developed will      be based on spatio-temporal point process models of hippocampal place cell           spiking activity and nonlinear recursive filtering algorithms based on Bayesian      statistical theory. The experimental work in this project will be carried out        in Professor Wilson's laboratory at MIT and is an integral part of his research      on characterizing the role of the hippocampus in short- and long-term memory         formation. The methodology research will be conducted in parallel at the             candidate's laboratory in the Department of Anesthesia at Massachusetts General      Hospital. The candidate will use the additional funded research time provided        by KO2 award to enhance his knowledge of hippocampus physiology and anatomy and      to develop a sound theoretical framework based on theory of point processes          from which to derive signal processing methods appropriate for neural systems.       The candidate's long-term objectives are to continue his work on neural              information processing and the study of the hippocampus in memory formation.         The research to be undertaken in this project will also provide a set of             statistical tools with which neuroscientists will be able to study information       representation and transmission in neural systems using multiunit activity data      recorded along with relevant biological signals.                                                                                                                          n/a",STATISTICAL MODELING OF NEURAL INFORMATION ENCODING,6090371,K02MH061637,"['NMDA receptors', ' action potentials', ' animal data', ' artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' computational neuroscience', ' electroencephalography', ' entorhinal cortex', ' environment', ' hippocampus', ' long term memory', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' pyramidal cells', ' short term memory', ' sleep', ' space perception', ' statistics /biometry']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K02,2000,123541,0.061266046516571346
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus.

"Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior Implantable devices are playing a greater role in neurologic care, but their effectiveness is limited, because they are blind to human thoughts, feelings, and behavior – factors that most dramatically affect our health. Coupling peripheral sensors to implants might help, but wouldn’t it be easier if the devices just asked us? Armed with this knowledge, next generation machines will more effectively drive neural activity in the brain to healthy states. They will also quickly learn behaviors that worsen health and guide us to better choices. Though DARPA, the NIH, and Neuralink are spending millions of dollars on new hardware for brain-computer interfaces, none focus on reciprocal, natural communication between host and machine. There is a desperate need for novel, practical methods that enable devices to learn from and guide human behavior.  In this application I propose to develop a new generation of autonomous brain-machine interfaces – devices that can question, record, act - and combine learning algorithms applied to neurosignals with teaching by their human hosts. Life with these implants will entail a subtle human- machine dialogue in which devices and humans teach and learn from each other. Humans will inform intelligent algorithms about what we are doing and feeling, while machines will incorporate this information into therapy and guide us to optimize quality of life in personalized ways. This is a paradigm shift from today’s simple devices, which are programmed by physicians during occasional office visits. I propose to demonstrate this paradigm in a practical, scalable way using current epilepsy implants that is rapidly translatable to many neurological disorders.  To achieve this goal, I will meld several cutting-edge technologies in novel ways, including: (1) State-of-the-art, high bandwidth implantables that sample neural activity, link to vast cloud- based computational power to process it, and intervene to modulate brain, spinal cord or peripheral neural activity. This work utilizes my experience from the past 20 years; (2) I will deploy powerful new computer science tools in novel ways. I will use convolutional neural nets (a.k.a. Deep Learning) to learn patterns from vast streams of continuous high-bandwidth neural data, build a two way human-machine interface using Natural Language Processing (NLP)., and probe networks with changes in human behavior and electrical stimulation and guide interventions toward therapeutic goals using Reinforcement Learning. Combining these computer science, machine learning techniques and measurements of human behavior is a new area of investigation for me that will leverage my unique background in clinical neurology and engineering to build a new class of interactive, human therapeutic devices. The goal of this project is to develop a revolutionary, new generation of implantable neurodevices that will communicate with, learn from, and teach their human hosts to better treat disease. Current implantable devices are blind to human actions, thoughts and behavior, which limits their effectiveness. State of the art computer techniques that can measure behavior and link them to brain activity will empower patients to teach, control and learn from their devices to improve health and quality of life.","Ghost in the Machine: Melding Brain, Computer and Behavior",10012013,DP1NS122038,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Feeling', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Office Visits', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'blind', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learned behavior', 'learning algorithm', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,DP1,2020,1134000,0.012303740015003601
"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,6000000,-0.0028089902212926655
"A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States Project Summary Advances in neural recording technology now provide access to neural activity at high temporal resolutions, from many brain areas, and during complex and naturalistic behavior. Interpreting these types of high-dimensional and unconstrained neural recordings is still a major challenge in neuroscience. The aim of this project is to develop innovative methods for distilling high-dimensional neural activity patterns into simpler low-dimensional formats that can be effectively compared across time, conditions, or even across species. Our team is uniquely positioned to not only develop these novel methods, but also apply them to characterize changes in neural systems across a wide range of clinically-relevant perturbations, including addiction, sensory manipulation, and disease. In this project, theory, methods, and models will be developed for: 1) learning low-dimensional latent space models that align many neural datasets onto a common reference frame for comparison, 2) comparing datasets and testing the impact of a variety of perturbations (e.g. monocular deprivation, addiction and withdrawal) on the shape or geometry of neural activity from its baseline state, and 3) investigating the role of specific cell types and microcircuits on shaping population activity over time, during sleep, and in response to certain classes of perturbations. This project will provide new tools and frameworks for comparing neural datasets, leading to robust measures of disease, signatures of addiction, and other network-level reflections of environment and behavior. Significance: As neural datasets continue to grow in size, new methods for analysis are becoming of utmost importance in driving scientific understanding of the brain. The methods developed in this proposal will identify new ways to learn network-level signatures that allow us to link and compare different neural activity patterns. A robust ability to compare activity across time and animals will have wide reaching impacts, and provide new tools to advance network-level understanding of disease. Innovation: This project will leverage state-of-the-art approaches in high-dimensional statistics and geometry, which are simultaneously advancing in the context of deep learning (DL) architectures, and to tackle challenges in neural coding. This project represents a truly innovative combination of tools in machine learning and computational neuroscience which will likely transfer knowledge in both directions: from machine learning to neuroscience and back. The unique application of advanced mathematical tools in geometry and optimization to population-level analysis of perturbations will be transformative, not only for neuroscience but also in the study of DL architectures. Project Narrative Interpreting patterns of activity across large networks of neurons is an incredibly challenging problem that remains a key objective of the BRAIN initiative. This project will develop transformative methods for distilling neural activity patterns into compact, informative representations that facilitate comparison across datasets from different brain areas and multiple time-scales, and at different states of neurological disease.",A Comparative Framework for Modeling the Low-Dimensional Geometry of Neural Population States,10007243,R01EB029852,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'deprivation', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'monocular deprivation', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,1000000,0.050717003930983176
"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10037486,R01MH123612,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reciprocal Social Interaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'body position', 'collaborative approach', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social defeat', 'social structure', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,416250,-0.0047648142858781745
"Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates 7: Project Summary/Abstract Marmosets are emerging as an important model species for neuroscience research, driven by the development of new technologies such as CRISPR that allow targeted genetic modifications in this species. These developments will allow primate research to take advantage of powerful genetic tools that were previously restricted largely to rodents, including optogenetics, genetic activity reporters, and targeted mutation of endogenous genes implicated in brain function and human disease. Marmosets are well suited to this approach, being small and fast-breeding compared to most primates. They are typically housed in family groups, and exhibit a variety of social behaviors in captivity including complex vocal repertoires. Marmosets thus represent a promising system for studying social behavior and other cognitive functions in a primate model, and they also hold great promise for modeling brain disorders that affect cognitive functions that are difficult to study in other species such as rodents. To take full advantage of these emerging animal models, it is necessary to develop new methods for analyzing their behavior, including naturalistic social interactions that are imperfectly captured by standardized behavioral tasks. We therefore plan to develop a system for automated analysis of marmoset behaviors in the home cage. The system will consist of an integrated array of sensors including video cameras, depth sensors, and collar-mounted wearable microphones. The resulting multimodal data will be synchronized and analyzed using methods from computer vision, speech processing, machine learning, and multimodal data analysis. Specifically we will formulate the tracking analysis as a probabilistic graphical model, which will allow video data to be integrated with audio recordings, and with other modalities that could be explored in future, including inertial motion sensors, physiological recordings and other contextual data. Based on this approach we will develop methods to classify calls, identify individual callers, track the locations and identities of each animal in three dimensions, and classify different actions, including interactions between individuals. We envisage that our system will be useful for a wide range of studies in basic and translational neuroscience, and in particular it will be useful for studying behavioral phenotypes in genetic models of human psychiatric disorders, and for relating behavioral abnormalities to their underlying genetic and neural causes. 8: Project Narrative: We propose to develop an automated system for monitoring the behavior of marmosets in the home cage environment. The proposed system will measure a wide range of naturalistic behaviors including vocal and social interactions, and will be useful for studying animal models of psychiatric disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, in which these behaviors are disrupted. This in turn will allow researchers to relate behavioral abnormalities to their underlying neural and genetic causes, an essential step toward the understanding and eventual treatment of these disorders.",Development of an Integrated System for Monitoring Home-Cage Behavior in Non-Human Primates,9901577,R01MH111916,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breeding', 'Callithrix', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Head', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Language Development', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Primates', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sleep', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'data streams', 'feeding', 'gaze', 'human disease', 'human model', 'limb movement', 'machine learning method', 'microphone', 'motion sensor', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'offspring', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'speech processing', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'vibration', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,521954,0.006816511620889911
"Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain. Project Summary The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL, called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals. This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes. Narrative Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, anhedonia, apathy, schizophrenia, addiction, eating disorders and Parkinson’s disease. In particular, aberrant dopamine responses to salient events have been implicated in addiction, schizophrenia and other mental disorders. Understanding dopamine signaling in the healthy brain is essential to understanding states of aberrant dopamine signaling.",Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain.,9978224,R01NS116753,"['Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Eating Disorders', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rewards', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'artificial neural network', 'classical conditioning', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning algorithm', 'network architecture', 'neuromechanism', 'optimism', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1162348,-0.005965933702652218
"Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit Work on learning in neural systems has focused largely on the effects of plasticity at synapses that provide direct input to the neurons being studied. Learning a model of the environment or a complex skill, however, relies on plasticity that is widely distributed and may occur at synapses far from the neurons driving decisions or actions. As is well-known from multi-layer (or 'deep') artificial networks, distributing learning over multiple layers is substantially more powerful but also more difficult to implement than learning at a single layer. The fact that computer scientists have solved such problems has revolutionized artificial intelligence and is rapidly reshaping the human world. Understanding how the brain solves such problems is, undoubtedly, one of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience today. However, progress along these lines has been slow, due in part to the high degree of complexity of learning and memory circuits in mammals, such as hippocampus and neocortex, that have been a major focus of research. This proposal applies integrated experimental and theoretical approaches to a system with unique advantages for understanding learning in multi-layer networks. The electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish is the site of a continual learning process that predicts and cancels self-generated sensory input in order to enhance detection of behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Building on this knowledge, we propose to develop a model of the ELL spanning from cellular biophysics to network dynamics with the goal of explaining how synaptic plasticity widely distributed across processing layers and cell types gives rise to learning. To accomplish this, we will leverage cutting-edge approaches for mapping synaptic connectivity at high-resolution and monitoring neural population activity over the entire time course of learning. The proposed research is expected to yield general insight into how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. This proposal seeks to understand how sophisticated forms of learning are implemented in neural circuits. To do this we will apply cutting-edge approaches for measuring activity in neuronal populations, mapping circuitry at high-resolution, and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system—the weakly electric mormryid fish. The research will produce a detailed computational model, spanning from biophysical to network levels, of how learning arises from synaptic plasticity that is widely distributed across processing layers and cell types.",Understanding Multi-Layer Learning in a Biological Circuit,10053457,R01NS118448,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysical Process', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Fishes', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mormyridae', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'experience', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory input', 'skills']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1521512,0.033297039043963896
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,9874435,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2020,235500,0.027499890187985876
"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,9952827,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,136242,0.01225612939705555
"Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila. Project Summary/Abstract There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of how complex, multi-action, behavioral variability is generated by neural circuits in the brain. Understanding this process is crucial to understanding how many neurological diseases cause restricted and inappropriate selection of actions. The goal of this proposal is to understand how populations of neurons control the behavioral variability in action selection for complex behaviors. We will utilize the fruit fly to investigate this question because despite having a much simpler brain than humans, the fruit fly performs complex behaviors with high variability. We have found that activating just 24 neurons in the fruit fly brain causes variable expression of four distinct aggressive actions: stopping, wing elevation, leg extension, and lunging. The relative simplicity of this system is ideal for pin-pointing the contribution of different sources of variability: cell-autonomous stochasticity in action potential generation, variability at a network-level or variability in muscles or other neurons affected by the 24 neurons. To test these sources for variability, the project will consist of three main aims. The first is to determine whether the actions are discrete states of behavior or lie within a continuum by using advances in machine learning and neuroethology to automate the identification of the aggressive behavioral actions and the transitions between these actions. The second is to test the hypothesis that each action is caused by neurons with similar neuroanatomical connections using neuroimaging, genetic manipulation, and controlled behavioral experiments. The third is to use functional imaging, in vivo electrophysiological recordings, and computational modeling to determine the neural basis for the variability of behavior. By combining theory, experimentation, and modeling, we will be able to provide a systems level explanation of the logic behind why animals perform different actions despite consistent levels of neuronal activation. Project Narrative The ability to flexibly and appropriately perform action selection is altered in many neurological and psychiatric diseases. However, the mechanism behind the variability in action selection while performing complex behaviors is not understood. By quantifying, modeling, and decoding the neural logic behind the variability in action selection of a fruit fly, we aim to build new theories about how our own brain works and provide insight into better treatment of diseases affecting proper execution of behaviors.",Decoding the neural mechanism underlying variable action selection in Drosophila.,10157174,F31NS120835,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Functional Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Leg', 'Light', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Video Recording', 'Wing', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'insight', 'male', 'markov model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroethology', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'peanut butter', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory integration', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.026982171596018945
"Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema The goal of this proposed research is to reveal the sensory origins underlying the body schema representation. Body schema is the brain's internal model of the body's spatial configuration. This internal representation is critical for sensorimotor processing, movement control, and self-awareness, and is continuously updated during movement. Body schema representations are disrupted when somatosensory input is lost. The first step toward discover the neural correlates of body schema is to uncover neural mechanisms that generate body posture representation. We hypothesize that sensory inputs from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) are transformed to construct a body posture representation.  To delineate the mechanisms underlying the neural coding of body posture, this project will utilize large- scale monitoring, apply interventional tools, develop new data analysis tools, and integrate new approaches. Our approach is to perform large-scale electrophysiological recording and novel markerless tracking of 3D posture in freely moving mice. To track posture, the first aim is to adapt a markerless tracking pipeline comprised of a deep 3D convolutional neural network to process high-speed videography of mouse behavior from multiple cameras. The second aim is to perform large-scale recording of neurons in S1, S2, and PPC and use advanced computational approaches to determine which postural features best explain the activity of neurons in these cortical areas. Finally, the third aim is to use optogenetic and projection-specific manipulations to address the causal impact of proprioceptive inputs from S1 and S2 on coding of posture in PPC. This research promises to uncover how sensory inputs are involved in generating the body schema representation and guiding behavior.  Extensive training will be required to carry out this project and achieve my goal of earning a tenure-track professor position. The rigorous methodological and intellectual environment in Dr. Fan Wang’s lab and the Duke Neurobiology community will advance my conceptual knowledge and technical skills. I will implement deep learning techniques through training and collaboration with specialists. I will learn new techniques by attending Neuropixel and computational neuroscience courses. Finally, I will develop my professional skills by frequent attendance of seminars, workshops, and meeting with a postdoctoral mentorship committee.  The proposed project will be conducted in the Department of Neurobiology at the Duke University Medical Campus. This interdisciplinary community at Duke will bolster the research and training included in this application through frequent interaction with talented and collaborative faculty, organization of seminars and symposia, numerous opportunities to practice research talks and receive valuable feedback, formation of a personalized postdoctoral mentorship committee, extensive career and professional training, and invaluable support from the postdoctoral association. Project Narrative Body schema, the brain’s internal model of the spatial configuration of its body parts, is normally updated during movement, but can be disrupted following amputation, stroke, or deafferentation. Understanding how neural circuits generate body schema representation in health and disease could pave the way for improvements in surgical practice, stroke recovery therapy, brain-machine interface technology, and prosthetic limb engineering. Furthermore, sustaining an internal model of the body is a key element of awareness of one’s own body and the body of others, so findings on the sensory origins underlying body schema will have implications ranging from sensorimotor processing, motor control, interpersonal representations, and social cognition.",Markerless Tracking of 3D Posture to Reveal the Sensory Origins of Body Schema,9987939,F32MH122995,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amputation', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data Analyses', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Experimental Models', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Self Perception', 'Sensory', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Talents', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'meetings', 'motor control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'research to practice', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social cognition', 'somatosensory', 'stroke recovery', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,37289,-0.010350236630449747
"Computational, Neural, and Behavioral Studies of Competition-Dependent Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Our overarching goal is to understanding how stored memories change as a function of experience. The pro- posed work builds on prior research showing a U-shaped relationship between memory activation and learn- ing, whereby strong activation leads to synaptic strengthening, moderate activation leads to synaptic weaken- ing, and no activation leads to no change in synaptic strength. The present grant focuses on the implications of this U-shaped relationship for representational change: Learning is not just about making memories stronger or weaker—it can also decrease neural overlap between memories (differentiation) or increase neural overlap (integration). These neural changes can have profound effects on memory retrieval: Decreased overlap can reduce interference, at the cost of preventing generalization. Our specific goal is to construct and test a com- putational model of representational change and how it is shaped by competitive neural dynamics. When im- plemented in neural networks that are capable of self-organizing internal representations, our theory makes clear, novel predictions about when differentiation and integration will occur: Differentiation of memories A and B will occur when (i) B is moderately activated while processing A, causing weakening of connections between B and A, and (ii) B is reactivated later, allowing it to acquire new features that do not overlap with A; by con- trast, integration will occur if B is strongly activated during A, causing strengthening of connections between B and A. Aim 1 will use neural network simulations to address vexing puzzles in the literature and to generate novel empirical predictions. Aim 2 will test these predictions using behavioral and fMRI experiments focused on learning of new associations in the hippocampus, with a particular emphasis on testing the model's predic- tions about how competitive dynamics relate to representational change. Aim 3 will test the model's predictions regarding cortical plasticity, using a novel sketching task that induces competition between representations of familiar objects. Representational change will be assessed behaviorally in terms of how sketches and object recognition change over learning and neurally using fMRI of visual cortex; a deep neural network model of the ventral stream will be used to measure changes in the features of sketches. In summary: The proposed studies use multiple innovative approaches (fMRI pattern analysis, neural network modeling, free-form object sketching, and computer vision) to address the fundamental question of when experience causes neural repre- sentations to differentiate or integrate, thereby advancing our basic understanding of neuroplasticity. Improving our understanding of neural differentiation could have transformative implications for treating cognitive deficits in a wide range of clinical conditions, including stroke, dyslexia, and dementia. In all of these conditions, cogni- tive deficits can arise from insufficient separation of representations. This research may lead to better ways of re-differentiating these representations and—through this—ameliorating the associated cognitive deficits.

"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,-0.0016944489161712403
"Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior ABSTRACT Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain. Exploratory behaviors are necessary for rodent survival in the natural world and ubiquitous in freely-moving rodent experiments. One neural circuit that may mediate natural exploratory behaviors are the projections from prelimbic cortex (PL, part of rodent prefrontal cortex) to ventral tegmental area (VTA). Stimulation of PL-VTA projections causes increased velocity but is not rewarding, despite the well-known rewarding effect of direct stimulation of VTA-dopamine neurons. Taken together with the fact that VTA has been implicated in exploration, my central hypothesis is that PL-VTA neurons mediate natural exploratory behaviors through downstream effects on a subpopulation of non-dopaminergic VTA neurons. To investigate this hypothesis, I will first develop an unbiased, machine-learning-based method to quantify untrained, freely-moving mouse behaviors (Experiment 1.1). My method will leverage multi-view, high resolution video, supervised body part tracking, and unsupervised machine learning-based postural clustering methods. I will use this method to identify which specific behaviors (rearing, walking, grooming, sniffing, etc.) are affected by optogenetic stimulation or inhibition of PL-VTA cells in the presence and absence of rewards (Experiment 1.2). Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of my behavioral quantification method and suggests that PL-VTA stimulation increases exploratory behaviors. Next, to identify the genetically- and target-defined VTA cells that are preferentially synapsed onto by PL projections, I will use a combination of optogenetics, in vitro electrophysiology, transgenic mice, and retrograde tracing. First, I will use transgenic mice to measure the functional strength of PL input specifically onto VTA cells that are dopaminergic, GABAergic, or glutamatergic (Experiment 2.1). In a different set of mice, I will use retrograde tracing to identify if PL synapses preferentially onto VTA cells that project to nucleus accumbens or amygdala (Experiment 2.2). After learning which genetic and target-defined VTA subpopulations receive PL input, I will use retrograde tracing in combination with transgenic labeling to identify specifically which genetically and projection-defined VTA subpopulation receives PL input (Experiment 2.3). Finally, I will use a retrograde cre-dependent virus to selectively infect this VTA subpopulation with ChR2 and use my behavioral quantification pipeline to investigate whether in vivo stimulation of this subpopulation recapitulates the exploratory effects of PL-VTA stimulation (Experiment 2.4). Thus, the project proposed will develop a novel method for quantifying naturalistic behavior and integrate this computational method with diverse experimental methods, including in vivo and in vitro optogenetics, natural behavior, and synaptic physiology. These experiments will contribute novel information on how the PL-VTA circuit mediates naturalistic motor output, independent of the reinforcement effects of VTA-dopamine activity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Investigating how neural circuits mediate natural behavior is a critical to our understanding of the brain, but until recently methods for quantifying spontaneous behavior have been limited. I will develop a novel computational method for assessing how naturalistic exploratory behaviors are mediated by a subset of prefrontal cortex cells and the midbrain cells onto which they synapse. In total, this project will combine computational and experimental methods to map prefrontal-midbrain circuit and identify its effects on natural exploratory behavior.",Defining the role of a prefrontal-midbrain circuit in exploratory behavior,10146550,F32MH125546,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Dopaminergic Cell', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Motor output', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Stimulus', 'Supervision', 'Synapses', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Walking', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cell cortex', 'cell type', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69926,0.024762304463458007
"Neural representation of the geometry and functionality in a scene ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of the proposed research is to investigate how the brain represents scene geometry and functionality. Recognizing the visual environment is central to our daily interactions with the world. When we walk into a new space, we rapidly recognize whether there is a path to follow, whether there are crossable boundaries, and whether there are obstacles that block our view and potential navigation. The theoretical framework of this proposal is based on evidence that there are distinct but complementary levels of scene representation across a group of scene-selective regions in the brain (Park et al., 2011; Park et al., 2014; Park & Chun, 2009; Park, Chun, & Johnson, 2010; Park, Intraub, Yi, Widders, & Chun, 2007). The PI proposes that scene geometry (e.g., spatial layout, three-dimensional scene boundary) and functionality (e.g., navigability, limitations of a boundary) are two fundamental scene properties represented in these regions. Specific Aims: Aim 1 investigates whether the brain displays acute sensitivity to the presence of vertical boundaries, and how such sensitivity is modulated by the functional impediment that a boundary presents to the viewer's potential navigation. Aim 2 investigates the neural representation of the scene navigability, and how this representation differs from representation of scene geometry. Aim 3 investigates whether the neural representation of real world scenes is modulated by acquired knowledge about the spatio-temporal context of a scene, which are important for functionality of a scene. Throughout her aims, the PI tests medial temporal lobe regions in human adults that process scene and spatial information: with particular focus on anterior and posterior parahippocampal gyri and retrosplenial cortex. Methods include univariate and multi-voxel fMRI pattern analyses (linear support vector machine classification and representational similarity analysis) in combination with both region-of-interest (ROI) based and whole-brain based (search light) approaches. Hypothesis and preliminary results throughout the proposal suggest that scene geometry is represented in the parahippocampal gyrus, while scene functionality is represented in the retrosplenial cortex.

"CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the  brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the  present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable  Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s  sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant  computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis  tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The  monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop  predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are  fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.  They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to  allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for  their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The  results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task  in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain computations. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial  navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm  for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain  either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding  and improving disrupted human cognitive function. n/a",CRCNS: Neural computations for continuous control in virtual reality foraging,10146521,R01NS120407,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Fireflies', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Incentives', 'Instruction', 'Juice', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Output', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathologic', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Utah', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'way finding']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,423814,0.04183476490975507
"Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue Abstract  How is connectivity between neurons related to patterns of activity exhibited by these neurons in vivo? This question of structure-function relations in brain circuits is of fundamental importance. Answering it in a quantitative manner would have far-reaching consequences both for our theories of how brain works and for applications ranging from better disease treatments to new tools for artificial intelligence. However, our current understanding of structure-function relations is relatively poor, in large part because the fine structure of neuronal connectivity has remained largely unknown. In turn, this severely limits connecting modeling to theoretical efforts. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of studying the highly heterogeneous cortical circuits, which are involved in important functions like perception, cognition, and learning.  Fortunately, recent experimental work by our collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science is now resulting in transformational new datasets that characterize connectivity in the mouse cortical area V1 at the level of Cell Types using multi-patch synaptic physiology and at the level of individual neurons using electron microscopy (EM). For the first time in history of neuroscience, we will have connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in ~1 mm3 of V1, plus systematic characterization of synaptic properties.  We will leverage these unique datasets to build and share with the community new models of V1 and use them to study the relationships between cortical connectivity and in vivo activity and computations. We will analyze how multiple features of neuronal code depend on individual cell properties and on higher-order connectivity motifs, which are present in the EM connectome, but not in the statistics-based connectivity inferred from sparse measurements at the Cell Types level or from existing literature. We also will evaluate the consistency of the new models of V1 with predictions made by current theories of structure-function relations.  These models and simulations will be freely shared with the community as a resource that scientists will use to guide future experiment designs, improve biological realism in models, and assist in generating and testing theories. By providing a rich and biologically realistic framework for new theoretical, modeling, and experimental studies, this resource will fuel new discoveries regarding relations between the structure and function of cortical circuits. To improve our understanding of the healthy brain as well as what breaks down in disease, it is essential to develop a quantitative, mechanistic description of how properties of neurons and their connections determine the properties of neural activity in vivo. This project will take advantage of unprecedented experimental datasets from the Allen Institute for Brain Science that contain a systematic characterization of synaptic connections between the cell types present and a connectome of individual neurons coupled with dense recordings of activity in the mouse visual cortex. We propose to integrate these data into new, highly realistic network models of cortical circuits, use the models to explore theoretical predictions, and provide them as a resource to fuel future theoretical, modeling, and experimental work in the community.",Modeling the structure-function relation in a reconstructed cortical tissue,10005712,R01EB029813,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiology', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'base', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'models and simulation', 'network models', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,ALLEN INSTITUTE,R01,2020,600000,0.01012058450357796
"Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans PROJECT SUMMARY A diverse range of behaviors including language, event segmentation, and learning to play an instrument involve parsing complex temporal sequences. Item co-occurrence in a sequence can exist between pairs of items shown consecutively, as well as triplets, quadruplets and other higher order sets. For example, when learning a language both humans and natural language processing algorithms make use of first order statistics about which words tend to follow others, and higher-order statistics about the grammar of sentences and paragraphs. The statistics of this co-occurrence between sets of different sizes can influence how well people learn the sequence. We can demonstrate this learning by presenting stimuli in a sequence determined by a walk on a highly clustered graph where stimuli within a large cluster tend to co-occur more frequently than stimuli in different clusters. When subjects are shown motor cues generated from a walk on such a graph, they exhibit shorter reaction times and more similar BOLD activity for successive cues drawn from the same cluster than when they are drawn from different clusters. Generalizable theories of hippocampal function suggest that its role in learning and predicting abstract relationships could subserve this behavior. In line with this theory, neuroimaging data implicates the hippocampus and downstream cortical regions in this behavior. However, direct electrophysiological measures of neural activity during the performance of this task have not been examined, leaving the description of the neural underpinnings of the behavior incomplete. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that activity in the hippocampus reflects behavioral change across clusters, and is sensitive to higher-order associations between stimuli. Our investigation is an important next step in testing theories of how the hippocampus aids relational learning, and it will add to knowledge of how information in the world is represented in the brain and how it aids or hinders learning. PROJECT NARATIVE Identifying complex relationships between items in a sequence is a crucial component of learning in humans, and is thought to rely on activity in the hippocampus. However, the neural substrates that allow humans to learn higher-order statistics among stimuli in a sequence have not been fully explored, greatly limiting our understanding of sequential information encoding in the brain. We propose to use electrocorticography (ECoG) to test the hypothesis that hippocampal activity reflects these complex relationships between items, and tracks behavioral changes that demonstrate learning.",Investigating the neurophysiological underpinnings of higher-order statistical learning in humans,9991400,F31MH120925,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Distant', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Encapsulated', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Quadruplet Multiple Birth', 'Reaction Time', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Walking', 'discounting', 'instrument', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sequence learning', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories', 'way finding']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,0.003991235508690223
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,9995591,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,327626,0.020971990954987366
"Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics Project Summary  Major depressive disorder (MDD) and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, with health spending on treatment recently exceeding $71 billion per year. It is now well established that MDD represents a spectrum of disorders, but current drug based approaches to treatment are temporally nonselective, and their efficacy varies highly across individuals. In this proposal, we explore a ​novel individualized intervention strategy,​ wherein we aim to prevent and reverse MDD through closed-loop behavioral and neural circuit “tuning”.  While some individuals develop MDD as a result of a stressful life event, other individuals appear more resilient to stress-induced depression. Our goal in this proposal is to leverage recent advances in machine learning to identify and detect specific pro-resilient behaviors and patterns of activation in resilient individuals, and then use these data to “steer” susceptible individuals into pro-resilient states.  We will accomplish this in two phases. In the first phase, we will test whether modification of behavior alone can generate a pro-resilient state. We will take a novel quantitative approach to behavior analysis, using machine learning to identify specific micro behaviors that are unique to resilient individuals during a chronic social stress. Then, to test whether promoting these behaviors can provide depression-protective effects, we will then use a closed-loop strategy to detect ongoing behavior, and reinforce identified pro-resilient micro behaviors. Second, we will perform circuit-wide calcium recordings in the brain’s subcortical social behavior network and perform unsupervised detection of pro-resilience circuit motifs across the population. We will then use a novel closed-loop read-write strategy to optogentically “tune” the circuit dynamics to mimic these pro-resilient states. We will further explore how these interventions can be accomplished at various time points relative to a stressful life event (before, during, and after) to test whether circuit intervention can potentially provide protective or restorative treatment.  These data can potentially be used to develop novel behavior-based therapies for MDD, or to significantly refine the current use of deep-brain stimulation in order to generate pro-resilient states. Depression and associated anxiety disorders are the most prevalent and costly mental illnesses in the United States, and current drug-based approaches to treatment are expensive, temporally nonspecific, and often ineffective. Here, we propose to explore whether we can prevent and reverse outcomes associated with stress-induced depression through a novel individualized closed-loop intervention strategy. To do this, we will leverage recent advances in machine learning to longitudinally track the behaviors and underlying neural dynamics of “super resilient” individuals who are resistant to stress-induced depression and reinforce these behavior-based patterns in depressed individuals in order to promote pro-resilience states.",Generating pro-resilient states through individualized circuit read-write therapeutics,10002574,DP2MH126375,"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Chronic', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Resistance', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States', 'Writing', 'base', 'cost', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'prevent', 'protective effect', 'reinforced behavior', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'resilient behavior', 'restorative treatment', 'social stress']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP2,2020,2430000,0.015891867196561577
"2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference SUMMARY This proposal requests support for the Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computation and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. Together, these approaches that include different brain models, and levels of analyses and involve an interdisciplinary research community will get us closer to one of the ultimate goals of the field of cognitive neuroscience – to explain human cognition. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and motor cognition, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the role of subcortical structures such as the thalamus in perception and cognition, 2) a discussion on the many ways neural information may be encoded across different levels from local ensembles to large scale circuits, 3) an overview of recent developments to probe neural circuits beyond the traditional microelectrode recording including several brain models (rodents, non-human primates and humans), and 4) an exploration of the relation of our field to computer science and artificial intelligence. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of perception, memory, motor cognition, decision-making and its relation to artificial intelligence. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism and will inform the further development of brain machine interfaces.",2020 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference,10070417,R13NS116969,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fostering', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'To specify', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'computer science', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2020,15000,0.012867143663657083
"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,0.008234345798601352
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,9862969,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,479816,0.04204191486216058
"Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance. Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal- oriented behaviors. The goal of the proposed research is to understand the principles that permit nervous systems to distinguish external from internally-generated sensory stimuli. Here I propose to develop a small circuit model of this process using the antennal mechanosensory system of the fruit fly. The insights gained from a tractable genetic circuit model will enable us to understand how these mechanisms fail in disease, supporting the BRAIN Initiative’s mission to understand the neural circuit basis of a critical brain function.",Mechanisms of Active Sensing in Drosophila,10012952,K99NS114179,"['Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Closure by clamp', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Wind', 'Esthesia', 'Failure', 'Fingers', 'Flying body movement', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Odors', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Study models', 'System', 'Testing', 'Touch sensation', 'Translating', 'Walking', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'goal oriented behavior', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory stimulus', 'tool']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,134007,0.024199318961415577
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,9868821,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69554,0.032807050587981675
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.004234543191684692
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,9994388,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,242813,0.006657149640323989
"Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a neural circuit for flexible control of innate behaviors,9920206,K99MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,K99,2020,110754,0.04630523210290329
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,9962148,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2020,69926,0.021581350320467405
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9949794,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,385524,0.008164269437595595
"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system – based on dopamine – that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these ‘prediction error’ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level ‘task states’ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to ‘decode’ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,9947251,R01DA050647,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Update', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'dopamine system', 'drug of abuse', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,283500,0.04415667925467188
"Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Selective attention is an essential cognitive ability that permits us to effectively process and act upon relevant information while ignoring distracting events. A network involving frontal and parietal cortex for top-down attentional control, referred to as the Dorsal Attention Network (DAN), is active during both spatial and non- spatial (feature-based) attention. However, we know very little about the fine structure of attentional control activity in the DAN, how this structure changes to represent different to-be-attended stimulus features, how the connectivity within the DAN, and between the DAN and sensory cortex shifts when attending different features, or how these top-down processes and their influence in sensory cortex unfold over time. This gap in our knowledge is a critical problem for our models and theories of attention, and because attentional deficits are involved in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia. The working model guiding this research is that top-down attentional control, based on different to-be-attended stimulus attributes, is guided by a smaller-scale neural fine structure within the DAN and prefrontal cortex that makes specific connections with specialized areas of visual cortex coding the attended attributes. Moreover, the time course of activity within the DAN in relation to that in sensory cortex follows a top-down cascading model, being earliest in frontal, then parietal cortex, and finally sensory cortex for preparatory, voluntary, attentional control. To identify the functional networks for attentional control for different forms of attention, and to define their time courses, this project uses innovative simultaneous recording of electroencephalographic (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Advanced signal processing and modeling, including multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), graph theoretic connectivity analysis, and Granger causality analysis will be used to reveal the fine functional anatomy and time course of attentional control and selection. The project includes three experiments that vary the to-be-attended stimulus attributes from spatial location to stimulus features (color and motion), and pursues three aims. Aim 1 is to reveal the fine structure of top-down preparatory attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus features. Aim 2 is to elucidate the specific connectivity between fine structures for preparatory attentional control in the DAN and their target sensory structures in sensory cortex. Aim 3 is to reveal the time course of top-down attentional control for different to-be-attended stimulus attributes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The capacity to focus attention is at the core of human mental functioning, and therefore, elucidating the neural bases of attention remains a central challenge for neuroscience, representing an essential aim in translational efforts to ameliorate attentional deficits in a wide variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, attention deficit disorder, dementia, and schizophrenia.",Mechanisms of attentional control: Structure and dynamics from simultaneous EEG-fMRI and machine learning,9878145,R01MH117991,"['Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Color', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Discrimination', 'Dorsal', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Inferior', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive ability', 'data integration', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mental function', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective attention', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,530307,0.013708700778815856
"CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits Despite substantial progress characterizing neural responses, it is particularly challenging to determine  causal interactions within recurrently connected circuits due to the confounding influence of the  interconnections. This proposed project pioneers a nascent field of closed-loop computational neuroscience that enables real-time feedback stimulation during experiments to decouple recurrently connected elements and make stronger causal inferences about their interactions. Specifically, the  contributions of this project will include: Aim 1) Using modern unsupervised machine learning methods to fit latent state dynamical system models of population responses under closed-loop stimulation. The  developed techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in genetically targeted inhibitory interneurons  across S 1 cortical laminae in the mouse to map the causal effect of inhibitory cells on the sensory gain in  excitatory cells. Aim 2) Merging and extending tools from network feedback control and causal inference  to identify functional connections between network nodes using realistic experimental constraints. These  techniques will be used to clamp firing rate in different S1 laminae of the mouse, using distributed  perturbations to identify the functional connectivity between microcircuit layers during sensory stimulation.  Aim 3) Developing a large-scale computational modeling environment to serve as an in si\ico testbed for the community.  Significance: The proposed project changes the de facto standard use of stimulation in experiments to  leverage the full power of new recording and s.timulation technology for decoupling recurrently connected  variables and making stronger causal inferences.  Broader impacts: While the project uses rodent somatosensation as a model system, the results of this  project will provide new techniques to study neurologic disorders involving disfunction of recurrent circuits  (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and depression). The open-source implementations will constitute  critical algorithmic infrastructure for closed-loop stimulation experiments. This project will also result in the  production of new trainees in an emerging new interdisciplinary field of closed-loop computational neuroscience. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The neural circuits that fail in many neurologic disorders (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and  depression) are difficult to study because they involve complex feedback loops. This project will develop  algorithms that combine measurements and stimulation in real-time to provide powerful new tools to  uncover the operating principles of these circuits and change their operation. Discovery in this area can  help improve understanding of neurologic disorders and development of new stimulation therapies. n/a",CRCNS: Closed-Loop Computational Neuroscience for Causally Dissecting Circuits,9978162,R01NS115327,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Closure by clamp', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Feedback', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neural Pathways', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Opsin', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Production', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventroposterior Medial Nucleus of the Thalamus', 'Vibrissae', 'awake', 'cell type', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'open source', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'real time model', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'technology development', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,324660,0.00905822106845166
"Neurophysiologically-informed Design of Flexible, 2-learner Brain-Machine Interfaces for Robust and Skillful Performance PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to elucidate the computational and neural basis of neuroprosthetic skill learning by leveraging recent advances in the science and engineering of closed-loop brain-machine interfacing. The outcome of the proposed work has the potential to guide the development of the next generation of neurophysiologically-informed, cortically-controlled neuroprosthetic systems for patients with neurological disorders. State-of-the-art brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) leverage machine learning to rapidly calibrate to the neural activity of individuals, but performance also benefits from subjects learning to reliably produce desired neural activity patterns. The basic science and engineering principles of designing such a “2-learner BMI” in which the brain and machine synergistically learn are not well understood. Hence, this proposal aims to investigate how the brain learns when the machine undergoes different degrees of learning, how different degrees of brain learning affect long-term BMI performance, robustness, and generalization, and how these principles can guide the design of a 2-learner BMI system which facilitates brain learning. The proposal is structured in three aims: 1) To study the impact of decoder adaptation on the development of neural encoding models underlying neuroprosthetic skill; 2) To Study how decoder adaptation and resultant neural encoding model influences BMI performance with perturbations (robustness) and BMI performance on unpracticed tasks (generalization); and 3) Design and validation of the next-generation Flexible 2-Learner Decoder architecture. The analyses and experiments proposed in these aims will leverage the fundamental knowledge gained about how the brain learns and acquires neuroprosthetic skills into the neurophysiologically-informed design of robust and high-performance closed-loop motor neuroprosthetics that generalize to new tasks.

"Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Although basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia, the underlying pathophysiology is unknown. The major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum. The vast majority of neurons in the striatum are GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal pallidum (GPi) to promote movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external pallidum (GPe) to inhibit movement. Although dSPNs and dSPNs are largely segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert and within ensembles of coactivity to select and refine movements. In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity appears to be disrupted as microelectrode recordings in dystonia patients reveal abnormal activity in both GPi and GPe. Although these results implicate abnormal activity in both dSPNs and iSPNs, the abnormal patterns of striatal activity that mediate dystonia are unknown. Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the abnormal neural code underlying dystonia. First, the information obtained from microelectrode recording in patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, because dystonia is induced by movement, recordings must be made in awake unrestrained subjects to obtain authentic results. Third, to meaningfully understand striatal pathophysiology, it is necessary to distinguish between dSPNs and iSPNs, which is challenging to accomplish using microelectrode recordings in vivo because these two distinct cells types are intermingled within the striatum. With the recent development of lightweight miniature fluorescence microscopes that can be used to image the activity of genetically-identified SPNs in freely moving mice, we can overcome these obstacles to understand the physiological substrates of dystonia. For the first experiments to reveal abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia, we will use a knockin mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD) in which the striatum is known to play a central role in mediating the dystonia. In fact, both dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted in these mice. Thus, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the neural code of dystonia for the first time. The Specific Aim is to identify abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia. We will test the hypothesis that dystonia is mediated by abnormal neuronal activity and degraded ensemble activity of dSPNs and iSPNs by performing in vivo Ca2+ imaging in freely moving normal or DRD mice that selectively express the GCaMP6f calcium indicator in either dSPNs or iSPNs. Abnormal firing patterns including the degree of spatial clustering of coactive neurons will be assessed using both well-established approaches and a novel analysis of population dynamics using a machine learning algorithm that we recently developed to identify and predict dystonia-specific neuronal ensemble firing patterns. Although dystonia is the third most common movement disorder after tremor and Parkinson’s disease, treatments for dystonia are inadequate because the underlying neuronal dysfunction is not well understood. Understanding abnormal patterns of striatal activity in dystonia will provide a novel platform for the development of therapeutics that target the abnormal neural code, rather than the traditional one-drug-one-target approach.!",Striatal pathophysiology in dystonia,9957592,R21NS116311,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopa-Responsive Dystonia', 'Dopamine', 'Dopamine D1 Receptor', 'Dopamine D2 Receptor', 'Dopamine Receptor', 'Dystonia', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Human', 'Image', 'Involuntary Movements', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Mutation', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tremor', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'awake', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'fluorescence microscope', 'in vivo', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,427605,0.030149781036033312
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory- experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way, I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,9871193,K99NS114194,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'limb movement', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'motor behavior', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'supervised learning', 'theories']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2020,124157,0.048541975380554506
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10122043,R01NS117150,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Calcium ion', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clozapine', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dissection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Oxides', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Seizures', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Virus', 'awake', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'density', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,424537,0.029355809803527016
"Data-driven analysis for neuronal dynamic modeling Project Summary / Abstract Our main goal is to unravel communication dynamics in the brain, as they relate to various sensory-motor actions and to the learning process. The sensory-motor system operates through the concerted interaction of multiple closed-loops feedback systems. While some broad level knowledge is available about single neuron properties and general high-level operations, we lack understanding of functional aspects of neural dynamics, of inter-neuronal interactions and of the modular interaction and integration of brain regions contributing to motor activity. Two photon calcium imaging has revolutionized experimental capabilities to measure large-scale neuronal activity, but poses a significant challenge in terms of massive dynamical data analysis. We intend to confront these challenges face-on, to significantly boost the quality and relevance of experimental data collected during the process of animal learning and execution of motor functions. Our goal is to build an end-to-end modular platform to organize automatically (in a data agnostic way) the dynamical observation space into dynamic scenarios corresponding to contextual groups of neuronal dynamics and to specific motor activity in different related trials. Our plan follows a path from low-level processing of raw calcium imaging data through mid-level organization of extracted neuronal time-traces and finally to high-level inference and prediction of behavior. We aim to extend prior geometric dynamics analysis methods for nonlinear empirical modeling to the complexity of the large-scale neuronal data. Our methodology leads to the determination of low-dimensional intrinsic dynamical sub-processes that provides a coherent explanation of the observed data, and to testable experimental predictions. Unlike conventional neuronal data processing postulating a-priori specific structural models, we rely only on general data-agnostic coherence assumptions. These settings remove bias due to a- priori modeling and enable developing tools that are independent of the acquisition modality, simplifying data fusion (such as neuronal and behavioral observations). Our initial experimental setup is two photon calcium imaging measurements of a head-fixed mouse, performing a motor reach task in multiple repetitive trials. The brain imaging data is synchronized with acquired high- resolution behavioral video. As we show in this proposal, we already have preliminary results demonstrating the power of our empirical analytics methods. Project Narrative In this project, we introduce a methodology for unravelling the complexity of neuronal activity in the brain of a mouse, while performing various tasks. Our main goal is to develop and provide an end-to-end system of modular mathematical tools to automatically analyze, co-organize and model massive amounts of high- resolution spatiotemporal neuronal activity with motor functions.

"Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain Abstract Neural circuits composed of interconnected neurons with distinct properties lay the physical foundation of any brain function. Identifying connections between individual neurons is central to understand how information is processed and propagated in the brain. While emerging high throughput light microscopy technologies are highly promising in allowing whole brain scale imaging at the single cell level, optical resolution limitation prevents their use in differentiating densely labeled neuronal processes in the same brain. In addition, computational tools for automatically extracting morphological information from intermingled neurons with high accuracy are still lacking. Our team will concurrently develop novel genetic tools for neuronal labeling, super-resolution imaging, and automated neuronal tracing for high-throughput circuit reconstruction. We will apply these tools to obtain densely reconstructed inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex. These tools will be readily applicable for studying other long-standing questions in neuroscience and the resources generated by this project will be useful for future computational tool development. Narrative Neuronal morphology is an important attribute for characterizing neural developmental and degenerative diseases. Abnormal dendritic and/or axonal arbors indicate disfunction in neuronal activity and connectivity. Automated reconstruction of neural circuit from a densely labeled brain remains a technical challenge as the intermingled neuronal processes result in many ambiguities when they appear as running into each other in a light microscopy image. We will develop an integrative strategy, which combines advanced labeling, sample preparing, imaging and computing techniques to permit automated microconnectivity analysis in regular neurobiology labs. Our study on inhibitory microcircuits in the mouse cortex will greatly advance the fundamental knowledge about how inhibition is formed. This is highly relevant to the circuitry mechanism of Autism Spectrum Disorder and many other neural disorder diseases, which are caused by an excitation-inhibition imbalance in the brain.","Integrative labeling, imaging, and reconstruction tools for high-throughput inhibitory microconnectivity analysis in the mouse brain",10025817,RF1MH123402,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cre driver', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'anatomic imaging', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'learning network', 'light microscopy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,RF1,2020,2900000,0.001620304934900481

Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10054745,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2020,196326,0.018596254500692636
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9980718,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,356032,0.013162102111123588
"Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain Project Summary/Abstract Bipolar disorder is a chronic and often severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic basis. However, even with significant progress made by molecular genetic studies, the few genetic variants associated with the disorder explain only a small portion of its heritability, which led to the hypothesis of the involvement of epigenetic alterations in BD’s pathophysiology. While recent studies have attempted to identify epigenetic biomarkers in BD, most results are limited due to the tissue specificity of epigenetic alterations and the biased assessments of candidate genes or genome-wide investigations through microarrays. Since the search for biomarkers have repetitively focused on peripheral measures that do not necessarily reflect brain alterations, significant biologically- and clinically-relevant findings have been significantly hindered. This study will fill this important gap by measuring epigenetic markers in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by the brain. Specifically, we will focus on microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs that have been recently proposed to mediate important mechanisms in BD and may integrate gene and environment stimuli. Of note, microRNAs- filled EVs are released by the neural tissue as a method of cell-to-cell communication and may be the key players in transferring epigenetic markers to germ cells, ultimately contributing to the inter- and transgenerational transmission of BD. Our working hypothesis is that patients with BD will show alterations in specific miRNAs and other non-coding RNA transcripts in plasma neural-derived EVs compared to controls. To test this, we will initially identify neural-specific EVs microRNAs in BD by analyzing blood samples from 60 healthy controls and 60 BD type I patients (already collected and stored in our Department) (Aim 1). After neural-derived EVs immunoprecipitation and characterization, RNA will be isolated and next generation sequencing libraries will be prepared and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq instrument with 1x75 bp single-end reads at an approximate depth of 10-15 million reads per sample. Significantly altered miRNAs will be validated by real-time PCR and the putative biological relevance of the differentially expressed transcripts will be assessed by functional pathway analyses. In addition, a machine learning model will be built using the miRNA expression data in order to predict whether an individual sample belongs to the BD or control group, allowing for the establishment of a clinically useful predictive biosignature that can have immediate impact in the field. On a second step we will investigate the correlation between neuronal EVs transcriptome markers with clinical, neuroanatomical, and neurocognitive parameters available for each subject, with the ultimate goal of identifying the clinical relevance of the newly- identified EVs markers in endophenotypes of illness (Aim 2). The identification of such brain-specific markers will likely open new avenues for scientific investigation of BD. Public Health Relevance Statement The proposed research is relevant to public health because bipolar disorder is a chronic and highly disabling condition with a strong familial aggregation, yet non-genetic mechanisms (such as microRNAs) underlying the disorder are still fairly unknown. The investigation of plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles in bipolar disorder patients and controls and the development of a machine learning algorithm for the identification of a microRNA biosignature can lead to the identification of clinically relevant peripherally measured brain-specific biomarkers that can improve our understanding of the disorder and inform the development of personalized treatments.",Neural-derived extracellular vesicles microRNAs in bipolar disorder: a peripheral window into the brain,9973236,R21MH117636,"['Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edetic Acid', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'First Degree Relative', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Multivesicular Body', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'biosignature', 'candidate marker', 'clinically relevant', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'intercellular communication', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'milliliter', 'next generation sequencing', 'non-genetic', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'severe psychiatric disorder', 'specific biomarkers', 'transcriptome', 'transmission process', 'vesicular release', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2020,194584,-0.005385919987852105
"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population. These maps will then be used to identify novel brain-network based targets for the development of new therapeutics, establishing a unique approach that could be applied broadly to many brain disorders for which effective therapies remain elusive.",Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states,10001808,DP2MH126377,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Fibromyalgia', 'General Population', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Testing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'hypersensitivity desensitization', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,DP2,2020,2317500,-0.0069907904457019695
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10033671,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,503268,0.0022633161609918514
"CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning Humans and other animals can choose their actions using multiple learning algorithms and decision­ making strategies. For example, habitual behaviors adapted to a stable environment can be selected using so-called model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, in which the value of each action is incrementally updated according to the amount of unexpected reward. The underlying neural mechanisms for this type of reinforcement learning have been intensively studied. By contrast, how the brain utilizes the animal's knowledge of its environment to plan sequential actions using a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm remains unexplored. In this application, PIs with complementary expertise will investigate how different subdivisions of the primate prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and arbitration of different learning algorithms during strategic planning in primates, using a sequential game referred to as ""4-in-a­ row"". Previous studies have revealed that with training, humans improve their competence in this game by gradually switching away from a model-free reinforcement learning towards a model-based reinforcement learning in the form of a tree search. In the first set of experiments, we will train non-human primates to play the 4-in-a-row game against a computer opponent. We predict that the complexity of the strategic planning and the opponent's move violating the animal's expectation will be reflected in the speed of animal's action and pupil diameters. Next, we will test how the medial and lateral aspects of prefrontal cortex contribute to the evaluation and selection of different learning algorithms during strategic interaction between the animal and computer opponent. We hypothesize that the lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in computing the integrated values of alternative actions originating from multiple sources and guiding the animal's choice, whereas the medial prefrontal cortex might be more involved in monitoring and resolving the discrepancies of actions favored by different learning algorithms. The results from these experiments will expand our knowledge of the neural mechanisms for complex strategic planning and unify various approaches to study naturalistic behaviors. By taking advantage of recent advances in machine learning and decision neuroscience, proposed studies will elucidate how multiple learning algorithms are simultaneously implemented and coordinated via specific patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex. The results from these studies will transform the behavioral and analytical paradigms used to study high-order planning and their neural underpinnings in humans and animals. Strategic planning is commonly impaired in many psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia and depression, but their underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The proposed studies will elucidate the role of prefrontal cortex in implementing and arbitrating between multiple learning algorithms used for strategic planning.",CRCNS:  Neural Basis of Planning,9929660,R01MH118925,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Structures', 'Animals', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Probability', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Update', 'base', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'fictional works', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'source guides']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,387421,0.030492485205348585
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,0.05079937024877177
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level.

"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10004169,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,713309,-0.0020403785493970073
"A novel geometric paradigm for nonlinear modeling and control of neural dynamics PROJECT SUMMARY A standing challenge in neuroscience is to control the activity of large populations of interconnected neurons that underlie our brain’s functions and dysfunctions. The dynamics of these neural activity patterns are immensely complex and nonlinear, making their modeling extremely difficult. Thus, the precise control of neural dynamics and the associated mental states using stimulation input has remained elusive to date. If precise dynamic modeling and control was possible, this would both elucidate the neural basis of behavior and treat the most prevalent and disabling mental disorders such as depression or addiction, which are a leading cause of disability worldwide. The goal of this innovative proposal is to move toward making this vision a reality. We will: (1) develop a novel biologically-informed geometric paradigm to achieve nonlinear dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of neural population activity; (2) demonstrate it on brain network activity collected from the monkey motor system and the human corticolimbic system to characterize the neural dynamics of complex movements and control the neural biomarkers of depressed mood, respectively. This geometric paradigm will be based on a central idea: if we learn and model the low-dimensional nonlinear geometric space over which neural population activity evolves in time, we can then analytically write the dynamic model in a much simpler form over this manifold; this will allow for precise modeling of nonlinear dynamics and enable their control, which is otherwise impractical. Capturing the nonlinearity in the geometry to achieve control of brain dynamics with unprecedented precision is a major innovation and departure from current methods. We introduce concepts from algebraic topology and differential geometry into neural dynamic modeling and control. We will develop new methods at the interface of these disciplines, neuroscience, machine learning and control theory to: (1) identify the type of manifold that embeds neural dynamics (e.g., torus or sphere); (2) develop novel algorithms that learn analytical dynamic models over this manifold (both with and without stimulation input); (3) build decoders and controllers of neural dynamics that incorporate the biologically-informed nonlinear geometric models. We will provide three rigorous experimental demonstrations on rich data from two distinct neural systems: (i) existing spike-field activity from monkey motor cortices during complex reach-and-grasps; (ii) existing multisite intracranial human brain activity in the corticolimbic system with simultaneous mood tracking; (iii) new closed-loop control experiments to selectively modulate brain network activity underlying mood states in the corticolimbic system using electrical stimulation. The paradigm will provide a new tool to build interpretable, low-dimensional, and controllable nonlinear models of neural dynamics to elucidate the neural basis of behavior and disease. Also, it will achieve nonlinear closed- loop control of neural dynamics underlying mental states and lead to closed-loop brain stimulation systems that could transform treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression or addiction for millions of patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed geometric paradigm for dynamic modeling and closed-loop control of nonlinear brain dynamics will provide a new scientific tool to study neural mechanisms in health and disease, and innovative closed-loop controllers of mental states with unprecedented precision to facilitate precisely-tailored stimulation treatments for a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

"Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex. Project Summary How is the representation of complex visual objects organized in inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the large brain region responsible for object recognition? To date, areas selective for a few categories such as faces, bodies, and scenes have been found, but the vast majority of IT cortex is “wild,” lacking any known specialization. Various schemes have been proposed for parceling IT, but a comprehensive understanding of IT organization remains elusive. Here, we propose to use fMRI, microstimulation, and electrophysiology to develop a unified understanding of the organization and coding principles of macaque IT. The experiments are motivated by a major advance in computer vision and two key preliminary results from our lab. First, the advent of deep networks trained for object classification makes it possible to generate a parametric object space, providing a quantitative framework to decipher the feature selectivity of single IT cells. Second, our preliminary results suggest that a large portion of macaque IT cortex is topographically organized according to the first two principal components of object space. This topography encompasses at least four distinct networks, each with at least three hierarchical nodes of increasing view invariance, and includes the previously described face and body patch networks. Furthermore, single cells within each network are projecting incoming objects, formatted as vectors in the object space, onto specific preferred axes. Taken together, these results suggest a new hypothesis for IT organization: IT cortex is tiled by networks (i.e., sets of functionally connected nodes, where a node is a patch of IT cells) whose organization and coding principles are very similar to that of the face patch network, and the layout of these networks follows a regular topography specified by the statistical structure of object space. We propose three Specific Aims to rigorously test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will systematically map all networks within IT of individual animals. In Aim 2, we will record responses of cells in each identified network to a large, common set of object stimuli and determine their coding scheme. In Aim 3, we will perturb activity in each network and quantitatively assess effect on object recognition behavior. Together, these three Aims seek to build a comprehensive understanding of IT organization that bridges fMRI, single units, and behavior. Our lab has developed powerful experimental techniques to tackle each of these Aims and has previously applied them to the macaque face patch system. We believe the time is ripe to apply these techniques to the larger problem of how all objects are represented--not just faces. In the same way that Mendeleev’s arrangement of chemical elements according to their atomic mass and chemical properties helped elucidate the electronic structure of atoms, we believe systematic mapping and characterization of all networks in IT will help elucidate the fundamental neural mechanism for object recognition. Narrative This basic research application will investigate how visual objects are processed by the brain. The brain areas we will study are located in the temporal lobe, a brain region especially susceptible to neurological disease including Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. The planned studies will provide valuable insight into the fundamental code cells in this region use to represent visual information, and will thereby contribute to better understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases targeting this part of the brain.",Discovering the rules for the organization of macaque inferotemporal cortex.,10006884,R01EY030650,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glean', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Macaca', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Monkeys', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'chemical property', 'electronic structure', 'experimental study', 'inferotemporal cortex', 'insight', 'microstimulation', 'movie', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'object perception', 'object recognition', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'vector', 'visual information']",NEI,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,575750,-0.00424735735253523
"Cracking the Olfactory Code Project Summary (Overall: Cracking the Olfactory Code)  Sensation drives perception, which informs decisions and actions. Olfaction is the main sense used by most animals to interact with the environment. However, olfaction remains shrouded in mystery — we do not know which molecular odorant features matter to the olfactory system and which do not, how information about these features is recombined to create holistic odor representations within the brain, or how those representations relate to perception. As a consequence, we lack an empirical understanding of the core transformations taking place at each stage of olfactory processing, which ultimately lead to perception and behavior. In addition, we lack a clear theoretical framework for understanding how a stimulus space that is both discrete and high-dimensional yields a perceptual space that is continuous and low dimensional. Because the olfactory system is “shallow” — meaning that within two synapses information about complete odor objects is abstracted and generalized — understanding this specific circuit will also afford general insight both into architecturally-related allocortical brain regions critical to behavior (e.g., cerebellum, hippocampus), and into cortical centers that play a key role in integrating diverse sources of information (e.g., prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex). Here we propose to reveal the computational logic of olfaction by collecting the first system-wide dataset of neural and perceptual responses to a large, principled set of odorants, and by applying a unified statistical and theoretical approach to its interpretation. This project will convene research groups with expertise that spans neurobiology, and will leverage recent technical advances in molecular genetics, neural imaging, electrophysiology, opto- and chemogenetics, human psychophysics, and machine learning to interrogate all levels (from peripheral receptors to cortex to perceptual and behavioral output) of the olfactory system. Taken together, these experiments will establish a reference dataset that reveals the key transformations performed by the olfactory system, test a key unifying theory for olfaction, and create a community-wide resource that will prompt new theory and experiment. This work will also have wide-ranging implications for our general understanding of how sensory information is organized in the brain to facilitate adaptive action. Project Narrative (Overall) The brain builds rich internal representations of the external world in order to support perception and behavior. Here we take advantage of the architectural simplicity of the mammalian olfactory system — and an interdisciplinary team whose expertise ranges from molecular genetics and optogenetic to machine learning and human psychophysics — to characterize how odor information is sequentially transformed by neural circuits to generate meaningful perception. This work will both address longstanding mysteries about the inner workings of the olfactory system, and reveal general principles that govern how the brain organizes and processes information.",Cracking the Olfactory Code,10001592,U19NS112953,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Frequencies', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sense Organs', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'data integration', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging approach', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'insight', 'meetings', 'neural circuit', 'new technology', 'novel', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory receptor', 'olfactory stimulus', 'optogenetics', 'piriform cortex', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'stimulus processing', 'theories', 'working group']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U19,2020,2773998,0.019273897629730984
"CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System There is a fundamental gap in our understanding of the computational principles and neural mechanisms by which neural circuits represent complex objects like faces. This conceptual gap constitutes an important problem because, until it is filled, we will not be able to understand face recognition and the reasons for face blindness. The long-term goal is to understand the computational principles and neural mechanisms of face recognition and create a computer face-recognition system based on these principles. The overall objective of this proposal is the determination of the computational principles of local and global face feature coding in the brain's face-processing network. The central hypothesis is that high-level feature tuning in face-selective areas can be understood as the result of the statistical properties of stimulus space and general organizational features of the circuits that process these stimuli. The rationale for this proposal is that completion of the proposed research will provide an understanding, of how neural circuits generate a meaningful representation of complex visual shape, imposing critical constraints on theories of vision. The hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims, which will determine 1) neural mechanism for facial feature tuning, 2) neural mechanism for categorical face selectivity, and 3) neural mechanisms for transformations of feature tuning. The joint computational and experimental approach will integrate functional magnetic resonance imaging to localize face areas with electrophysiological recordings targeted to these regions and computational analyses of model systems. The approach is innovative through the tight coupling of theoretical principles and experimental validation and by developing novel theoretical and experimental methodologies. The proposed research is significant, because it will unravel principles of neural circuit function that are of general relevance for understanding visual object recognition and multi-node networks. Because the outcome is an advance in understanding circuit mechanisms of social perception, it will identify vulnerabilities of the face-processing system directly relevant to the understanding of face blindness, prosopagnosia, and of altered social perception in syndromes spanning autism spectrum disorders, fragile X, and Williams syndrome. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the neural mechanisms of face processing are essential to human social life, and altered social perception is characteristic of many pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Studies proposed in this application will identify the computational principles of face recognition circuitry and suggest how alterations to these circuits impair function. Thus the proposed research is relevant to NIH's mission to reduce illness and disability.",CRCNS: US-Japan Research Proposal: The Computational Principles of a Neural Face Processing System,10016303,R01EY029998,"['Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computers', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intelligence', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Macaca', 'Masks', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Primates', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosopagnosia', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Shapes', 'Social Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Perception', 'Williams Syndrome', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive process', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'developmental prosopagnosia', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotechnology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'object recognition', 'operation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory system', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'success', 'theories']",NEI,ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,265973,0.03977994814061599
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",9904776,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2020,538317,0.01238550612819919
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9970165,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2020,37032,-0.003869189987060384
"Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation Project Abstract/Summary This application describes a 3-year training plan that will enable me, a cognitive neuroscientist with prior training in electroencephalography (EEG), to conduct research on contextual memory representation using neuroimaging (fMRI) and computational modeling. EEG is useful for examining the timing properties of neural activity, but cannot localize activity to specific regions of the brain. In this proposal, I will receive training on a high-spatial resolution neuroimaging technique (fMRI), which will allow me to develop theories of neural function that are constrained by both space and time. I will also build on my prior degree in applied statistics and receive additional training in computational neuroscience, which will enable me to develop computational theories at the macro-circuit level. I will be supervised by Dr. Sharon Thompson-Schill, an expert fMRI experimentalist and theorist of lateral prefrontal cortex function, who has extensive experience researching the context-dependent nature of semantic memory. I will be co-supervised by Dr. Anna Schapiro, an expert on statistical learning and computational modeling of the brain. I propose to examine how prefrontal cortex (PFC) represents statistical dependencies among sequentially presented visual and auditory input. I will examine how the temporal extent and level of abstraction of sequential representations changes across ventral PFC. This will connect findings from several literatures, ranging from decision-making to emotion processing and language comprehension, within a single unifying framework. In addition, I will explore whether ‘deep’ or ‘shallow’ recurrent neural networks better capture the sensitivity profile of ventral PFC, informing the question of whether the brain conducts ‘deep’ learning. In Aim 1, I will conduct behavioral piloting and collect data for two neuroimaging experiments on hierarchical sequential processing. I will have participants learn the statistical properties of hierarchically organized sequences of abstract visual (Aim 1a&b) and auditory (Aim 1b) images. I then test for neural sensitivity to statistical learning at each hierarchical level using pattern similarity analysis, comparing the neural response to the sequences before and after learning. In Aim 2, I will conduct computational modeling of the neuroimaging data in Aim 1, with held out data to ensure robustness and reproducibility. I compare the neuroimaging data to internal model representations derived from single-layer (‘shallow’) and multi-layer (‘deep’) recurrent neural networks trained on the same sequences as the humans in Aim 1. By modeling the neural representation of context itself, the current proposal will help fill a critical gap in our understanding of how the brain predicts upcoming sensory input, enabling rapid processing of the world around us. It will also inform our understanding of several psychiatric disorders that involve prefrontal cortex disfunction and disturbances of contextual processing, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. Project Narrative As we navigate the world we are bombarded by a flood of sensations that our brain must rapidly make sense of, and understanding the context we are in as it relates to the likelihood of upcoming experiences is important for enhancing the speed and accuracy of this process. This proposal examines how sensory context is represented in the brain, by having people learn statistical regularities in artificial sequences of images and syllables and modeling neural activity in prefrontal cortex as they are exposed to different sensory “contexts” using fMRI. Through computational modeling of prefrontal cortex, we can enhance our understanding of the function of a brain region implicated in many neuropsychological disorders where the perception of context is distorted or disrupted, including anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia.",Prefrontal contributions to contextual representation,9990118,F32MH123002,"['Anxiety', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Fractals', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'interest', 'language comprehension', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sequence learning', 'social', 'sound', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2020,64926,0.029839476511077587
"Model-based credit assignment Abstract How the brain forms, tunes, and uses predictive models that specify the causal links between stimuli in the environment, our choices, and their outcomes is a fundamental question in Psychology and Neuroscience. A great deal of progress has been made identifying the neural computations theorized to form and update predictive models. This research has played a central role in the rise of computational psychiatry, but its relevance to clinical disorders has been limited in part by the use of relatively simple learning/choice paradigms that capture only a narrow subset of the structural complexity of real-world learning.  In order to make sound predictions in a complex world, the brain needs to attribute good and bad outcomes to their most likely causes, a problem known as “credit assignment”. There is little understanding of how outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in structured real-world environments. Most real-world learning occurs in complex and structured environments, such as hierarchical systems (e.g. seasonal events, social hierarchies, contextual rules, etc.). Recent evidence suggests that humans can use an understanding of the environment’s causal structure to attribute outcomes to their most likely causes (which I call “model-based credit assignment)”, rather than simply attributing them to the most recently experienced stimuli and choices that were made (which I call “model-free” credit assignment), as standard models have proposed.  The purpose of the present proposal is to develop the first neural model of model-based credit assignment. We hypothesize that the brain reinstates the cause when a reinforcement outcome is experienced to associate with the outcome. In other words, so that “fire-together/wire-together” plasticity mechanisms can link a choice with an outcome, the choice representation and the outcome representation must both be active at the same time even though the causal choice or event may have actually occurred some time beforehand.  To test this and other predictions, we will integrate mathematical descriptions of learning and decision making with “representational” analysis methods that allow inferences to be made about the information represented in brain areas, applied to fMRI and scalp EEG data. fMRI will reveal how neural learning signals update neural representations of likely causes during learning, while EEG will reveal the timing of the hypothesized reinstatement. These experiments will set the stage to apply the insights gained to investigate how the brain attributes outcomes to more abstract “latent” causes in hierarchically structured environments prevalent in the real world. The proposed project will thus move this general program of research strategy toward learning tasks that better reflect the complexity and structure in many real-world learning/choice situations important for both typical and atypical individuals. Project Narrative Research into how the brain forms and tunes predictive models that specify the causal relationships between stimuli in the environment, our actions, and their outcomes has made dramatic strides by identifying key learning computations in the brain in both typical and atypical individuals. However, the application of this research to clinical disorders has been limited by use of relatively simple learning/choice tasks that do not capture much of the structural complexity of real-world learning. The present project aims to develop the first neural model specifying how reinforcement outcomes are attributed to their most likely causes in such structured environments.",Model-based credit assignment,10064687,R56MH119116,"['Address', 'Allergic Reaction', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clams', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Restaurants', 'Role', 'Scallop', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Service delivery model', 'Shellfish', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'shellfish hypersensitivity', 'sound', 'two-dimensional']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,385349,0.004674679785092806
"Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Unrelenting pathological fatigue is a common symptom across a wide range of diseases and is the prominent feature of Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS). Despite its near ubiquitous reporting, little is known about the neurobiology of fatigue. ME/CFS diagnoses presents a definitive medical challenge. Misdiagnoses are common due to lack of biomarkers, reliance on a subjective phemonological criteria and symptom overlap with depression. Individuals with ME/CFS also present with complaints of executive dysfunction. Although cross sectional fMRI studies have reported unique changes in resting state and task evoked brain activity, findings are not specific and show overlap with depression. A striking clinical feature of ME/CFS is the response to exercise, known as post-exertional malaise (PEM). PEM is recognized as the incremental increase in fatigue severity and executive dysfunction following acute exercise. In contrast, patients with depression report a decrease in symptom burden. Despite this known divergent response, studies trying to illuminate predictive biomarkers or the causative association between exercise and changes in functional brain activity have not been adequately attempted. To address this gap, we developed and subsequently tested the utility of a novel and longitudinal 3-day fMRI-exercise paradigm on Gulf War Illness (GWI); a disorder with tremendous overlap of symptoms. Published findings and preliminary evidence from our GWI studies suggest our paradigm may be effective in revealing the neurobiology of fatigue in ME/CFS. This proposal aims to harness the unique combination of fMRI and exercise to elucidate neural correlates of fatigue in ME/CFS. The proposal has three aims. The first aim is to characterize exercise associated decrements in fatigue by modeling changes in functional connectivity within the Default Mode Network. The second aim is designed to demonstrate the consequence of exercise on the causal interactions between higher level cognitive neural systems by effective connectivity analysis. The third aim will leverage machine learning algorithms to predict ME/CFS status from baseline task-free resting state fMRI. Findings would provide strong evidence of pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain the chronicity of fatigue in ME/CFS. Furthermore, the importance of an accurate and detailed description of the neurobiological constructs of fatigue will be a critical step in developing reliable diagnostic tests and potential therapeutic targets. Outcomes from this proposal would suggest an alternative paradigm for studying the neurobiology of fatigue in a broad number of pathological states and potential detection of this almost universal symptom complaint in a clinical setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is an illness characterized by unrelenting fatigue with no consensus mechanism or diagnostic tests. Approximately, 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS leading to a staggering economic impact of $24 billion. This study utilizes an alternative method to study fatigue by combining exercise and neuroimaging to investigate the cardinal complaint of post-exertional malaise (PEM). Outcomes will not only provide objective evidence of ME/CFS pathophysiology but provide a novel paradigm to test the understudied symptom of unrelenting fatigue in a broad number of disease states.",Investigating the neural correlates of fatigue in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(ME/CFS),9963415,F30NS103563,"['Acute', 'Address', 'American', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Career Choice', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exercise', 'Exertion', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gulf War', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Malaise', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'economic impact', 'executive function', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'stressor', 'student training', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapeutic target']",NINDS,HOWARD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,-0.001679957562053428
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,9897551,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,403711,-0.004301843234872809
"Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior Project Summary / Abstract High-throughput experimental neuroscience has made it possible to observe behavior of many animals, as well as a large groups of neurons simultaneously, providing an exciting opportunity for figuring out how the neural system performs computations that underlie perception, cognition, and behavior. However, there is a major bottleneck in the scientific cycle of data analysis and data collection due to the complexity and scale of noisy, high-dimensional data. The primary objective of this project is to develop tools for tracking the internal state of the brain that are not directly measurable from both the behavior and neural signals, and to generate optimal stimulus corresponding to the current brain state. These external stimuli can be used to perturb the animal’s belief or strategy about the world such that the animal would behave differently. Aim 1: Our team will develop a neural state tracking system that will parse out and display complex neural signals recorded from the animal brain in real-time. The neural state tracking algorithm will also extract the law that the neural system operates under, allowing neuroscientist to generate a new class of hypotheses about the population level implementation underlying intelligent behavior. Aim 2: To causally test hypothesis on how population of neurons compute and produce meaningful behavior, it is necessary to be able to perturb the internal computation process. We will develop a feedback control system to perturb the neural dynamics at a short time scale with a novel control scheme for neural computation that respects the brain’s own degrees of freedom. Aim 3: By understanding and tracking the time evolution of internal strategy throughout learning, we can learn how to optimize the training of animal behavior. In this aim, we will develop statistical models of learning and a computational system to generate the best stimuli based on the past performance of the animal. The statistical tools developed in this project will likely accelerate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience. Clinically, this research can extend to monitoring, diagnosing, and building next- generation real-time feedback stimulation devices for disorders with a neurodynamic or behavioral component such as Parkinson’s disease, autism, learning disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, and epilepsy. We will develop new tools to train animals faster for further experiments, and to understand inner  workings of animal brains. These tools will visualize how the internal states change over time as  it happens while the animal is engaged in simple behavior.",Real-time statistical algorithms for controlling neural dynamics and behavior,10001503,R01EB026946,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Closure by clamp', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lateral', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operating System', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rattus', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Scheme', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'design', 'dynamic system', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'neglect', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,7509,0.04176393525498089
"Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia Spasmodic dysphonia (SD) is isolated focal laryngeal dystonia characterized by selective impairment of voluntary voice control during speech production. Despite well-characterized clinical features of SD, its causes and pathophysiology remain unclear. Consequently, the absence of objective biomarkers of SD leads to diagnostic inaccuracies, while the lack of understanding of neural and molecular targets of SD pathophysiology hinders the development of novel therapeutic opportunities for SD patients. Our long-term goal is to determine the causes and pathophysiology of SD and to develop new diagnostic and treatment options for this disorder. The objective of this application is to identify imaging and genetic biomarkers of SD development and manifestation. Our central hypothesis is that functional and structural brain abnormalities, shaped, in part, by underlying causative genetic factors, exhibit disorder-characteristic features, which can be used as diagnostic and predictive SD biomarkers. Our central hypothesis has been formulated on the bases of our preliminary data. The rationale for the proposed studies is that identification of SD neural and genetic biomarkers would have direct clinical impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis, screening of potential persons at-risk, and evaluation of mechanism-based novel pharmacological and/or surgical therapies for these patients. Using a comprehensive approach of multi-modal neuroimaging, machine learning algorithms, and next-generation DNA sequencing, our central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify and validate SD phenotype- and genotype-specific neural markers; (2) Establish endophenotypic markers of SD development; and (3) Identify SD gene(s) and their association with neural markers of SD susceptibility. This research is innovative, because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach as a tool for discovery of the mediating neural mechanisms that bridge the gap between the DNA sequence and SD pathophysiology. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to vertically advance and expand the understanding of the mechanistic aspects of brain alterations, identify neural markers and discover SD gene mutations. Ultimately, the results of these studies are expected to establish new knowledge, which will be critical for enhancement of SD clinical management and identification of novel approaches to new treatment options in these patients. The proposed research aims to identify the neural markers and causative genetic factors of spasmodic dysphonia (SD), which is a form of isolated focal dystonia characterized by involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles during speech production. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the elucidation of the mechanistic aspects of abnormal brain organization and underlying genetic factors is ultimately expected to have a positive translational impact on establishing the enhanced criteria for improved clinical management of SD, including its detection, accurate diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help reduce the burden of human disability.",Imaging genetics of spasmodic dysphonia,9878098,R01DC011805,"['Affect', 'Biological Markers', 'Botulinum Toxins', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dystonia', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family history of', 'Focal Dystonias', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Injections', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Occupational', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Social isolation', 'Spasm', 'Spastic Dysphonias', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Voice', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'disability', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'side effect', 'standard care', 'symptom management', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'trait', 'translational impact']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY,R01,2020,696730,-0.008648073971163447
"Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness SUMMARY The standard view of how we make sense of the world around us focuses on reconstructing our environment from the information received by our sensory organs. In this view, low-level brain areas (e.g., primary sensory cortex) represent basic features of objects, which are elaborated on in successive processing stages, until representations become increasingly complex in high-level areas (e.g., frontal cortex). An alternative view is predictive coding (PC), in which we model our environment to generate sensory predictions. In PC, high-level brain areas generate predictions of sensory activity and transmit them to low-level areas. A prediction that does not match the sensory information gives rise to a prediction error. This error signal is sent from low- to high-level brain areas to update the model of our environment, thereby improving future predictions to minimize errors. Modeling studies show PC is a fast and efficient way to process sensory information, and PC provides innovative hypotheses for understanding sleep and anesthesia, particularly when disconnected consciousness occurs (consciousness without awareness of the environment), like dreaming. PC also holds great promise for conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including schizophrenia and depression. But key central features of PC have not been empirically tested and little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. The goal of the proposed project is to characterize the neural dynamics, circuits and receptors enabling PC. There are two principle hypotheses. First, predictions depend on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) because NMDAR influence the activity of high-level brain areas where predictions are generated, and NMDAR are enriched on neurons in lower-level areas receiving predictions. Second, in disconnected consciousness, a breakdown of information transmission from low-level to high-level brain areas, as well as a breakdown of computations within each area, explains why models of our environment are not updated by external sensory information. These breakdowns prevent the comparison of predictions and sensory information, as well as the transmission of prediction errors to high-level brain areas. To test these hypotheses, we use a cross-species experimental design connecting cellular, circuit and systems levels to behavior. We will perform electroencephalography, machine learning and computational modeling to define the neural basis of PC in humans performing prediction tasks. Then we will manipulate PC using different anesthetic agents with diverse mechanisms, establishing causal relationships between receptors, large-scale brain networks and PC. In parallel, we will simultaneously record activity from sensory and high-level brain areas of non-human primates (NHPs) using the same PC tasks and pharmacological interventions to measure cellular and circuit level contributions to PC. Investigating PC will illuminate the fundamental mechanisms of perception, providing critical insights to guide therapeutic development for multiple health conditions. NARRATIVE This research advances our understanding of how the brain generates predictions which shape how we perceive the world, otherwise known as predictive coding. Predictive coding is relevant to public health because it holds great promise in conceptualizing and treating brain disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, delirium and dementia, as well as understanding sleep and anesthesia. Progress in understanding the basic mechanisms of predictive coding, as well as predictive coding deficits, is a necessary step in developing more effective treatment strategies for multiple health conditions.","Receptors, microcircuits and hierarchical connectivity in predictive coding and sensory awareness",10034682,R01NS117901,"['Adrenergic Receptor', 'Agonist', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthetics', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Conscious', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dementia', 'Dexmedetomidine', 'Disinhibition', 'Dose', 'Dreams', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Pharmacology', 'Process', 'Propofol', 'Public Health', 'Pulvinar structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Study models', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'human data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'paired stimuli', 'postsynaptic', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sedative', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory stimulus', 'therapeutic development', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'visual stimulus']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,517182,0.018752729793619662
"Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools Astrocyte is the most abundant glia cell and significantly outnumbers neuron in the human brain. Long thought to be primarily passive cell, astrocyte has been increasingly recognized as essential player with active regulatory role in neural circuitry and pathology. Since a single astrocyte interacts with thousands of synapses, other glial cells and blood vessels, it is well positioned to link neuronal information in different spatial-temporal dimensions to achieve higher level brain integration. Indeed, neuron-astrocyte communication at synapses regulates breathing, memory formation, motor function, and sleep, and are implicated in many neuropsychiatric disorders. All these results provide strong rationale for modeling and analyzing astrocyte function, which will provide unprecedented insights to our understanding how astrocytes function to regulate and protect brain and how these functions can be exploited for astrocyte-based therapeutic targets. Recent advances in the modern microscopy and ultrasensitive genetic encoded calcium indicators (GECI) have enabled optical recording of astrocytic calcium dynamics – the excitatory state and functional readout of astrocytes – in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Compared to the great experimental capability of generating tremendous volumes of astrocyte functional data, the development of computational tools to analyze and interpret the complex and big data is lagged far behind, which has severely jeopardized a deeper understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes. To address the pressing need, we thus propose to develop sophisticated computational tools for interpreting the complex calcium dynamics data, through judicious application of advanced machine learning and systems theories. We have the following three specific aim. Aim1). Developing computational tools to analyze the cellular properties of calcium signaling in a single astrocyte. Aim2). Developing computational tools to analyze the network properties of calcium signaling in a population of astrocytes. Aim3). Validating experimentally the computational tools, developing optimal experiment protocol and disseminating the software packages. Our preliminary studies on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our plans and highlight the potential of analyzing astrocyte functional activity to understand neuronal circuitry and pathology, including for the first time the surprising discovery of hyper-activity in Down’s syndrome astrocytes compared to the normal astrocytes. This proposal is built on pre-established collaboration between two groups with the much needed complementary expertise for accomplishing this project, (1) computational scientists (Yu lab at Virginia Tech) and (2) experimental neuroscientists (Tian lab at UC Davis). The pre-established working relationships, developed channels of communication and mechanisms for resource sharing will help insure that the work will proceed in an efficient and effective manner. Project Narrative Although astrocytes, the most abundant glia cells in the brain, have been proposed to play important roles in the neural circuitry, our understanding of the physiological roles of astrocyte in neural circuitry is very limited partially due to the lack of sophisticated computational tools to analyze the complex astrocyte calcium data. We thus propose to apply advanced machine learning and systems theories to address the pressing need. Deep understanding of the functional roles of astrocytes in health and disease will translate into identifying novel therapeutic avenues for treatment of brain disorders.",Decoding Astrocyte Signaling in Neural Circuitry with Novel Computational Modeling and Analytical Tools,9852566,R01MH110504,"['Address', 'Astrocytes', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Down Syndrome', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'In Vitro', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Peer Review', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'complex data ', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimmunology', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'synaptogenesis', 'theories', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2020,510889,0.013617355792711719
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9889999,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,680053,-0.0017817725694779403
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10067892,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,45520,0.04549377027530416
"Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Adult patients with epilepsy have an increased prevalence of major depression and other psychiatric co- morbidities. Depression in epilepsy is associated with worse outcome and quality of life. However, it continues to be underdiagnosed and untreated and further attention to this comorbidity is critical. My career goal is to become an academic neuroscientist and clinician focused on understanding the neural networks underlying co- morbid mood and anxiety spectrum disorders in patients with epilepsy.  Specific brain circuits may underlie depression and be commonly affected by different precipitants (i.e. stress, inflammation, epilepsy). In this proposal, our model is that a set of neural features across these brain circuits will be shared across many patients with co-morbid depression. Evidence for a strong relationship between epilepsy and depression includes the presence of depression symptoms before, during, after, and in between seizures, evidence of cases of concurrent onset of depression and epilepsy, an increased incidence of interictal depression when limbic structures are involved in seizure occurrence, and evidence that depression scores may be lower after surgical resection for medication refractory epilepsy. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) captured during the pre-surgical recording period offers a particularly promising method to study depression networks in adult epilepsy, offering both high temporal resolution and spatial precision. Despite the enormous potential of iEEG, there are no studies to date that examine the neurophysiological signatures of network dysfunction in mood and anxiety disorders in patients with epilepsy. Such studies are critical in order to better understand the etiology of co-morbid depression and could lead to novel personalized therapies.  In our pilot work, we identify a set of power spectral measures within a corticolimbic circuit that appear to be linked to depression and are, therefore, a potential biomarker of co-morbid depression. We also found evidence that supports the basis for testing whether neural features will predict treatment outcome. This proposal builds on these preliminary findings to validate our model and test the hypothesis that a set of neural features is shared across some subjects with MDD in epilepsy and is detectable with machine-learning techniques applied to interictal iEEG recordings. Aim 1 demonstrates the relationship between resting state neural circuit abnormality and depression. Aim 2 tests whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether the presurgical resting state iEEG predicts that improvement.  To address these research goals, I will need more rigorous training in computational neuroscience for complex datasets, advanced signal processing, and biostatistics. My training plan and carefully selected mentoring and advisory team across fields of psychiatry, neurosurgery, neurology and statistics will allow me to obtain the necessary experiences to become a fully independent investigator who brings the tools of computational approaches to the service of mental health research and novel personalized treatment paradigms in epilepsy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric co-morbidities in epilepsy are common, undertreated, and poorly understood. Using intracranial recordings in patients who will undergo epilepsy surgery for medication-refractory disease, we propose to test a model that a set of neural features is shared across subjects with depression in epilepsy. We will use computational modeling to identify biomarkers of co-morbid depression, and assess whether removing the dysfunctional region of the circuit improves depression and whether presurgical neural features predict that improvement.",Distributed networks underlying depression in epilepsy: a computational circuit-based approach to biomarker development,10016854,K23NS110962,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Atrophic', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Belief', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Excision', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatry', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory Disease', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'anxiety spectrum disorders', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'career', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'network dysfunction', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurophysiology', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'suicide rate', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,200178,0.022858843656465618
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,9973904,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,645926,-0.05314519497062182
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10005106,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248038,-0.006478957406620932
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,-0.0011198843449811678
"Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex Project Summary People are remarkably adept at making sense of the world through sound: understanding speech in a noisy restaurant, picking out the voice of a family member, or recognizing a familiar melody. Although we take these abilities for granted, they reflect impressive computational feats of biological engineering that are remarkably difficult to replicate in machine systems. The long-term goal of my research program is to develop computational and experimental methods to reverse-engineer how the brain codes natural sounds like speech and to exploit these advances to understand and aid in the treatment of hearing impairment. One of the central challenges of coding natural sounds is that they are structured at many different timescales from milliseconds to seconds and even minutes. How does the brain integrate across these diverse timescales to derive meaning from sound? Answering this question has been challenging because there are no general-purpose methods for measuring neural timescales in the brain. As a consequence, we know relatively little about how neural timescales are organized in auditory cortex and how this organization enables the coding of natural sounds. To overcome these limitations, we develop a simple experimental paradigm (the “temporal context invariance” or TCI paradigm) for estimating the temporal integration period of any sensory response: the time window during which stimuli alter the response. We apply the TCI method to human electrocorticography (ECoG) and animal physiology recordings to reveal the organization of neural timescales at both the region and single-cell level (Aim I). Pilot data from our analyses reveal that timescales are organized hierarchically, with higher-order regions showing substantially longer integration periods. To explore the functional significance of this timescale hierarchy, we couple TCI with computational techniques well-suited for characterizing natural sounds (Aim II). We test whether increased integration periods enable a more noise-robust representation of speech (Aim IIA), whether regions with longer integration periods code higher-order properties of natural sounds (Aim IIB&IIC), whether there are dedicated integration periods for important sounds categories like speech or music (Aim IID), and whether cortical integration periods can be explained by the duration of the features they respond to (Aim IIE). In the process of conducting this research, I will be trained in two critical areas: (1) ECoG, which is the only method with the spatial and temporal precision to understand how neural timescales are organized in the human brain (2) deep neural networks (DNN) which are the only models able to perform challenging perceptual tasks at human levels and predict neural responses in higher-order cortical regions. After completing this training, I will have a unique set of experimental (fMRI, ECoG, psychophysics) and computational skills (data-driven statistical modeling and hypothesis-driven DNN modeling), which will facilitate my transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Natural sounds like speech contain information at many different timescales (e.g. phonemes, syllables, words), but how the human brain extracts this information remains unclear. Understanding this process is critical to understanding how hearing impairment degrades speech perception. The proposed research will reveal the organization of neural timescales in the brain, and how this organization facilitates the coding of natural sounds like speech, which is a critical first step in understanding how this code is impaired by hearing loss.",Revealing the organization and functional significance of neural timescales in auditory cortex,9977571,K99DC018051,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Engineering', 'Family member', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Restaurants', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Voice', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'millisecond', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2020,125442,-0.0966134842342354
"Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology Project Summary Listening in noise is a core problem in everyday hearing. Sound sources of interest routinely occur amid irrelevant distractors, as when you talk with someone in a bustling coffee shop. This background “noise” distorts the pattern of spikes in the auditory nerve, often to a profound degree. Thus, to recognize sources of interest, the auditory system must somehow separate or suppress the effects of the background. Typical human hearing is remarkably noise-robust, but listeners with age-related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and are not much helped by contemporary hearing aids. Previous work on the neural basis of noise robustness has typically employed simple, synthetic noise sources, which lack the structure present in real-world sounds, and this work has focused on subcortical regions or on primary auditory cortex. Reasoning that real-world conditions might necessitate more complicated solutions, in the applicant's doctoral work, he considered everyday sources of noise, and leveraged the large-scale coverage afforded by fMRI to examine noise robustness throughout human auditory cortex. Real-world “background noise” was operationalized as a natural sound with statistical properties that are stable over time (i.e., are stationary), conveying little new information about the world (e.g., swamp insects, an air conditioner, rain on pavement). The applicant measured fMRI responses in human listeners to a broad set of natural sounds presented in quiet, as well as embedded in the real-world background noises. Primary auditory cortical responses were substantially altered by the background, but non-primary responses were substantially more robust. This effect was not seen for simple synthetic backgrounds as had been used in previous work, suggesting that becoming robust to real-world background noises require different mechanisms. The applicant's thesis work demonstrates where noise invariance arises, but understanding how will require data with finer spatial and temporal resolution, and thus the proposed postdoctoral research will consist of training in single-unit electrophysiology using marmosets. Aim 1A builds on previous work examining single- unit noise robustness in artificial conditions, extending such work to real-world noise. Aim 1B leverages texture models to probe what aspects of real-world backgrounds disrupt the encoding of foregrounds. Aim 2A deploys linear reconstruction techniques to probe population representations. Aim 2B involves optimizing deep neural networks for noise invariance tasks, and using them as an encoding model to predict single-unit responses. Furthermore, such networks will be deployed as nonlinear decoding algorithms, reconstructing stimuli from neuronal populations. Throughout all aims, the work will characterize neuronal responses in non-primary areas, and in particular in parabelt, which is understudied in primates. The proposed work may enable improvements in hearing aid algorithms or neural prosthetics. Lastly, this training will lay the groundwork for the applicant's long-term goal of developing a marmoset model for hearing loss. Project Narrative Typical human hearing is remarkably robust to the presence of background noise, but listeners with age- related hearing loss or other forms of impaired hearing struggle in noisy environments – and often do not benefit from contemporary hearing aids in these conditions. In my doctoral work, using fMRI in humans I showed that real-world background noise engages different mechanisms than the simpler synthetic noise typically employed in previous work. In my postdoctoral work I will be trained in marmoset electrophysiology to zoom in to the level of neural circuits to probe the mechanisms that generate auditory cortex's robustness to background noise.",Mechanisms for invariance in auditory cortex: Investigations with marmoset electrophysiology,10104430,F32DC017628,"['Acoustic Nerve', 'Address', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Prosthesis', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Aids', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Presbycusis', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Research', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'interest', 'neural circuit', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'sound', 'temporal measurement']",NIDCD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,64926,0.010989184685372768
"Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex PROJECT SUMMARY Humans with normal hearing excel at deriving information about the world from sound. Our auditory abilities represent stunning computational feats that only recently have been replicated to any extent in machine systems. And yet our auditory abilities are highly vulnerable, being greatly compromised in listeners with hearing impairment, cochlear implants, and auditory neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly in the presence of noise. Difficulties in recognition often lead to frustration and social isolation, and are not adequately addressed by current hearing aids, implants, and remediation strategies. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to reveal the basis of auditory recognition and to provide insights that will facilitate improved prosthetic devices and therapeutic interventions. The development of more effective devices and therapies is currently limited by an incomplete understanding of the factors that underlie real-world recognition by normal-hearing listeners. In particular, although responses to sound in subcortical auditory pathways are relatively well studied, little is known about the transformations that occur within the auditory cortex to create representations of meaningful sound structure. We propose to enrich the understanding of auditory recognition with three sets of experiments that examine the cortical representation of real-world sounds in human listeners, combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling of the underlying representations. Aim 1 develops artificial neural network models of speech and music processing and compares their representations to those in the auditory cortex, synthesizing and then measuring brain responses to sounds that generate the same response in a model, and probing the time scale of the auditory analysis of speech and music. Aim 2 develops and tests models of pitch perception in noise, exploring the hypothesis that pitch perception is constrained both by the statistics of natural sounds and the frequency selectivity of the cochlea. Aim 3 develops and tests models that jointly localize and recognize sounds, and probes the brain representations of sound identity and location using fMRI. The results will reveal the mechanisms underlying robust sound recognition by the healthy auditory system and will set the stage for investigations of the cortical consequences of hearing impairment and auditory developmental disorders, hopefully suggesting new strategies for remediation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: People with normal hearing are typically able to recognize, understand and localize sounds of interest, but this ability is often compromised in listeners with hearing disorders. The proposed research will enrich the understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying auditory recognition and localization in normal listeners. The results will likely provide insight into the brain processes whose alteration in hearing disorders underlies listening difficulties, potentially leading to improved remediation strategies.",Computational Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Auditory Cortex,9944496,R01DC017970,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Drops', 'Ear', 'Floor', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing Aids', 'Hearing Tests', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pitch Perception', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Social isolation', 'Sound Localization', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual Pathways', 'artificial neural network', 'auditory pathway', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational basis', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'sound', 'sound frequency', 'speech processing', 'statistics']",NIDCD,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,337875,-0.016470746069146905
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10071610,F99NS118740,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'memory recall', 'memory retrieval', 'movie', 'novel', 'portability', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,0.03238767171862783
"CRCNS: Network mechanisms of the learning and encoding of timed motor responses The brain is an inherently dynamic system, it evolved under strong selective pressures to allow animals to interact with the environment in real-time, and predict and prepare for future events. For these reasons, understanding neural dynamics, and how the brain tells and encodes time is fundamental to understanding brain function. The importance of neural dynamics and timing to brain function emphasizes the need for techniques that allow for the collection and analysis of massively parallel single neuron recordings across multiple structures in behaving animals. This project will combine novel electrophysiological, behavioral, analytical and computational methods to reverse engineer the neural circuits underlying learning and timing. The first aim is to combine large-scale neural recordings with computational approaches to determine how time is represented in the striatum and prefrontal cortex, two interacting brain areas that are closely implicated in temporal processing. We will specifically examine whether encoding of time relies on absolute, relative, or stimulus-specific coding mechanisms. Recordings will be carried out in awake, head-fixed mice trained on a classical trace reward conditioning task in which two cues predict reward with a different delay period. When animals learn the cue-reward association, they engage in robust anticipatory licking that precedes the reward presentation; moreover, the timing of this behavior is dependent on the cue-reward delay time. The second aim is to combine electrophysiology and optogenetics to determine if temporal coding in the striatum and prefrontal cortex is perturbed by transiently disrupting network activity. The hypothesis is that if dynamics of the timing circuits are perturbed then the ensuing activity patterns will be irreversibly altered, thus reducing the accuracy or precision of timed behavioral responses. The third aim is to develop a novel computational framework based on recurrent neural networks models that can predict ""future"" patterns of neural ensemble activity based on ""present"" patterns. The ultimate goal of this work is to integrate highly innovative electrophysiological and computational methods for reverse engineering brain circuit function at the level of networks of hundreds of neurons in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Learning to produce appropriately timed actions is fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and disruption of the brain circuits underlying this process is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.

"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations Project Summary/Abstract The mammalian brain builds and transforms representations of the outside world through the concerted activity of populations of neurons, but the extent to which spike times or spike counts are coordinated within these ensembles beyond pairs is not clear. Models of neural encoding predict variable frequencies of spike pattern occurrence, and models of decoding delineate requirements for spike time precision within the population response. While considerable effort has been made toward the development and refinement of the theoretical basis of such neural coding schemes, and predictions have been tested against single cell and pairwise data, there has been relatively little experimental data beyond pairs able to differentiate between competing hypotheses of population coding. The proposed career development plan aims to marry large-scale electrophysiology in primary visual cortex with analysis of specific predictions derived from computational and theoretical neuroscience work for spike time coordination beyond pairwise interactions. The candidate has a deep background in in vivo experimental techniques and proposes to receive training in the high-dimensional computational techniques and to use experimental data collected to validate specific theoretical predictions. This training will establish the skills necessary for a successful independent research career studying the mechanisms of information representation and transfer in visual cortex, bridging the gap between experimental and computational neuroscience. The candidate will carry out the mentored phase under the guidance of Dr. Clay Reid, a world expert in multiple aspects of mammalian central visual processing including anatomy, physiology, and computation. Additional advising from Dr. Eric Shea- Brown and Dr. Christof Koch will provide guidance in the theoretical and applied mathematical approaches required to implement and assess advanced models of neural encoding and decoding. The training will utilize the strengths of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in collecting large-scale data and the didactic opportunities at the University of Washington. In the independent phase the candidate will use the newly acquired analytical and modeling skills in combination with his previous training in optogenetic techniques to better constrain population measurements. This work will help establish a unique independent research program to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cortical representation. Project Narrative Understanding how the brain uses population activity to build representations of the outside world is an important step towards understanding not only sensory but also psychiatric and other cognitive disorders. This work on the fundamental nature of the neural code will contribute to the body of knowledge required to create effective brain interfaces for motor and sensory prostheses with the potential to reduce sensory disabilities, provide treatments for cognitive disorders, and aid in recovery from central nervous system trauma.",Millisecond resolution statistics of cortical populations,10006552,R00EY028612,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Impaired cognition', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Population Process', 'Population Statistics', 'Property', 'Psychophysics', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Disorders', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual Cortex', 'Washington', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'clay', 'computational neuroscience', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'mathematical methods', 'millisecond', 'neural model', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory prosthesis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'visual processing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,0.008962620032936242
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9819777,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,698101,0.020464476160095838
"Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data SUMMARY Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data. The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities, but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables, including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike trains). NARRATIVE Much mental health research relies on measurements of brain activity across different parts of the brain, and often poses difficult problems in statistical analysis. The research supported by this grant develops new methods of analyzing brain signals as they evolve across time. Of special interest is the way networks of interacting brain components may change under varying conditions.",Analysis of Nonstationary Point Process Data,10050798,R01MH064537,"['Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Structure', 'ImProv', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'interest', 'network dysfunction', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vector']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,373940,0.022903991523746815
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10015338,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,126090,0.03908914054128828
"CRCNS: Real-time neural decoding for calcium imaging Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Chen, Rong PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Real-time neural decoding centers on predicting behavior variables based on neural activity data, where the prediction is performed at a pace that reliably keeps up with the speed of the activity that is being monitored. Neuromodulation devices are becoming one of the most powerful tools for the treatment of brain disorders, enhancing neurocognitive performance, and demonstrating causality (Bergmann et al., 2016; Knotkova and Rasche, 2015). A precise neuromodulation system (Figure 1) integrates neural activity monitoring, real-time neural decoding, and neuromodulation. In precise neuromodulation, a decoding device predicts a behavior variable based on neural data streams in real-time. Based on the decoding results, neuromodulation parameters such as timing, frequency, duration, and amplitude are changed. Precise neuromodulation systems with closed-loop real-time feedback are superior to the fixed (open- loop) neuromodulation paradigm (Brocker et al., 2017; deBettencourt et al., 2015; Ezzyat et al., 2017). A recent direct brain stimulation study (Ezzyat et al., 2017) demonstrated significant advantages of precise neuromodulation over open-loop neuromodulation. Ezzyat et al. applied direct brain stimulation with decoding capability to patients with epilepsy to improve their memory. They found that stimulation increased memory function only if delivered when the decoding device indicated low encoding efficiency while stimulation decreased memory function if delivered when the decoding device indicated high encoding efficiency. An open-loop neuromodulation system with a fixed stimulation paradigm may not always facilitate memory function.  Miniature cellular imaging (Ghosh et al., 2011; Kerr and Nimmerjahn, 2012; Scott et al., 2013) is one of the most powerful ways to study neural circuits. It enables us to investigate neural circuits during behaviors for an understanding of network architecture of behavior, cognition, and emotion. Miniature cellular imaging records neuronal activity at cellular and sub-second levels of spatial and temporal resolution in freely moving animals. Miniature cellular imaging has many advantages. First, compared with in vivo multi-electrode recording, miniature calcium imaging can probe all cells in the field of view, and visualize the spatial location of monitored cells (Kerr et al., 2005). Second, compared with magnetic resonance imaging, which measures brain activity at the macroscopic scale and with low temporal resolution, miniature cellular imaging provides high spatial and temporal resolution. Third, fiber photometry (Cui et al., 2014) lacks cellular-level resolution, while miniature cellular imaging allows concurrent tracking of neural calcium activities at cellular spatial resolution.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,0.035600141596284204
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9983641,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,279706,0.04999976602467379
"Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning Project Summary Learning from rewards is one of the fundamental roles of the nervous system, allowing for beneficial behaviors to be repeated, and detrimental behaviors to be avoided. It has recently become clear that when humans learn from rewards in the environment, they rely on multiple neural systems that work in tandem. What are the psychological and biological constraints of these systems, and how do they interact during learning? The proposed experiments are designed to answer these questions by developing precise computational models of human instrumental learning, as well as investigating the neural dynamics of, and interactions between, individual learning processes. Aim 1 will focus on isolating individual learning processes, further developing a novel model of human instrumental learning that highlights contributions to learning from both a flexible executive working memory module and an incremental reinforcement learning module. Behavioral experiments and computational modeling will be used to better characterize these two learning processes, with a focus on how they interact instantaneously and over time. Aim 2 will use a combination of brain stimulation and neuroimaging to better characterize the neural systems supporting each learning process, as well as the putative interactions between these neural circuits. These results will constrain our understanding of the neural mechanisms that drive human instrumental learning. The knowledge gained by this project will provide a vital framework for clinical applications, for instance, in understanding and treating working memory related learning deficits in schizophrenia, and reinforcement learning deficits in Parkinson's disease. Critically, a more precise model of individual learning processes could guide the development of clinical protocols that leverage intact learning systems when other learning systems are compromised. Finally, an enhanced understanding of human reward-based learning could improve theories of habit formation, which may further inform psychological and neurophysiological models of addiction. Project Narrative This project will examine how multiple learning systems (e.g. working memory, incremental reinforcement learning) guide human instrumental learning, model these multiple learning systems computationally, and investigate their respective underlying neural mechanisms. The results will be useful not only for a better scientific understanding of learning deficits in psychological disorders like schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, but also for developing improved clinical protocols for leveraging intact neural circuits when others are compromised. Furthermore, an improved description of human reward-based learning will be relevant to understanding how habits are formed and reinforced, which may inform our understanding of the acquisition of addictive behaviors.",Modeling and mapping multiple computational processes in human reinforcement learning,9882891,F32MH119797,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study models', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical development', 'cognitive process', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'improved', 'in silico', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'visual motor', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F32,2020,20742,0.058099614013702575
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,9991327,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73106,0.041630134547342226
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9989900,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience PROJECT SUMMARY Neuroscience is producing increasingly complex data sets, including measures and manipulations of sub- cellular, cellular, and multi-cellular mechanisms operating over multiple timescales and in the context of different behaviors and task conditions. These data sets pose several fundamental challenges. First, for a given data set, what are the relevant spatial, temporal, and computational scales in which the underlying information-processing dynamics are best understood? Second, what are the best ways to design and select models to account for these dynamics, given the inevitably limited, noisy, and uneven spatial and temporal sampling used to collect the data? Third, what can increasingly complex data sets, collected under increasingly complex conditions, tells us about how the brain itself processes complex information? The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate new, theoretically grounded methods to help researchers to overcome these challenges. Our primary hypothesis is that resolving, modeling, and interpreting relevant information- processing dynamics from complex data sets depends critically on approaches that are built upon understanding the notion of complexity itself. A key insight driving this proposal is that definitions of complexity that come from different fields, and often with different interpretations, in fact have a common mathematical foundation. This common foundation implies that different approaches, from direct analyses of empirical data to model fitting, can extract statistical features related to computational complexity that can be compared directly to each other and interpreted in the context of ideal-observer benchmarks. Starting with this idea, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) establish a common theoretical foundation for analyzing both data and model complexity; 2) develop practical, complexity-based tools for data analysis and model selection; and 3) establish the usefulness of complexity-based metrics for understanding how the brain processes complex information. Together, these Aims provide new theoretical and practical tools for understanding how the brain integrates information across large temporal and spatial scales, using formal, universal definitions of complexity to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of complex neural and behavioral data sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed work will establish new, theoretically grounded computational tools to help neuroscience researchers design and analyze studies of brain function. These tools, which will be made widely available to the neuroscience research community, will help support a broad range of studies of the brain, enhance scientific discovery, and promote rigor and reproducibility.","Mental, measurement, and model complexity in neuroscience",10002220,R01EB026945,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'data tools', 'design', 'information processing', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,20957,0.0006357710710929324
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation Project Summary  Over the course of our lifetimes, we are bound to experience distressing, negative events we would rather not remember over and over again. Importantly, there is variability in people’s ability to cope with these memories. How do people regulate negative emotional memories, and why are some people better at dealing with negative memories than others? For my dissertation, I will investigate these questions through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, specifically looking at how memory reactivation strength can predict one’s ability to deal with negative memories. Prior work from the Norman Lab has postulated a U-shaped relationship between memory reactivation strength and the fate of a memory: Moderate reactivation leads to memory weakening while strong reactivation leads to strengthening. This proposal examines the impact of memory reactivation strength in 3 studies: In Study 1, I focus on memory suppression, a coping strategy where people try to stop an unwanted memory from coming to mind after it has been triggered by a cue in the environment. I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to relate the neural measure of memory reactivation during a memory suppression task to subsequent memory reactivation. In this study, for which data collection should be completed by the start of the F99 Phase, I will also examine the impact of inter-subject differences in depression level; prior research has shown that depressed participants appear to demonstrate a negative bias, which might be relevant to how strongly memories are reactivated. In Study 2, I will shift my focus to study cognitive reappraisal, an alternative strategy whereby participants reframe the interpretation of a negative event to mitigate the emotional intensity tied to its memory. Although this strategy requires bringing a memory to mind so that it can be reinterpreted, the impact of memory reactivation on cognitive reappraisal has not been well studied. I will use fMRI to investigate this gap in the literature, using data from a study for which data collection is already underway in the Ritchey Lab. Finally, in Study 3, I will use the eye tracker to study whether the application of temporally targeted visual stimuli can be used to modify subsequent memory performance by modulating memory reactivation strength. Prior research has demonstrated the relevance of using eye-tracking, which has finer temporal resolution and is more accessible than fMRI, to examine memory reactivation. Put together, this work will provide more insight into how memory reactivation strength influences the fate of negative memories, specifically after engaging in memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal. It will also elucidate ways in which memory reactivation can be leveraged and optimized in different coping strategies for dealing with unwanted, negative memories. The expertise of my sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborator will be pivotal to my development as a researcher and the success of my dissertation work. In the K00 Phase, I will expand my knowledge of mental health disorders so that I can be equipped to become an independent researcher at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health disorders. Project Narrative  For my dissertation, I will investigate inter-subject and inter-trial differences in memory reactivation strength and how this variability affects memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal efficacy. This work will help to identify ways in which memory reactivation can be optimally leveraged to help people cope with negative, unwanted memories. Specifically, this work might provide ways to personalize interventions for patients with mental health disorders, such as depression, to increase the therapeutic impact.",The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation,10155909,F99NS120647,"['Affect', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Distress', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prize', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'coping', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'personalized intervention', 'posters', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'visual stimulus', 'visual tracking']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,0.02282233043588778
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.06069719907062683
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,0.01720430258788235
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning.

"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis. We aim to test our central hypothesis that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence that supports multiple confidence-guided behavioral processes.",Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence,10058676,R01MH097061,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Wages', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'deaf', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sound', 'success']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,500079,0.0654506385447375
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9994009,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,129087,0.04498093221678591
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9891099,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2020,355558,0.0020915013796380245
"Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion PROJECT SUMMARY Little is known about the neural mechanisms that regulate natural dynamic cues during human social and emotional interactions, although these mechanisms are impaired in many psychiatric and neurological disorders. Although it is widely understood that social signals such as facial expressions carry salient, but implicit, emotional and social cues, these “real-time” pathways have not been investigated with dual-brain neuroimaging techniques. This unmet need is largely due to technological limitations that prevent neuroimaging of two or more individuals during natural interactive situations. We overcome this technical “roadblock” with recent advances in an emerging human brain imaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). This non-invasive technique detects active neural tissue based on hemodynamic signals measured by variations in the absorption spectra associated with oxyhemoglobin and de-oxyhemoglobin. Because detectors and emitters are surface mounted on the head, absent a high magnetic field, they are relatively insensitive to head movement and thus successfully applied to dyadic experiments. The focus of this proposal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that underlie dynamic cross-brain neural coupling during real interpersonal interactions. Cross-brain neural coupling is defined as the correlation between the temporal patterns of the signals of two brains. It has been proposed that these matched patterns represent shared neural processes including dynamic exchanges of information. However, the basic assumptions of shared information and temporal resonance patterns between specific brain-to-brain regions has not been tested. We pioneer tests of these hypothesis using eye-to-eye contact as a metric of shared information and predict that dynamic neural coupling between the two brains will increase with increasing numbers of eye-to-eye contact events. Mimicry of facial expressions is also a metric of emotional contagion as well as shared information between brains. We further test the hypothesis that neural coupling will increase with the level of mimicry also by virtue of the shared information Confirmation of the hypothesis that neural coupling represents shared information between the two brains would provide a singular advance for understanding mechanisms for dynamic interactions. Both approaches include variations of emotive expressions to test the additional hypothesis that content as well as shared information might influence dynamic coupling mechanisms. Findings from these studies are expected to open a new direction for the study of live and dynamic interactions between individuals, and provide foundational components to a general framework for models of face-to-face interactions. A long-term goal is to understand the neural underpinnings of affective disorders as they present in clinically-relevant and real-world situations. Project Narrative How do two brains interact? We pioneer a novel neuroimaging technology, near infrared spectroscopy, to investigate basic mechanisms of neural coupling between two dynamically interacting individuals. Using these new methods we test the fundamental hypothesis that neural coupling (temporal synchrony between two brains) represents shared information across the two brains.",Mechanisms of Dynamic Neural Coupling during Face-to-Face Expressions of Emotion,9883842,R01MH119430,"['Affective', 'Arousal', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Eyebrow structure', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Negative Valence', 'Oral cavity', 'Oxyhemoglobin', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Social Interaction', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'contagion', 'detector', 'dyadic interaction', 'emotional reaction', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'magnetic field', 'mimicry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,400249,0.022380951027933624
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,-0.03112871382079701
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,9955382,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,386750,0.05530468746817703
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9842566,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,0.046243025313450724
"Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework PROJECT SUMMARY Anxiety disorders affect an estimated 6.7% to 7.3% of people globally each year and incur a large burden on people’s lives. To address this urgent problem, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the neural bases of subjective experiences in anxiety, including threat perception. Translational neuroscience has focused on animal models of defensive behavior involving a core set of regions. Although these animal models and the human subjects research they inspired have led to advances in treatment of anxiety, the mapping between neural mechanisms and subjective experience remains poorly understood. The set of regions found to support defensive behavior in animal models does not appear to be involved in all instances of fear or anxiety. The current project overcomes this barrier by integrating current models of anxiety with predictive coding models of the mind and brain. Incorporating predictive coding into models of anxiety will offer a better understanding of how neural activity relates to subjective experiences important to anxiety (e.g., threat perception). The project tests two parallel hypotheses about neural representation of threat perception suggested by predictive coding models: that neural representations of threat perception are content-specific (Aim 1) and that neural representations of threat perception depend on expectations (Aim 2). Using a single design, we manipulate content-specificity and expectations to test these two hypotheses in parallel. We use fMRI to measure brain activity and use self-report and peripheral psychophysiology to measure subjective experiences of threat perception. To the extent that participants find stimuli threatening (as indexed by self-report and psychophysiology), we hypothesize that we will observe relatively content-specific neural representations of threat. We also hypothesize that neural representations of threat will differ under conditions of expectation vs. expectancy violation. The effect of expectation may impact content-specific neural activity or activity in a core set of regions. The knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential improve understanding of the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences. Relevant for translational neuroscience, a better understanding of the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety will be critical to closing the gap between laboratory research and more effective treatments for anxiety. More broadly, predictive coding models are models of basic brain function. Thus, the predictive coding model we propose offers a new theoretical framework that is generalizable to psychiatric illnesses involving disordered threat perception (e.g., schizophrenia) and other affective disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder). PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent work suggests that the effectiveness of treatments for anxiety has been over-estimated10-13 and development of new treatments have stalled5-8, in part, because the mapping between neural activity and subjective experiences that produce anxiety (e.g., perceiving threats) remains poorly understood. The proposed project addresses this gap in knowledge by examining the neural basis of a subjective experience important anxiety and anxiety disorders (threat perception) using a model of brain function from cognitive neuroscience. In doing so, the proposed project offers a novel theoretical framework that allows for better modeling of the relationship between neural activity and subjective experiences (e.g., threat perception) in anxiety, which has the potential to advance understanding of the mechanisms that drive anxiety and anxiety disorders.",Advancing understanding of neural representations of threat perception through a novel predictive coding framework,10068854,F32MH122062,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Emotions', 'Expectancy', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human Subject Research', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Placebo Effect', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'anxiety treatment', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'expectation', 'experience', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'neural model', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pain processing', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'training project', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,64926,0.05498422054824564
"Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of sensation from the limbs. The past 15 years have seen remarkable advances in “Brain Machine Interfaces” (BMIs) that allow paralyzed persons to move anthropomorphic limbs using signals recorded directly from their brains. However, these movements remain slow, clumsy, and effortful, looking remarkably like those of individuals who have lost sensation from their arms due to peripheral neuropathy. Brain-controlled prosthetic limbs are unlikely to achieve high levels of performance in the absence of artificial sensory feedback. Early attempts at restoring somatosensation used intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to activate somatosensory cortex (s1), requiring animals to learn largely arbitrary patterns of stimulation to represent two or three virtual objects or to navigate in two-dimensional space. While an important beginning, this approach seems unlikely to scale to the broad range of limb movements and interactions with objects that we experience in daily life.  To move the field past this hurdle, we propose to replace both touch and proprioception by using multi- electrode ICMS to produce naturalistic patterns of neuronal activity in S1 of monkeys. In Aim 1, we will develop model-optimized mappings between limb state (pressure on the fingertip, or motion of the limb) and the patterns of ICMS required to evoke S1 activation that mimics that of natural inputs. These maps will account for both the dynamics of neural responses and the biophysics of ICMS. We anticipate that this biomimetic approach will evoke intuitive sensations that require little or no training to interpret. We will validate the maps by comparing natural and ICMS-evoked S1 activity using novel hardware that allows for concurrent ICMS and neural recording. In Aim 2, we will test the ability of monkeys to recognize objects using artificial touch. Having learned to identify real objects by touch, animals will explore virtual objects with an avatar that shadows their own hand movements, receiving artificial touch sensations when the avatar contacts objects. We will test their initial performance on the virtual stereognosis task without learning, as well as their improvements in performance over time. Aim 3 will be similar, but will focus on proprioception. We will train monkeys to report the direction of brief force bumps applied to their hand. After training, we will replace the actual bumps with virtual bumps created by patterned ICMS, again asking the monkeys to report their perceived sense of the direction and magnitude of the perturbation. Finally, in Aim 4, we will temporarily paralyze the monkey's arm, thereby removing both touch and proprioception, mimicking the essential characteristics of a paralyzed patient. The avatar will be controlled based on recordings from motor cortex and guided by artificial somatosensation. The monkey will reach to a set of virtual objects, find one with a particular shape, grasp it, and move it to a new location. If we can demonstrate that this model-optimized, biomimetic feedback is informative and easy to learn, it should form the basis for robust, scalable, somatosensory feedback for BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Spinal cord injury causes both paralysis and loss of feeling from the limbs (somatosensation); brain machine interfaces (BMIs), which record signals directly from the brain, can be used to control prosthetic devices, computers, or environmental controls. However, BMIs currently do not restore somatosensation, a critical component of normal limb movement. We propose to develop a new type of brain interface that will mimic the somatosensory brain activity generated during movement and provide natural and informative artificial sensation for people with paralysis or limb amputation.",Biomimetic Somatosensory Feedback through Intracorticalmicrostimulation,9932509,R01NS095251,"['Achievement', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biomimetics', 'Biophysics', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cutaneous', 'Electrodes', 'Esthesia', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nerve Block', 'Neurons', 'Numbness', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases', 'Persons', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Proprioception', 'Prosthesis', 'Quadriplegia', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'infancy', 'limb amputation', 'limb movement', 'microstimulation', 'mind control', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prosthesis control', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory feedback', 'somatosensory', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'visual feedback']",NINDS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,615717,0.002320471081249609
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9983219,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,1025216,0.024926931536695857
"Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior Project Summary/Abstract In order to control specific behavioral responses, transcriptionally distinct cell types assembled into dynamic brain circuits integrate environmental information with internal states and generate purposeful motor actions. While tools have been developed to independently measure the activity dynamics, connectivity and transcriptional profiles of individual neurons, it remains challenging to integrate this diverse information into a coherent model of behavior. To address this challenge, we aim to uncover the sensorimotor transformations leading to a complex naturalistic behavior, male and female parenting, by developing innovative molecular, imaging and systems-level approaches and by integrating multimodal information obtained from single neurons in behaving animals. In aim 1, we will develop new tools to uncover the activity and the transcriptional identity of neuronal cell types involved in infant-mediated behavior. In aim 2, we will explore in molecular, functional, and behavioral terms how olfactory and other sensory modalities underlie parenting behavior in males and females and in virgin versus mated states. In aim 3, we will investigate how specific hypothalamic cell types process information reflecting behavioral outcomes using a combination of spatial transcriptomic, functional imaging, circuit tracing and behavioral methods. In aim 4, we will combine cell-type based neuronal architecture with activity patterns across key brain regions to formulate predictive models underlying the neural control of parenting. Project Narrative We propose to develop a transformative multimodal experimental platform to uncover the brain-wide architecture of neuronal circuits underlying parenting behavior in molecular, functional, connectivity-based and computational terms. We will use this experimental framework to shed light into the sensory motor transformation underlying parenting behavior as a function of the animal sex and physiological state.",Systems-level and in situ transcriptomics deconstruction of neural circuits underlying sensorimotor transformation in an innate behavior,9971196,R01NS116593,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Child Rearing', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Discipline', 'Fathers', 'Female', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Instinct', 'Investigation', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'male', 'microendoscopy', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuroregulation', 'olfactory bulb glomeruli', 'predictive modeling', 'pup', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptomics']",NINDS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2444289,0.021881841568362453
"Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making Project Summary Working memory, the ability to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation, is central to virtually all cognitive abilities. Recent technical advances have opened an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively dissect the neural circuit mechanisms of this ability across multiple brain areas. The task to be studied is a common form of decision-making that is based on the gradual accumulation of sensory evidence and thus relies on working memory. A team of leading experts propose to investigate the neural basis of this behavior using the latest techniques, including virtual reality, high-throughput automated behavioral training, large-scale cellular-resolution imaging in behaving rodents, manipulation of neural activity in specific brain areas and cell types, and automated anatomical reconstruction. In particular, the researchers will identify key brain regions that are required for this decision task through systematic, temporally specific inactivations via optogenetics technology, across all of dorsal cortex and in key subcortical areas, and use quantitative model-fitting to evaluate the effects. They will use state-of-the-art two-photon calcium imaging methods and electrophysiology to characterize the information flow in many individual neurons within these brain areas during the task. In addition, they will use cutting-edge anatomical reconstructions and new functional connectivity methods, within and across brain regions, to evaluate the interactions of these physiologically characterized neurons. The long-term goal of this project is to arrive at a complete, brain-wide understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of activity dynamics related to working memory. Finally, they will use sophisticated computational methods to incorporate this new understanding into a realistic circuit model that will support a tightly integrated process of model-guided experimental design, in which the model suggests the most informative experiments and their results are then fed back to improve the model’s fidelity. This process is expected to produce the most accurate and detailed multi-brain-region biophysical circuit model of a cognitive process in existence. In addition, the proposed research will enable researchers to generate and test a variety of hypotheses about the neural basis of evidence accumulation, working memory, and decision-making. Taken together, these achievements will represent a crucial step toward a mechanistic understanding of how the brain works with information. Working memory, the capacity to temporarily hold multiple pieces of information in mind for manipulation , is central to almost all cognitive abilities. Many mental diseases, including Alzheimer’s, schizophrenia, dementia, bipolar depression, autism, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, involve working memory. The major goal of this project is to determine how the brain produces decisions based on working memory, via a coordinated effort by multiple researchers to observe, map, perturb, and model brain circuits with state-of-the-art technologies, which will provide critical clues to therapeutic approaches and constitute a major advance in basic science.",Mechanisms of neural circuit dynamics in working memory anddecision-making,9983177,U19NS104648,"['Achievement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cerebellum', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Experimental Designs', 'Goals', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'cost effectiveness', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'information processing', 'instrumentation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'social computing', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,U19,2020,3062362,0.03386105298889402
"The Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration at Houston Methodist Project Summary/Abstract This R13 was conceived through discussions with investigators in the fields of neurostimulation and neuroplasticity at the Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI). In 2017, we held an R13-funded pilot workshop that combined research in neural stimulation with new insight into the molecular understanding of neural plasticity and regeneration. The results of said workshop indicated a strongly positive response by participants and interest in further catalysts of working collaboration. Thus, in 2019 we introduced new ways to increase relationship development and crossover opportunities among attendees, one of which was a blitz session wherein newly formed (i.e., established at the 2019 Workshop) collaborative teams competed for two $5K mini grants that supported travel to and from each other’s institutions. Given the overwhelmingly positive feedback, this will continue. On March 3rd-6th 2021, we will host the third Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration (Zusman Workshop) with a focus on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics and molecular neural plasticity. Our specific aims are to: 1) formulate new ideas to fill the gap between physiology and functional-based brain stimulation technologies and the molecular and cellular understanding of innate neuronal plasticity; 2) integrate promising trainees into plenary sessions; and 3) ensure trainees participate in substantial discussions and interactions with faculty members. As in previous workshops, the 2021 Workshop will be held at HMRI. HMRI is part of the Texas Medical Center (TMC), a one-of-its-kind medical and research hub that fosters cross-institutional collaboration, creativity, and innovation located in one of the United States’ most diverse cities: Houston Texas. A key aspect of the Zusman Workshop is the active inclusion and participation of trainees, particularly women and under-represented minorities. We will encourage their participation through travel scholarships and via active promotion and recruitment throughout the TMC. Also, the Workshop seeks to promote the voices of graduate and postdoctoral trainees. As such, the 2021 Workshop will include several trainee poster sessions as well as a session dedicated to trainee presentations (given by travel awardees). Further, goal-oriented breakout sessions led by senior/early-stage investigators and selected trainees will foster discussion and promote cross-trainingand collaborationamong participants. Overall, the format of this workshop is distinct from established physiology conferences and dedicated neural regeneration conferences in several ways. It is: 1) highly focused on the gap between molecular regeneration and electrophysiology/stimulation, 2) concept driven by clinicians and experimentalists currently problem solving in human therapy, and 3) focused on the establishment of cross training and expertise development in graduate, post-graduate, and clinical fellows. We believe the 2021 Zusman Workshop will ignite collaborative networks between investigators and produce novel collaborative teams that will develop innovative, transdisciplinary methods, technologies, and treatments to modulate performance in the damaged nervous system. Project Narrative A large gap exists between researchers who seek to develop methods of neural plasticity and long-distance regeneration and experts who study the outcomes and safety of brain computer interfaces. Therefore, in 2017, we developed and held the first biannual Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration, which focused on the intersection of electrical activity, brain connectomics, and molecular neural plasticity. In 2021, our goals are to 1) build upon the success of our previous two workshops by inviting back and sponsoring travel for rising star alumni to return and participate; 2) create an interdisciplinary discussion of the gap in these disciplines, and 3) stimulate working groups, training opportunities, and translational approaches to speed progress in directed, stimulation-based regenerative therapies.",The Patricia Levy Zusman International Workshop on Neuroregeneration at Houston Methodist,10070437,R13NS118763,"['Acceleration', 'Adjuvant', 'Animal Model', 'Axon', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Creativeness', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Institution', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodist Church', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Movement Disorders', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Regeneration', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome Study', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Problem Solving', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Safety', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Study Section', 'Technology', 'Texas', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'brain machine interface', 'catalyst', 'cellular engineering', 'clinical application', 'college', 'combinatorial', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'human model', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'member', 'neural stimulation', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'posters', 'recruit', 'regenerative therapy', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'training opportunity', 'translational approach', 'working group']",NINDS,METHODIST HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R13,2020,20000,0.016354096283397936
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,0.03523445105890879
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9906925,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2020,660316,0.012863037792247223
