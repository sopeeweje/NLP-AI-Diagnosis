"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.  We believe we can design a system of this type to sell for approximately $10,000.  This would bring powerful image processing technology within the reach of many more investigators.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"CLONAL KARYOTYPIC EVOLUTION IN HUMAN SOLID TUMORS Detailed cytogenetic banding analysis will be applied to a variety of human cancers to assess directly clonal karyotypic abnormalities.  Sequential chromosome studies will be conducted using a new cytogenetic procedure which samples tumor cells grown in an in vitro bioassay capable of supporting colony formation from a wide variety of human cancers.  Specific time points for sequential analysis will be:  (1)\at diagnosis (prior to therapy); (2)\following cessation of therapy (if measurable residual disease); and (3)\at relapse.  Patients with solid tumors and malignant effusions from breast, ovary, and lung cancer or patients with neuroblastoma will be studied.  The objectives are to assess the clonal karyotypic evolution in primary and metastatic lesions as a response to time and treatment.  Additionally, the karyology of tumor colony-forming cells exposed but resistant to in vitro incubation with various chemotherapeutic agents will be compared to unexposed control cultures. Selective action of these drugs on karyotypic clonal expansion or contraction will be assessed and results compared to measurable in vivo selection at the time of recurrence of disease.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.

"VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM AND FLUID SHEAR STRESS IN VITRO The structural and functional alterations of vascular endothelium caused by fluid shear stress will be investigated in vitro using cultured endothelial cells and a special apparatus we have developed for producing controlled fluid shear stress.  The apparatus utilizes a shallow cone rotating above a flat plate to produce shear stresses between 10 to the -2 and 200 dynes/cm2; both laminar and turbulent flow conditions can be checked. Additional modifications will provide oscillating and alternating shear stress levels to investigate the response of the cells to shear conditions approximating those existing in vivo.  Specific parameters of endothelial structure and function to be measured include:  growth patterns and growth kinetics; migration and mitosis following injury; cell orientation and morphology; rates and mechanisms of endocytosis; cytoskeletal organization; and interaction with extracellular matrix.  This is a collaborative research effort that draws upon the resources, expertise, and experience of the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Vascular Pathophysiology Laboratory, Brigham and Women's Hospital.  The research system to be used in this program, comprised of an accurately controlled fluid shear stress apparatus and well defined cultured endothelial specimens, should yield valuable information on the influence of fluid shear stress on the structure and function of vascular endothelium.

"S U MEDICAL EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER RESOURCE (SUMEX) Stanford University maintains a national shared computing resource in partnership with the NIH Biotechnology Resources Program to explore advanced applications of computer science in health research.  There are two main objectives of the facility:  1) the managerial, administrative and technical demonstration of a national shared technological resource for health research and 2) the specific encouragement of applications of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM).  Besides the economic advantages of resource sharing made possible by emerging data communication technologies, a closer interaction between diverse research efforts is expected to promote a more systematic exchange of research products and ideas.  This may be particularly true in applications of computer science.  Multi-lateral community building rather than unilateral service is the project's essential mandate.  The term ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) is applied to research aimed at increasing the computer's effectiveness as a tool through the emulation of aspects of human symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.  The field emphasizes the judgmental manipulation of symbolic (non-numeric) representations of knowledge of a task domain for model-building and decision-making.  Current applications include programs which assist in inferring chemical structures from mass spectral or x-ray crystallographic data, suggesting diagnoses and treatments within various classes of diseases, and modeling aspects of human behavior patterns.

"CENTER FOR STUDY OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE & STROKE This is a competitive continuation proposal for a Center for the Study of Cerebrovascular Disease and Stroke.  The goals are the prevention of stroke and the development of effective treatment for stroke and its consequences.  Both laboratory studies and clinical studies are outlined in the request.  We propose to study, by the use of appropriate animal models problems of the blood vessels supplying the brain that cannot be well studied in humans.  These projects relate to:  1) the routes of fluid and solute transfer between blood vessels and perivascular space; 2) changes produced in blood vessels by hypertension and diabetes and the development of vascular disease over time as shown by scanning and electron microscopy; 3) the alteration in the endothelial cell glycocalyx that are caused by hemodynamic changes and may underlie the location of atherosclerosis or clots.  The clinically related projects use the techniques of artificial intelligence in computer aided decision making, data banking and clinical study of patients with the tools of psychiatry and neuropsychology.  These projects will utilize data collected from a group of stroke patients to study:  1) aphasia and the cognitive deficit underlying it, the current classification and aspects of symptom change in recovery; 2) depression poststroke including the identification of risk factors, the biological correlates, comparison with control groups, genetics, and treatment; 3) computer aided decision making in stroke including development of new artificial intelligence techniques, developing and testing multiple computer programs to assist in assessing and managing patients with stroke and develop new ways of using these systems in clinical and educational settings.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"AUTOMATED CANCER CELL DIAGNOSIS BY THE TICAS METHOD The goal of this research is to study high-resolution image analysis of cervical cells for diagnostic assessment of patients.  The discovery of the marker features for the presence of dysplasia or malignant disease expressed in ""normal appearing"" intermediate cells from the ectocervix has affected the very strategy of prescreening for cervical cancer.  If confirmed on a large database of patients, the finding of frank tumor cells could be replaced by the statistical assessment of a limited sample of a patient's intermediate cells to ascertain whether visual review of the patient's sample is required.  Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.

Using a vibrotactile array of stimulators that fit against the subjects' fingertips, complex patterns varying in duration, mode of generation, intensity, size, temporal proximity to masking stimuli, and location will be presented to subjects who are required to identify the patterns.  The role of pattern onset in generating vibrotactile contours and the limits of temporal integration of vibrotactile patterns will be investigated.  Measurements will be made of temporal masking functions with patterned stimuli, and a two-factor model of masking will be tested. Spatial factors such as the locus of stimulation and the size of patterns as well as the interaction between these factors and temporal and intensive variables will be explored.  The role of experience in tactile pattern recognition will be examined by testing individuals who have had extensive experience with the Optacon, a reading aid for the blind, with some of the pattern recognition tasks on which sighted subjects have been tested.  The project will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile and visual pattern perception.  The project will also be concerned with the improvement of cutaneous communication systems and devices, particularly as these might be used by individuals with sensory handicaps.

"THE ROLE OF THE HAPTIC SYSTEM IN COMMUNICATION The major research effort in this project is directed at the fundamental problem of the processing of complex tactile stimulus patterns in real-time for use as correlates of environmental information by handicapped or normal persons working under a sensory overload. To determine what characteristics of patterns provide reliable and rapidly processed units of information, a computer-controlled vibrotactile matrix has been constructed to permit presentation of a wide variety of frequencies, amplitudes, and time relations of tactile stimuli over a spatial display of 64 independently controlled vibrators.  Present explorations of promising pattern dimensions involve serial presentations of patterns for discrimination and identification, but future work will involve pattern production and modification in dynamic simulated environmental representations.  A variety of basic problems that have appeared as by-products of the main effort also receive attention, viz., threshold and ""loudness"" summation in the presence of multiple contactors, spatial mislocalizations as space-time trade-offs, judgments of texture and distance on the skin, and the influence of mechanical skin characteristics on basic psychophysical functions.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.  Phase I objective is to breadboard this system (without) the signal-to-noise ratio improvement) and test it on a manikin, equipped with a ANSI S3.25-1979 simulator.

"A ROTATING SLIT SCANNING UNIT FOR DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY The purpose of the research we are proposing is the development of a rotational slit scanning system for digital radiographic applications.  The x-ray receptors will consist of linear photodiode arrays coated with an x-ray phosphor.  The system should be compact and of low cost compared to commercially available linear scanning units.  The spatial resolution imaging capabilities of such a device should exceed one 1p/mm, while offering shorter scan times than conventional linear scanning units.  The benefits expected from such a system would include:  1. significant reduction in the detection of compton scattered x-rays (which will degrade image contrast and increase dose)  2. scan rates sufficient to minimize many patient motion problems  3. an increase in the dynamic range available over that of film  4. adequate spatial resolution for many radiologic applications  Since the same coated arrays may be employed in a linear scan format, direct comparison of image quality between the two scanning formats for the same receptor technology will be possible.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.  A set of template analyses dealing with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, renal transplantation, use of anticoagulant therapy and the timing of surgery for valvular heart disease, and a knowledge base of risk and prognosis estimates in these domains will also be constructed.

"TWO DIMENSIONAL PHOTON COUNTING POSTITION ENCODER A two-dimensional Photon Counting Position Encoder is proposed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical cameras.  The new detector uses three new concepts:  1) a method of controlling the spatial distribution of photons from Bismuth Germanate Scintillators, 2) the use of all digital photon counting for processing the photomultiplier signal, and 3) the use of pattern recognition to encode position.  The new detector is expected to reduce the cost of this portion of the PET scanner by approximately a factor of eight.  The cost reduction anticipated for a typical four ring camera will be in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000 which is 20-40 percent of the cost of the PET scanner.

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource will promote the developement and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed research.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg & G. Sharp at the University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have a major collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototypes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system on a chip, incorporated in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analysizer.  We have also succeeded in transferring the large rheumotology consultation knowledge base onto a M68000 microprocessor machine, which will be accessible and affordable to smaller investigative groups and clinicians.  We are proposing to continue these innovations through experimentation with different kinds of microprocessor systems, introducing better graphics and other user-friendly interfaces.  These systems will be tested and evaluated by our biomedical collaborators.  In addition to the research in the Resource, we intend to continue the highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series, and the Rutgers participation in national AIM collaborative research.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.

"RECONSTRUCTION AND DISPLAY IN TOMOGRAPHIC RADIOLOGY This is a renewal application for a grant currently entitled ""Computer Technology for Transaxial Tomography"".  The change in title to ""Reconstruction and Display in Tomographic Radiology"" reflects a shift in the nature of the proposed work.  We propose to cover various modalities in radiology--namely, computerized tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)--all of which are tomographic in the sense that they produce images of slices through the human body.  ""Reconstruction"" in the title of the proposal is to be interpreted as the procedure to produce such images from the measured raw data in CT, PET, and MRI.  ""Display"" in the title is to be interpreted as the procedure to put together in three-dimensional (3D)--or (including time) 4D--space the information that exists in the individual slices.  In ""reconstruction"" we plan to concentrate on finite series expansion methods, methods derived from a semi-continuous formulation, preprocessing of incomplete or distorted data, with applications to CT, PET, and MRI.  In ""display"" we plan to concentrate on segmentation (identification of structures of interest, such as specific organs and tumors, in the 3D space) and on rapid display, analysis, and manipulation of the identified structures, with applications to measurement of volumetric changes in soft-tissue masses, surgical planning, radiation therapy treatment planning, and characterization of the normal, ischemic and scarred myocardium.

"CERVICAL CANCER DETECTION AND SCREENING (PHASE II) The objective of this research is to develop new and improved diagnostic instrumentation for cervical cancer detection and screening.  The techniques employed are based upon high-resolution digital imaging technology.  A 5-year study just completed has clarified and quantified, for the purposes of cytology automation, the concepts exploited in traditional human cervical cytology screening, i.e., the detection requirements of the Pap smear screening ""system"", the cell detection capabilities of trained cytotechnologists, and the interrelationship of these factors.  In addition, these studies proved that state-of-the-art image processing detection of suspicious and abnormal cells is as good as, or better than, highly trained cytotechnologists.  The research and development, herein (Phase II), is to further specific aspects of the computer software design and to develop the conceptual design of a feasible diagnostic instrument.  The expected results from the Phase II development would be completed software algorithms and other system parameters in a specific design.  The potential commercial application of this research is in the area of clinical laboratory instrumentation and testing.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE Attention and effort on this computer program for consultative diagnosis in medicine have been focused during the past year on two areas primarily, (a) the development of the new CADUCEUS program, and (b) the expansion and updating of the medical knowledge base. Prototypic computer programs have been written for the operation of CADUCEUS and have been preliminarily tested.  A substantial portion of the medical knowledge base (diseases of the liver and biliary tract) has been reorganized in the CADUCEUS format.  The installation of a dedicated VAX computer this summer will allow these programs to be tested critically and then further work can proceed on both elements. The knowledge base in internal medicine has been expanded so that it now includes over 500 diseases and some 3,450 individual manifestations of disease. Many disease entities which were programmed some years ago have been updated. It is gratifying but not unexpected that this expansion and updating have improved the performance of INTERNIST-I.  The pediatrics knowledge base has been significantly expanded also.  Considerable progress has been made on an anatomy knowledge base for utilization in CADUCEUS.  Progress has also been made on the reorganization of the diagnostic program to a form utilizable for educational and testing purposes by medical students and physicians.

"KINEMATIC AND CELLULAR STUDIES OF MOTOR CONTROL The main goal is to understand how the central nervous system coordinates the large number of degrees of freedom of the arm.  The experimental approach includes recording and analysis of the kinematics of multijoint movements.  In some cases, a simple mechanical system is used to record the movements.  When full arm freedom is required, an optoelectric recording system is used.  Work will continue on the following projects on multijoint control.  1. Multijoint movements of the right and left arms are being compared.  The comparison includes movements to visual targets, movements which are unexpectedly perturbed, and isometric force production.  2. Studies of the multijoint movements of patients with movement disorders will be continued.  To date, there has been concentration on patients with cerebellar disease and Parkinson's disease.  Simple movements to visual targets have been emphasized.  In the next year, unexpectedly perturbed movements and isometric force production will be studied in these same patient groups, in order to more fully characterize the physiology of these disorders.  3. We are studying the control of multijoint movements in the presence of unexpected mechanical loads.  We recently found that with same load types subjects make movements with the same kinematic characteristics as in the unloaded condition.  This suggests that there may be a mechanism for rapid real-time trajectory corrections, so that we will investigate this motor-compensation mechanism more fully.  4.

"MASS SPECTROMETRY IN ORGANIC AND BIOCHEMISTRY The application of various mass spectrometric techniques to structure elucidation of three classes of biologically important natural products will be studied.  The first group encompasses novel marine sterols, which differ primarily from terrestrial sterols in the nature of their unusual (elongated or branched) side chains.  This feature appears to be of importance in cell membrane function and a detailed knowledge of the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of such sterol types is needed for structural elucidation of novel and as yet unidentified sterols of marine organisms.  Much of this work requires synthesis of requisite sterol reference compounds or synthetic verification of postulated structure.  The second group of natural products deals with the unusual phospholipids isolated from marine organisms.  Much less is known about the mass spectrometric behavior of this biologically important class of natural products as compared to sterols, and we intend to explore this field in detail by comparing different ionization techniques (electron impact vs. field desorption vs. chemical ionization vs. fast atom bombardment) since each is likely to provide special structural information on specific portions of the phospholipid molecule.  Since the novel marine phospholipids are particularly unusual in the context of their unprecedented fatty acid components (usually polyunsaturated), work is also envisaged on the mass spectrometric location of such double bonds in long-chain fatty acids.  Finally, we intend to develop mass spectral procedures (notably through the use of chemical ionization mass spectrometry with hydrogen gas) in the porphyrin field with the aim of accomplishing an as yet largely unrealized goal, namely the location of chemical substituents in the four different pyrrole rings of the prophyrin molecule solely through the use of mass spectrometry.  If successful, this should not only make an important contribution to porphyrin chemistry, but should also help greatly in drug metabolism studies involving cytochrome P-450.

"MAXIMUM ENTROPY DENSITIES We propose to investigate the possibilities of a new paradigm for nonparametric probability density estimation (NPDE).  Recent advances in the fields of NPDE and maximum entropy support the above proposal.  It is expected that this new approach to NPDE will be able to unify several ad-hoc procedures currently used in NPDE.  This information - theoretic approach to density estimation is defined as a variational problem and uses the Kullback number as the fundamental measure of separation between probability densities.  The connections of NPDE with the general problem of smoothing of data, with the estimation of the failure rate in medical experiments and with the problem of pattern recognition in artificial intelligence make the pursuit of a unifying theory of NPDE very desirable.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs. Secondly, phantom studies will be applied to determine the imaging characteristics of the new techniques.  Thirdly, computer algorithms will be developed for quantitative analysis of the dynamic information recorded in the images.  Finally, preliminary clinical studies will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic imaging techniques.

"PRIMATE CHEMICAL COMMUNICATION INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES This research will provide new, fundamental information concerning chemical communication in a primate species.  The overall, long range objectives are to define the chemical nature and behavioral significance of the scent marks utilized by the South American tamarin, Saguinus fuscicollis, a member of the marmoset family (Callitrichidae), in social and sexual communication.  The scent marks of these primates encode messages on identify of species, subspecies, and individual as well as information relating to sexual and social status.  Scent mark material, a mixture of gland secretion, some urine and possibly genital discharge, is chemically complex and includes esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes and hydrocarbons.  To date our analytical studies using high resolution capillary gas chromatography have not revealed any qualitative differences in the scent marks of animals which differ in their sex, subspecies or species.  Therefore, we have embarked on a study to evaluate quantitative differences in the scent mark constituents.  Studies are proposed to identify the concentration profiles of the components which define gender, subspecies and species.  Analysis by computerized pattern recognition techniques will target those components which are correlated with gender, subspecies and species.  Sophisticated GC/MS/DS instrumentation will then be employed as the major tool for identification and quantitation of the targeted components.  Their role in chemical communication will be tested by behavioral assay.  Bacterial studies will also be undertaken to establish the role of microbial action in the production of some of the highly volatile components.  Finally, studies aimed at the identification of previously unknown components of lower volatility will be carried out.  We anticipate that this research will eventually lead to a deciphering of the chemical code such that in the end it will be possible to reconstruct with synthetic formulations the wide variety of communicatory signals employed by the tamarins.  To accomplish this goal a unique interdisciplinary research team consisting of two organic chemists, a primatologist and a bacteriologist has been assembled at the Monell Chemical Senses Center.  These studies follow logically from prior work of our laboratory.  To the best of our knowledge this research program, involving the very close collaboration of chemists, primatologists and bacteriologists to explore and define a chemical communication system in a primate species, is unique in the United States.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource promotes the development and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg and G. Sharp at the National Library of Medicine and University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have an active collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototyes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analyzer.

"SU MEDICAL EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER RESOURCE (SUMEX) Stanford University maintains a national shared computing resource in partnership with the NIH Biotechnology Resources Program to explore advanced applications of computer science in health research.  There are two main objectives of the facility:  1) the managerial, administrative and technical demonstration of a national shared technological resource for health research and 2) the specific encouragement of applications of artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM).  Besides the economic advantages of resource sharing made possible by emerging data communication technologies, a closer interaction between diverse research efforts is expected to promote a more systematic exchange of research products and ideas.  This may be particularly true in applications of computer science.  Multi-lateral community building rather than unilateral service is the project's essential mandate.  The term ""artificial intelligence"" (AI) is applied to research aimed at increasing the computer's effectiveness as a tool through the emulation of aspects of human symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.  The field emphasizes the judgmental manipulation of symbolic (non-numeric) representations of knowledge of a task domain for model-building and decision-making.  Current applications include programs which assist in inferring chemical structures from mass spectral or x-ray crystallographic data, suggesting diagnoses and treatments within various classes of diseases, and modeling aspects of human behavior patterns. Additional users of the facility will be selected within the available PDP-10 computer capacity with the help of an AIM Executive Committee and Advisory Group on the basis of reviews of the proposed research.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

The quantitative assay proposed for development will 1) allow for a measurement of the heterogeneity of concentration of receptors in cell populations, and 2) the proportion of cells in a tumor population that have estrogen receptor above a certain concentration level.  The recent development of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor makes the development of methods for immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptor feasible.  Additional recent advances in quantitative imaging cytology can be combined wih this to develop a fast, efficient and more accurate assay method and to eliminate the visual subjective components of the method.  This combination of these new techniques to produce a new quantitative assay is particularly important since it has already been shown that patients whose tumors contain estrogen receptors will have a higher probability of responding to hormonal therapy, and seem to have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors do not contain this receptor.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"CLINICAL DECISION SYSTEMS RESEARCH RESOURCE A new diagnostic procedure for CADUCEUS has been developed, which we believe provides a framework for solving all of the known problems encountered in our use of INTERNIST-1.  During the five year period covered by the current proposal, we intend to pursue the following specific aims:  Revision of the structure of the CADUCEUS knowledge base will be undertaken to support the enhanced capabilities of the new diagnostic procedure.  The revised knowledge base will be expanded to encompass all of the major diseases of internal medicine, and much of neurology.  Evaluation of the new CADUCEUS system will be undertaken in two phases. First, through protocol analytic studies, we intend to study and refine the human/machine interface of CADUCEUS, exploring specifically various modes of cooperative human/machine problem solving.  Subsequently, we plan to carry out formal evaluation studies of the system in order to gauge its diagnostic accuracy, the value of its information gathering and explanatory capability, and its acceptability to a variety of potential client groups.

"3-D COMPUTERIZED ATLAS OF HUMAN BRAIN The overall objective of this project is to develop techniques and ultimately a system which will allow the rapid, objective and quantitative analysis of brain scan data obtained from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). This entails relating the scans to a computer based atlas of the human brain for objective determination of anatomic information with which to relate the functional image.  We plan to develop a system with ""user friendly software"" (e.g. simple to use by clinicians and basic researchers).  We expect that the system will be highly interactive and will provide real-time analytic feedback abilities to the user.  Techniques will be developed for the interactive display, manipulation, and image processing of 3-D data.  A 3-D Voxel representation of a standard Atlas of the human brain as well as of clinical CT, MRI or PET data will be implemented.  Image processing capabilities will include automatic thresholding, reslicing in any arbitrary plane, calculation of various statistics, and highlighting outlines or areas of interest.  The display capabilities will include real-time translation, rotation, scaling, segmentation, and enhancement of 3-D medical objects.

"COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRY OF NEUROCHEMICALS Techniques of quantitative autoradiography have been employed to gain insights to chemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of brain function.  We will refine the method of quantitative autoradiography to allow more precise assessments of neurotransmitter receptors and drug binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS).  Particular attention will be directed to the problem of quenching of tritium emissions by white matter, and we will establish criteria for introducing quench corrections in studies involving human tissue.  We will extend studies on the quantitative autoradiography of monoamine uptake sites, utilizing the antidepressant compounds desmethylimipramine and imipramine to identify, respectively, uptake sites for norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Studies will be conducted to examine the ontogeny of monoamine uptake sites, possible sex differences, regulation of these sites and their distribution in post-mortem human brain.  Further studies will examine monoamine receptors, and compare the distribution of monoamine uptake sites and receptors.  The ontogeny of betal and beta2 adrenergic receptors will be examined, as will the cellular location of these selective subtypes, using the selective neurotoxin ibotenic acid.  The location of putative internalized beta adrenergic receptors will also be studied.  A major new emphasis of the present proposal will be studies of possible differences in neurotransmitter receptors in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with Huntington's disease, schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness. Extensive studies will be conducted of alterations in thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) and receptors for TRH in spinal tissue of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

"LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT This project has three aims.  The first is development, refinement, and testing of an explicit theory of language acquisition in children.  The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.  The proposed research will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile processing and visual and auditory processing, with developing measures relevant to understanding the neural coding of tactile patterns, and with improving cutaneous communication systems for the blind, deaf, and deaf-blind.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND CLINICAL DECISION MAKING This proposal is to develop an integrated program for the representation of complex knowledge and reasoning processes in medicine, using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI) and decision analysis (DA).  The project will address problems in both diagnostic and therapeutic reasoning in two medical domains: coronary disease, and fluid and electrolyte disturbances. The planned large-scale AI system will incorporate a common knowledge representation formalism and alternative reasoning programs to do data interpretation, hypothesis generation, hypothesis testing and revision, diagnostic query planning, therapeutic planning and automatically-generated explanations.  DA reasoning will be integrated into the system, especially to improve the test and treatment planning components.  A uniform knowledge base will be developed in the two identified medical domains, utilizing knowledge acquired from the analysis of protocols, expert opinion, case-based learning, hand-coded knowledge from the literature, and strictly limited attempts to automatically acquire structured knowledge from English free-text.  A panel of specific cases will be developed that can be used to validate additions to the knowledge base and changes in the reasoning components of the system.  A series of protocol analyses will be done, involving both diagnostic and therapeutic decision making in clinical settings where uncertainty and risk are predominant factors.  Specific attention will focus on the degree to which experienced clinicians rely on case-based reasoning and means will be developed to represent, index and utilize such case-based experience in the reasoning program.  A new generation of DA tools will be built to aid the construction of DA models for use in actual clinical settings.  These tools will utilize the same knowledge bases as the AI models, and will share with them the ability to look in varying depth of detail at problems and to generate explanations of their workings.  A set of template analyses dealing with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, renal transplantation, use of anticoagulant therapy and the timing of surgery for valvular heart disease, and a knowledge base of risk and prognosis estimates in these domains will also be constructed.  An AI based system for quantitative and qualitative reasoning about patient preferences will augment a system to help health professionals and patients to establish individual patient utility structures.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.  An investigation will also take place of the possibility of implementing the detection system in a microprocessor-based version for portability and ease of operation.

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.  This Phase I proposal is for the continued development of the TYCHO and KEPLER data base systems, specifically directed to cancer studies, in a private setting.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.  We will test the resulting system by the performance of specific rheumatologic studies using a 1,700 patient database provided to us by the American Rheumatism Association Medical Information System research group.
