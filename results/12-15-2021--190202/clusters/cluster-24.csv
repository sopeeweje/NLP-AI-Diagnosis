"TAPERED LINEAR ARRAY FOR ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA The overall goal of this project is to complete the development and to test a novel ultrasonic tapered linear phased array applicator for hyperthermia treatment.  Such an applicator will allow electronic steering of the focus along a desired path without the use of a mechanical scanning system and will remain fixed relative to the patient, making coupling easier.  The applicator will be computer controlled such that the scan path and/or intensity can be altered at any time during treatment to maintain a constatn uniform tumor temperature.  Such a system is expected to meet the requirements for controlled local hyperthermia treatment of deep-seated tumors.  Each element of the phased array applicator (64 in all) will be driven by a modular high-power multichannel RF generator similar to that used in the URI Therm-X, Inc. Sonotherm 1000 ultrasound hyperthermia system.  Initial testing of the applicator will consist of experimentally acquiring field plots and comparing them to the theoretically predicted plots.  Once satisfied that the experimental phased array applicator is generating fields as expected theoretically, and that these fields are such that they should be adequate for hyperthermia applications, tests on phantoms will be initiated.  Finally, the performance of the prototype applicator which electronically scans its focus will be compared to that of a mechanically scanned, fixed focus applicator for various scan patterns. If the proposed prototype ultrasonic phased array applicator exhibits heating performance and control commensurate with clinical needs, Phase II development will be devoted to the construction and animal testing of clinical prototype system in preparation for clinical trials.

"MICROWAVE PHASED ARRAY FOR HYPERTHERMIA CANCER THERAPY The goal of this project is to develop a prototype microwave phased array applicator for local tumor hyperthermia therapy.  The therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation therapy can be improved by the focused application of heat to the tumor.  The use of microwaves for the generation of local hyperthermia has been successfully applied in both animal and clinical studies.  However, current designs for microwave applicators heat only superficial tumors and must be mechanically moved in order to change the power distribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues.  The specific aims of the proposed Phase I study are designed to develop new techniques for producing local tumor hyperthermia using microwaves. Preliminary studies have resulted in a new design for a microwave phased array hyperthermia applicator.  The proposed Phase I studies will allow development of this existing design into a working prototype microwave hyperthermia applicator system.  This applicator system will consist of a microwave phased array applicator, a microwave power amplifier and distribution network, and a computer control system for the applicator. This new microwave phased array applicator system will have the capability of focusing microwave energy more effectively in tissue than presently available clinical devices and the location of the focus will be electronically rather than mechanically scanned in order to produce a uniform tumor temperature distribution without overheating surrounding normal tissues.  The results of the Phase I studies will provide a basis for human clinical trials of combined radiation and hyperthermia therapy.
