"GENETICS OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS AND LYMPHOCYTE MOLECULES 1. Lymphocyte differentiation antigens:  gene cloning, regulation and function  2. Immunoglobulin genetics, structure and function  3. B and T cell subset definitions, development, lineages and functions  4. Development of fluorescence activated cell sorting  Overall, we hope to understand the molecules and cells of the immune system:  how they develop, interact, are regulated, function, and result in immune disorders and malignancies when they malfunction.  Novel interspecific chimeric antibodies and site-specific mutated antibodies will be explored for reduced immunogenecity for use as therapeutic agents and for structure/function understanding.
