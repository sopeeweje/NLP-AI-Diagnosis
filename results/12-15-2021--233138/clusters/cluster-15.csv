"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.  We believe we can design a system of this type to sell for approximately $10,000.  This would bring powerful image processing technology within the reach of many more investigators.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"ARRAY PROCESSOR FOR MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING A powerful array processor to be attached to our existing VAX 11/780 computer is requested.  This instrument will be dedicated to research in medical imaging and image processing.  Specifically, four projects are proposed, two each in digital radiology and nuclear medicine.  In digital radiology, the goal of the proposed research is to deblur subtraction angiograms by using sophisticated image processing algorithms, thereby facilitating the visualization of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries.  Two distinct processing algorithms will be investigated.  Both of these algorithms are well known in the image processing leterature, but have not yet been applied to large medical images for lack of sufficient computer power.  The nuclear medicine projects have as their goal earlier detection and more accurate characterization of small neoplasms.  In one of these projects, three-dimensional images will be reconstructed from coded-aperture data.  This approach allows true tomographic reconstruction without any motion of the detector or aperture.  The other nuclear medicine project involves automated feature extraction and pattern recognition of liver scans.  In addition, it will include an attempt to optimize the design of nuclear imaging systems for most accurate extraction of the relevant features.

"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.  Using this combination of techniques it should be possible to detect any post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by rat hepatocytes in response to chronic injury.

"ATTENTIONAL DEFICIT CHILDREN:  A DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS This study will map certain dimensional aspects of personality (impulsivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking) and laboratory measures of nervous system sensitivity in 200 heterogeneous, clinically and school referred attention deficit disordered (ADD) subjects (structured interview diagnosis) and 50 controls.  Behavioral and physiological measures will be obtained during augmentation-reduction and signal detection procedures.  The primary goal is to construct a decision tree that will enhance the DSM-III diagnosis of ADD subjects in the sense of making it more predictive of clinical outcome at follow-up.  Past research of ours and others indicates that an augmentation-reduction procedure, in which the individual responds to tones of increasing intensity, differentiates hyperactive ADD children from controls and is predictive of therapeutic drug dose.  We will attempt to replicate and extend these results using signal detection techniques which would appear to be superior to augmenting procedures for purposes of studying nervous system sensitivity and attentional processes.  Russian investigators refer to sensitivity as strength.  This is assessed by them as a subject's ability to detect stimuli low in intensity and/or to withstand strong stimuli.  We extend this definition to include four hypothesized relatively independent dimensions:  sensitivity to tones low and high in intensity and sensitivity to reward and punishment.  These four laboratory measures will be correlated with dimensional aspects of personality, including impulsivity, aggressivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking.  Subjects will be grouped post hoc in several ways:  (a) on the basis of DSM-III diagnosis; (b) on the basis of DSM-III and personality attributes; (c) on the basis of DSM-III diagnoses and sensitivity indices; and (d) on the basis of DSM-III, personality, and sensitivity measures.  We hypothesize that (b), (c) and (d) will be more predictive of clinical outcome than (a).  We also expect (b) to correlate more closely with the laboratory measures of sensitivity than (a), but expect (b) and (c) to be independent predictors of outcome and to correlate about equally with outcome.  And we expect (d) to be the best predictor of outcome, particularly for children receiving methylphenidate.

"A CANCER RADIOTHERAPY EXPERT SYSTEM USING SIMULATION Radiation therapy for cancer is one of the first areas in which computers were widely used in support of clinical practice, dating back at least twenty years.  The initial application, still the major one today, was the calculation of radiation dose in the tumor region and in other locations of the patient's body.  However, knowledge about clinical implications of radiation treatment has been difficult to systematize in a form suitable for computer processing.  The number and range of treatment options is large.  Treatment optimization based on dose computations with variation of parameters can only handle a few of the possible options.  As an alternative approach to systematizing clinical knowledge of radiation effects, this project will develop an expert system for planning radiation therapy.  The problem of planning radiation therapy presents challenges in the design of expert systems.  Efficiency and flexibility are important because of the large problem space.  In addition, some of the knowledge of radiation treatment planning is most naturally expressed in the form of constraints, rather than production rules.  Most important, decision-making normally relies on a treatment simulation system to provide dose and geometric information about proposed treatment strategies.  To meet these requirements this project will develop and investigate the properties of an expert system that integrates with a treatmet simulation system.  The two systems will be coupled using a message passing technique previously developed for the simulation system internal operation.  The expert system will use both frames and production rules as appropriate tothe problem domain.  Constraint mechanisms will be introduced which allow constraints to be strengthened or weakened as the system preceeds toward a solution.  The simulation system will be coupled to the expert system as a means of checking constraint satisfaction and graphically displaying the solution(s).  The integration of a simulation system with appropriate knowledge representation techniques should provide new insight into methods of constraint satisfaction, and also extend understanding of the design and behavior of hybrid systems.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.

"STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF INTERPHASE CHROMOSOMES The newly developed instrumentation and software now allows three-dimensional reconstruction, in a generalized fashion, of subcellular structures, at both the light and high voltage electron microscopic levels.  Eighteen nuclei have been reconstructed and interpreted in a quantitative fashion.  Six nuclei have their cytogenetic loci aligned with the three-dimensional structures showing that many chromosome features are three-dimensionally determined.  It is proposed to determine, three-dimensionally, many adjacent polytene nuclei in defined developmental stages and tissues so that it will be possible to see in a quantitative fashion the structural relationships. Many computational approaches are proposed to process the images, to refine the structures, to position the bands, hence genes three-dimensionally, and to determine the fine structure of nuclei.  These studies will also utilize monoclonal antibodies to localize active gene loci and their close associations one with another and the nuclear envelope, and to relate structure to function.  Diploid nuclei will, in addition, be three-dimensionally reconstructed at highest possible light microscope resolution in intact Drosophila embryos. Questions related to differences in the 3D patterns of the interphase chromosomes as a function of development, and the cell cycle will be studied.  The laboratory will continue to reconstruct mitotic chromosomes and interband/bands from polytene chromosomes from Drosophila in a resolution-overlaping fashion made possible by the three-dimensional light microscopy and much higher resolution of the high voltage electron microscope utilizing systematic high tilt about 70 degrees for three-dimensional structure.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.

"EIDETIC--A CONSULTANT SYSTEM FOR IMAGE-BASED DIAGNOSIS Within the realm of medical decision making, pathological diagnosis is noteworthy in that practitioners depend to a large extent on visual experience in the interpretation of histologial and cytological preparations.  Since standard computer-based decision systems support only textual interactions, they are inadequate for image-intensive diagnosis. For this reason we are proposing a different sort of consultant system with the ability to manipulate both text and images.  The name of the system is EIDETIC.  Its design is novel in that the textual decision system, akin to a conventional expert system, has the ability to retrieve and display digitized micrographs from a large image data base.  The images called by the program are intended to provide an appropriate, annotated and complete visual experience for the pathologist at the point of decision.  The goal of the project is to develop a device which can measurably improve the quality of diagnosis in the domain of neuropathology.  In addition to compressing visual experience around the point of decision, other new diagnostic techniques will be engendered.  Facilities will be provided which incorporate image processing into the diagnostic routine, and which delineate appropriate use of immuno- and cytochemical stains.  Means are being developed to digitize microscopic images, create overlays, and store images with associated textual descriptors.  The consultant system will define the current diagnostic context and call appropriate images by searching these textual descriptors.  EIDETIC is designed to segregate domain specific from domain independent components.  This has been done to facilitate the extension of these methodologies to other image-intensive disciplines.  These might include areas of radiology, ophthalmology, endoscopy, and dermatology.  The system is intended as a first generation tool to explore the manner in which visual interpretation and diagnosis can be assisted by newly evolved digital technologies.

"LOW COST OCR READER FOR THE VISUALLY IMPAIRED The objective of this research is to design and prototype a low-cost optical character recognizer (OCR) with voice output for aiding visually-impaired persons to read books, magazines, and other printed materials.  A primary objective is to design an easy-to-use device for a $1,000-$2,000 retail price.  Ways of reducing costs are design of a hand-operated machine, relaxing speed and accuracy requirements, and design with low-cost parts.  The principal methodology used will be developing the OCR algorithm with an OCR development workstation.  The workstation features rapid prototyping of segmenting and recognition strategies, and a graphical user interface.  The workstation has some of the features of the Small Talk artificial intelligence development system, and it is expected to speed up development and testing of OCR algorithms by a factor of four.  A potential commercial application is to allow the visually impaired to be more productive.  Additional commercial applications are graphics scanning and OCR input.  The wider commercial applications are expected to provide incentives to lower the price to visually-impaired individuals.  To this end, the proposer has located sources of private funds.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.  Moreover, should clinically useful markers be developed, this would point the way towards the use of these same methods in other tumor systems.

"EXPERT CAUSAL MODELS IN THE MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE The goal of this research is to design and build a computer program which can understand a realistic case description, construct a detailed model of the internal state of the patient and its evolution, and answer questions about the pathophysiology of the particular case.  This research addresses a need for medical reasoning programs that can demonstrate a deep understanding of the state of the patient, rather than simply producing the name of a disease.  Our current research has produced a representation for causal relationships in physiological mechanisms that includes a qualitative language for describing the structure of a mechanism and a method for envisioning the possible behaviors of that mechanism.  We propose to use this knowledge representation as the basis for a program to reason about a limited, but natural and complex medical domain:  disorders of sodium and water balance.  The domain of sodium and water balance is well-understood scientifically, but poses complex clinical problems that will be a realistic test for the representation.  The program will assimilate information about a patient in the format of a natural case description, and will determine the diagnosis and formulate a detailed description of the patient's internal state.  We will evaluate the program's behavior according to its ability to answer the types of questions that might be asked of a resident during clinical training.  Our research method rests heavily on the detailed observation of human experts, both to capture the knowledge used and to determine the representation for that knowledge.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.

"AUTOMATED CANCER CELL DIAGNOSIS BY THE TICAS METHOD The goal of this research is to study high-resolution image analysis of cervical cells for diagnostic assessment of patients.  The discovery of the marker features for the presence of dysplasia or malignant disease expressed in ""normal appearing"" intermediate cells from the ectocervix has affected the very strategy of prescreening for cervical cancer.  If confirmed on a large database of patients, the finding of frank tumor cells could be replaced by the statistical assessment of a limited sample of a patient's intermediate cells to ascertain whether visual review of the patient's sample is required.  Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.  The great explosion in the accumulation of structural data bears witness that investigators, over 4,000 of them, think that the information is important in their many different fields including virology, immunology, pharmacology, oncology, genetics, genetic engineering, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology.  Protein structures contain important information required for understanding the causes of disease and developing a rational approach to treatment.  These data are essential in the design of cures based on information macromolecules, which can be specific to the individual or to the particular type of virus, cancer, autoimmune disease, on inborn error of metabolism.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL SYNTHESIS The major objective of this work is the application of digital computers to the derivation of synthetic pathways to complex organic structures.  A general problem-solving program, LHASA II (Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis), is being developed which can be used interactively by a chemist with simple graphical input-output of structural formulas.  The principles and strategies of organic synthesis are being formalized for use by the program.  In addition, the vast range of information on synthetic chemistry is being organized and rationalized to provide a rich and effective data base.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"MECHANISM OF PROTEIN LOCALIZATION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI The mechanisms of protein localization are of central biological importance at all levels, from the functioning of individual molecules to the biogenesis of higher ordered structures, including the cell itself. Although secreted proteins have a general requirement for some type of cellular export mechinery, the details of such secretion systems are not known.  The overall objective of this work is to use E. coli as a model system to determine the composition, function, and number of such cellular secretion systems.  Initial work is aimed at using a combination of genetics and biochemistry to define one secretion system, the secA system. Genetic approaches will be used to define the genes which code for the components of this system and to obtain mutants in these genes.  The secreted proteins which use this system will be identified using currently available mutants (SecA-) in the export system.  The site on the polypeptide chain of the secreted protein which targets it to use this expert system will be determined using gene fusion technology to create specific hybrid proteins of interest.  This latter study is aimed at understanding the specific interactions of secreted proteins with individual components of the export machinery.  This should allow a structure-function analysis for this secretion system.

"TWO DIMENSIONAL PHOTON COUNTING POSTITION ENCODER A two-dimensional Photon Counting Position Encoder is proposed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) medical cameras.  The new detector uses three new concepts:  1) a method of controlling the spatial distribution of photons from Bismuth Germanate Scintillators, 2) the use of all digital photon counting for processing the photomultiplier signal, and 3) the use of pattern recognition to encode position.  The new detector is expected to reduce the cost of this portion of the PET scanner by approximately a factor of eight.  The cost reduction anticipated for a typical four ring camera will be in the range of $600,000 to $1,000,000 which is 20-40 percent of the cost of the PET scanner.  In addition to the potential cost savings of this new approach, the photon division technique will allow one to obtain 2-3 mm position resolution in two dimensions.

"STUDIES OF THE DISSEMINATION OF CONSULTATION SYSTEMS We propose to undertake resource-related research into the develo]ment of methodologies that will permit dissemination of high performance clinical consultation and data management systems.  We have developed a prototype system which provides a framework for the execution of clinical trials. Our goal is to extend this model to a broader range of investigators, including those in both academic and community settings.  The initial system, named ONCOCIN, was developed on the SUMEX-AIM Resource at Stanford University and is designed to help oncologists manage patients enrolled in experimental cancer chemotherapy protocols.  In its initial three years, the research has focused on theoretical computer science issues regarding the representation of medical knowledge and the development of optimal methods for encouraging the use of computer-based tools by physicians.  The prototype system has been introduced for limited use in our oncology clinic.  Our goal is to allow systems like ONCOCIN to function independently, on their own hardware, so that they can become useful tools for clinical investigators in a variety of research settings.  We propose a five-year effort with the following specific aims:  (1) to transfer the oncology prototype from its current research computer to a powerful professional workstation that provides a model for the technology that will soon allow large scale cost-effective dissemination of clinical consultation systems; (2) to encode and implement for use by ONCOCIN the commonly used chemotherapy protocols from our oncology clinic; (3) to introduce ONCOCIN gradually for ongoing use so that two professional workstations become available in the oncology clinic to assist in the management of patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials; (4) to implement ONCOCIN beyond the Stanford environment to demonstrate the transferability of the technology and its potential for involving community physicians in clinical investigation; and (5) to develop and test methods for assessing the impact of this kind of tool on physicians, and on their modes of practice.

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"AUTOMATED EXPERT INTERPRETATION OF STATISTICAL RESEARCH The aim of the proposed project is to investigate the feasibility of developing a microcomputer-based expert system to assist scientists in selecting, performing, interpreting, and reporting statistical procedures. Often researchers in the health sciences are highly competent in their specific areas of expertise but inadequately trained in choosing and interpreting the statistics that are appropriate for the research they would like to do.  Also, many competent researchers are so pressed for time that they fail to prepare detailed reports of their research for the larger scientific community.  In Phase One, the feasibility of a computerized expert system will be demonstrated by developing and evaluating the automated design-consultation component of the system and by developing the report-generation facility for one complex statistical interpretation problem.  In Phase Two, the design and implementation of the complete computerized expert statistical system will be accomplished.  It appears that there is a great commercial opportunity for a microcomputer-based expert system to assist scientist in selecting, performing, interpreting, and reporting statistical procedures.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource will promote the developement and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed research.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg & G. Sharp at the University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have a major collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototypes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system on a chip, incorporated in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analysizer.  We have also succeeded in transferring the large rheumotology consultation knowledge base onto a M68000 microprocessor machine, which will be accessible and affordable to smaller investigative groups and clinicians.  We are proposing to continue these innovations through experimentation with different kinds of microprocessor systems, introducing better graphics and other user-friendly interfaces.  These systems will be tested and evaluated by our biomedical collaborators.  In addition to the research in the Resource, we intend to continue the highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series, and the Rutgers participation in national AIM collaborative research.

Improvements are anticipated in range, and clarity of images, especially of chest cavity images, which require the greatest range of clarity.  In addition, greater flexibility and lower noise levels will be achieved through signal conditioning at the transducer site.  these improvements will be made by concerted work in four areas: 1.  Evaluation of new transducer materials and composites.  Literature of piezoelectic materials and devices will be constantly reviewed, and, when results appear to have use in medical imaging transducers, laboratory tests of the materials will be conducted.  2.  Impedance and energy matching of transducers to aqueous media.  Techniques to be investigated include geometric matching, multiple thin layer matching, and cooperative electical matching.  3.  Novel transducer geometries and excitation methods.  Novel transducer geometries include well matched linear and arc sector arrays, radial surface wave devices, and surface wave scanning arrays.  4.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.

"SUPPORT FOR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS COMPUTER The Physiology Computer Research Resource collaborates with biomedical research laboratories at several medical schools supporting laboratory automation.  Collaborating laboratories are investigating:  synaptic input to brainstem respiratory neurons, cutaneous sensory dorsal horn neurons, neural genesis of respiratory rhythm, time-resolved single cell laser spectroscopy, muscle contraction, membrane biophysics, cellular aspects of cardiac defibrillation, neurophysiology, quantitative video intensification microscopy, cardiovascular control and microvasculature.  Collaboration is fostered through the Federated Processor Laboratory Automation System (FPLAS) consisting of hardware and software modules designed, developed, and produced by the Resource.  The ""federated"" nature of this system -- several processing units of equal complexity but differing in their areas of specialization -- is derived from recent insights in parallel computation and bus architecture.  The FPLAS accommodates the demands of the biomedical research instrumentation environment and allows incremental increase in system performance through incorporation of expected semiconductor technology advances.  The modular construction of the system allows these anticipated advances to be incorporated in an incremental fashion while retaining the majority of the existing equipment.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.  The remaining three years of the career development award would be dedicated to the continued exploration of simulation models of cognitive and perceptual processes constructed in the light of what I would learn during the first two years; and to the writing of a book designed to help establish the approach of developing neurally plausible simulation models as a central part of the study of perceptual and cognitive processes.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A HEPARIN MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Heparin is a direct acting anticoagulant that has been used for the treatment of thromboembolic conditions for over 30 years.  The major problems with therapy include overanticoagulation leading to bleeding episodes, and underanticoagulation resulting in thrombus formation.  The incidence of these problems in hospitalized patients ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Rick factors for bleeding include age, dose, alcohol use, sex and renal function.  Individualization of heparin therapy is currently based on empirical judgment.  No method employing current computer technologies and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling techniques has been developed to assist in anticoagulating patients receiving heparin.  Biotrack is developing products to assist in the management of patients with thromboembolic diseases. The first of these, Warfcalc, has already been developed and tested in patients treated with the oral anticoagulant, Warfarin.  The purpose of this project is to extend Biotrack's expertise in developing expert systems for anticoagulation to heparin.  This would involve developing a large population base for heparin which would define the best model for describing heparin's dynamics and kinetics.  Biotrack proposes in Phase I to develop the population base for heparin and to develop a prototype expert system for predicting heparin response.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"KINEMATIC AND CELLULAR STUDIES OF MOTOR CONTROL The main goal is to understand how the central nervous system coordinates the large number of degrees of freedom of the arm.  The experimental approach includes recording and analysis of the kinematics of multijoint movements.  In some cases, a simple mechanical system is used to record the movements.  When full arm freedom is required, an optoelectric recording system is used.  Work will continue on the following projects on multijoint control.  1. Multijoint movements of the right and left arms are being compared.  The comparison includes movements to visual targets, movements which are unexpectedly perturbed, and isometric force production.  2. Studies of the multijoint movements of patients with movement disorders will be continued.  To date, there has been concentration on patients with cerebellar disease and Parkinson's disease.  Simple movements to visual targets have been emphasized.  In the next year, unexpectedly perturbed movements and isometric force production will be studied in these same patient groups, in order to more fully characterize the physiology of these disorders.  3. We are studying the control of multijoint movements in the presence of unexpected mechanical loads.  We recently found that with same load types subjects make movements with the same kinematic characteristics as in the unloaded condition.  This suggests that there may be a mechanism for rapid real-time trajectory corrections, so that we will investigate this motor-compensation mechanism more fully.  4. The multijoint arm stiffness of patients with a variety of central lesions will be compared to that of normal individuals.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.

"SUPPORT FOR PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOPHYSICS COMPUTER The Physiology Computer Research Resource collaborates with biomedical research laboratories at several medical schools supporting laboratory automation.  Collaborating laboratories are investigating:  synaptic input to brainstem respiratory neurons, cutaneous sensory dorsal horn neurons, neural genesis of respiratory rhythm, time-resolved single cell laser spectroscopy, muscle contraction, membrane biophysics, cellular aspects of cardiac defibrillation, neurophysiology, quantitative video intensification microscopy, cardiovascular control and microvasculature.  Collaboration is fostered through the Federated Processor Laboratory Automation System (FPLAS) consisting of hardware and software modules designed, developed, and produced by the Resource.  The ""federated"" nature of this system -- several processing units of equal complexity but differing in their areas of specialization -- is derived from recent insights in parallel computation and bus architecture.  The FPLAS accommodates the demands of the biomedical research instrumentation environment and allows incremental increase in system performance through incorporation of expected semiconductor technology advances.  The modular construction of the system allows these anticipated advances to be incorporated in an incremental fashion while retaining the majority of the existing equipment.  Incremental growth allowed by the FP architecture is particularly important to the biomedical research community because its applications do not constitute a broad enough market to bear the ever escalating development costs which accompany development of new semiconductor devices.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs. Secondly, phantom studies will be applied to determine the imaging characteristics of the new techniques.  Thirdly, computer algorithms will be developed for quantitative analysis of the dynamic information recorded in the images.  Finally, preliminary clinical studies will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic imaging techniques.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource promotes the development and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg and G. Sharp at the National Library of Medicine and University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have an active collaboration with Dr. C. Dawson at the University of California-San Francisco.  An important aspect of our research is technology transfer, producing prototyes that will be useful to clinical researchers and practitioners.  We have pioneered developments in this field by putting an expert system in a widely used clinical instrument:  a serum protein electrophoresis analyzer.  We are proposing to continue these micro-based innovations for two applications: the interpretation of CPK/LDH isoenzymes for the diagnosis of heart attacks and a primary eye care program for developing countries.  We also propose to continue our research in rule refinement and empirical analysis of expert system knowledge bases.  In addition to the research activities of the Resource, we continue that highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series and the Rutgers Resource participation in national AIM collaborative research.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.  The great explosion in the accumulation of structural data bears witness that investigators, over 4,000 of them, think that the information is important in their many different fields including virology, immunology, pharmacology, oncology, genetics, genetic engineering, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology.  Protein structures contain important information required for understanding the causes of disease and developing a rational approach to treatment.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"A CANCER RADIOTHERAPY EXPERT SYSTEM USING SIMULATION Radiation therapy for cancer is one of the first areas in which computers were widely used in support of clinical practice, dating back at least twenty years.  The initial application, still the major one today, was the calculation of radiation dose in the tumor region and in other locations of the patient's body.  However, knowledge about clinical implications of radiation treatment has been difficult to systematize in a form suitable for computer processing.  The number and range of treatment options is large.  Treatment optimization based on dose computations with variation of parameters can only handle a few of the possible options.  As an alternative approach to systematizing clinical knowledge of radiation effects, this project will develop an expert system for planning radiation therapy.  The problem of planning radiation therapy presents challenges in the design of expert systems.  Efficiency and flexibility are important because of the large problem space.  In addition, some of the knowledge of radiation treatment planning is most naturally expressed in the form of constraints, rather than production rules.  Most important, decision-making normally relies on a treatment simulation system to provide dose and geometric information about proposed treatment strategies.  To meet these requirements this project will develop and investigate the properties of an expert system that integrates with a treatmet simulation system.  The two systems will be coupled using a message passing technique previously developed for the simulation system internal operation.  The expert system will use both frames and production rules as appropriate tothe problem domain.  Constraint mechanisms will be introduced which allow constraints to be strengthened or weakened as the system preceeds toward a solution.  The simulation system will be coupled to the expert system as a means of checking constraint satisfaction and graphically displaying the solution(s).  The integration of a simulation system with appropriate knowledge representation techniques should provide new insight into methods of constraint satisfaction, and also extend understanding of the design and behavior of hybrid systems.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3. Select and test several methods of formulating and providing warnings to physicians in order to implement a feedback method that is acceptable and useful. 4. Design and begin implementation of an evaluation of the prototype MENTOR system with respect to its impact on the physicians therapeutic decision making as well as its effects on the patient in terms of specific mortality and morbidity measures.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

"FETAL LUNG BIOCHEMISTRY AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MICROANATOMY During late fetal development, the lung must prepare for the transition to air breathing.  Maintaining alveolar stability becomes vital for survival. Therapy with glucocorticoids to enhance lung maturity may have immediate and long term consequences for lung structure and function.  This series of investigations is directed toward furthering our basic knowledge of lung secretory cell development.  We will use structural and biochemical methods to test hypotheses of secretory cell function and to test the probabilities that glucocorticoids damage fetal and newborn lung structure.  We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.

"QUANTITATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION IN CELLS The objective of this project is to develop quantitative estrogen receptor concentration measurements using high resolution digital image microscopy techniques.  These techniques will enable direct mesurements of receptor concentration on a cell by cell basis.  This is an improvement over the current biochemical assays which only give an average value for receptor concentration.  The quantitative assay proposed for development will 1) allow for a measurement of the heterogeneity of concentration of receptors in cell populations, and 2) the proportion of cells in a tumor population that have estrogen receptor above a certain concentration level.  The recent development of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor makes the development of methods for immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptor feasible.  Additional recent advances in quantitative imaging cytology can be combined wih this to develop a fast, efficient and more accurate assay method and to eliminate the visual subjective components of the method.  This combination of these new techniques to produce a new quantitative assay is particularly important since it has already been shown that patients whose tumors contain estrogen receptors will have a higher probability of responding to hormonal therapy, and seem to have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors do not contain this receptor.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRY OF NEUROCHEMICALS Techniques of quantitative autoradiography have been employed to gain insights to chemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of brain function.  We will refine the method of quantitative autoradiography to allow more precise assessments of neurotransmitter receptors and drug binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS).  Particular attention will be directed to the problem of quenching of tritium emissions by white matter, and we will establish criteria for introducing quench corrections in studies involving human tissue.  We will extend studies on the quantitative autoradiography of monoamine uptake sites, utilizing the antidepressant compounds desmethylimipramine and imipramine to identify, respectively, uptake sites for norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Studies will be conducted to examine the ontogeny of monoamine uptake sites, possible sex differences, regulation of these sites and their distribution in post-mortem human brain.  Further studies will examine monoamine receptors, and compare the distribution of monoamine uptake sites and receptors.  The ontogeny of betal and beta2 adrenergic receptors will be examined, as will the cellular location of these selective subtypes, using the selective neurotoxin ibotenic acid.  The location of putative internalized beta adrenergic receptors will also be studied.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF INTERPHASE CHROMOSOMES The newly developed instrumentation and software now allows three-dimensional reconstruction, in a generalized fashion, of subcellular structures, at both the light and high voltage electron microscopic levels.  Eighteen nuclei have been reconstructed and interpreted in a quantitative fashion.  Six nuclei have their cytogenetic loci aligned with the three-dimensional structures showing that many chromosome features are three-dimensionally determined.  It is proposed to determine, three-dimensionally, many adjacent polytene nuclei in defined developmental stages and tissues so that it will be possible to see in a quantitative fashion the structural relationships. Many computational approaches are proposed to process the images, to refine the structures, to position the bands, hence genes three-dimensionally, and to determine the fine structure of nuclei.  These studies will also utilize monoclonal antibodies to localize active gene loci and their close associations one with another and the nuclear envelope, and to relate structure to function.  Diploid nuclei will, in addition, be three-dimensionally reconstructed at highest possible light microscope resolution in intact Drosophila embryos. Questions related to differences in the 3D patterns of the interphase chromosomes as a function of development, and the cell cycle will be studied.  The laboratory will continue to reconstruct mitotic chromosomes and interband/bands from polytene chromosomes from Drosophila in a resolution-overlaping fashion made possible by the three-dimensional light microscopy and much higher resolution of the high voltage electron microscope utilizing systematic high tilt about 70 degrees for three-dimensional structure.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

"ATTENTIONAL DEFICIT CHILDREN:  A DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS This study will map certain dimensional aspects of personality (impulsivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking) and laboratory measures of nervous system sensitivity in 200 heterogeneous, clinically and school referred attention deficit disordered (ADD) subjects (structured interview diagnosis) and 50 controls.  Behavioral and physiological measures will be obtained during augmentation-reduction and signal detection procedures.  The primary goal is to construct a decision tree that will enhance the DSM-III diagnosis of ADD subjects in the sense of making it more predictive of clinical outcome at follow-up.  Past research of ours and others indicates that an augmentation-reduction procedure, in which the individual responds to tones of increasing intensity, differentiates hyperactive ADD children from controls and is predictive of therapeutic drug dose.  We will attempt to replicate and extend these results using signal detection techniques which would appear to be superior to augmenting procedures for purposes of studying nervous system sensitivity and attentional processes.  Russian investigators refer to sensitivity as strength.  This is assessed by them as a subject's ability to detect stimuli low in intensity and/or to withstand strong stimuli.  We extend this definition to include four hypothesized relatively independent dimensions:  sensitivity to tones low and high in intensity and sensitivity to reward and punishment.  These four laboratory measures will be correlated with dimensional aspects of personality, including impulsivity, aggressivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking.  Subjects will be grouped post hoc in several ways:  (a) on the basis of DSM-III diagnosis; (b) on the basis of DSM-III and personality attributes; (c) on the basis of DSM-III diagnoses and sensitivity indices; and (d) on the basis of DSM-III, personality, and sensitivity measures.  We hypothesize that (b), (c) and (d) will be more predictive of clinical outcome than (a).  We also expect (b) to correlate more closely with the laboratory measures of sensitivity than (a), but expect (b) and (c) to be independent predictors of outcome and to correlate about equally with outcome.

"MECHANISM OF PROTEIN LOCALIZATION IN ESCHERICHIA COLI The mechanisms of protein localization are of central biological importance at all levels, from the functioning of individual molecules to the biogenesis of higher ordered structures, including the cell itself. Although secreted proteins have a general requirement for some type of cellular export mechinery, the details of such secretion systems are not known.  The overall objective of this work is to use E. coli as a model system to determine the composition, function, and number of such cellular secretion systems.  Initial work is aimed at using a combination of genetics and biochemistry to define one secretion system, the secA system. Genetic approaches will be used to define the genes which code for the components of this system and to obtain mutants in these genes.  The secreted proteins which use this system will be identified using currently available mutants (SecA-) in the export system.  The site on the polypeptide chain of the secreted protein which targets it to use this expert system will be determined using gene fusion technology to create specific hybrid proteins of interest.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.

"TAPERED LINEAR ARRAY FOR ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA The overall goal of this project is to complete the development and to test a novel ultrasonic tapered linear phased array applicator for hyperthermia treatment.  Such an applicator will allow electronic steering of the focus along a desired path without the use of a mechanical scanning system and will remain fixed relative to the patient, making coupling easier.  The applicator will be computer controlled such that the scan path and/or intensity can be altered at any time during treatment to maintain a constatn uniform tumor temperature.  Such a system is expected to meet the requirements for controlled local hyperthermia treatment of deep-seated tumors.  Each element of the phased array applicator (64 in all) will be driven by a modular high-power multichannel RF generator similar to that used in the URI Therm-X, Inc. Sonotherm 1000 ultrasound hyperthermia system.  Initial testing of the applicator will consist of experimentally acquiring field plots and comparing them to the theoretically predicted plots.  Once satisfied that the experimental phased array applicator is generating fields as expected theoretically, and that these fields are such that they should be adequate for hyperthermia applications, tests on phantoms will be initiated.  Finally, the performance of the prototype applicator which electronically scans its focus will be compared to that of a mechanically scanned, fixed focus applicator for various scan patterns. If the proposed prototype ultrasonic phased array applicator exhibits heating performance and control commensurate with clinical needs, Phase II development will be devoted to the construction and animal testing of clinical prototype system in preparation for clinical trials.

"PROTEIN MARKERS OF RENAL CELL CARCINOMA The molecular events associated with the development of renal cell carcinoma are essentially unknown and useful biochemical markers for this tumor are not available.  High-resolution protein separation techniques have been used in preliminary experiments to identify a group of proteins which are associated with the tumor, but absent or significantly reduced in normal renal cortex.  This application has as its long-term objective the understanding of the role these proteins play in the expression of the malignant phenotype and the determination of whether serum, urine, or tissue assays for these proteins are of clinical relevance.  The first specific aim of this proposal concerns the production of monoclonal antibodies to these proteins through the immunization of mice with protein spots cut from two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, a recently developed technique.  The second aim deals with the use of these antibodies to help isolate and characterize the proteins as to molecular weight, subunit composition, glycosylation, cellular localization, and tissue specificity. These studies will use two-dimensional electrophoresis, affinity chromatography, and immunohistochemical staining.  The third specific aim deals with the evaluation of three established renal cell carcinoma-derived cell lines as model systems.  Quantitative computer-aided pattern analysis will be used to compare two-dimensional gels of the cultured cells and tumor tissue, and immunologic methods will also be used to confirm the presence or absence of the carcinoma-associated proteins in the cultured cells.  Specific aim four will be to determine by immunoassay if any of the carcinoma-associated proteins or circulating antibodies to these proteins are present in the serum of patients with this tumor.  If so, preliminary studies will be initiated to determine the potential clinical usefulness for the detection, staging, or typing of renal tumors.  The studies outlined here should provide fundamental information about the biochemistry, cell biology, and clinical chemistry of a group of proteins associated with renal cell carcinoma and provide the necessary tools and information to pursue one or several of these proteins in greater detail in the future.  Moreover, should clinically useful markers be developed, this would point the way towards the use of these same methods in other tumor systems.

"DERIVING KNOWLEDGE FROM CLINICAL DATABASES The major concern of the RX Project is with the development of tools for the collection, analysis, and interpretation of health care data. Specifically, the objectives of the project are 1) to increase the validity and ease of data analysis and interpretation and 2) to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation and preliminary confirmation.  The principal focus of our research will continue to be on the RX Study Module.  Utilizing an on-line knowledge base of clinical medicine and of statistical procedures, the Study Module is designed to assist a researcher with the task of creating a comprehensive, mathematically correct study design using appropriate data from a large clinical database.  The Study Module determines an overall study design choosing between cross-sectional and longitudinal methods, it determines significant confounding variables and methods for controlling them, it determines patient eligibility criteria, and it formulates a mathematical model for testing the hypothesis.  Finally, the Study Module automatically runs the study design on a statistical package and assists with the interpretation of results.  A second focus of our work is in methods for aiding hypothesis generation. We seek to facilitate this process by developing improved means for labeling and accessing patient records.  We are also interested in developing methods for automating the dicovery of hypotheses by using methods from the field of artificial intelligence.  Our method will use a medical knowledge base to focus the search for promising hypotheses.  Our planned research for all these endeavors will build on our present algorithms and the current RX prototype.

"EVALUATING OUTCOMES FOLLOWING PROSTATECTOMY Prostatectomy for benign hypertrophy of the prostate is the major operation most commonly performed on male members of the Medicare Program. Prostatectomy lacks a firm base of scientific evidence regarding indications for use and outcomes.  The objective is to show how non-experimental studies can produce useful information on the efficacy and effectiveness of prostatectomy and be used to provide the requisite information for designing a controlled clinical trial.  Members of the research team have been engaged in evaluating the outcome of this operation in Maine using several strategies, including a literature review, cohort studies of mortality and complication rates using claims data, interview studies of patients for functional status assessment before and after surgery and interview studies of these patients' physicians to ascertain the reasons (clinical hypotheses) for undertaking the operation.  The information from the patient interview studies will be further analyzed to develop indices of patient morbidity, symptoms, functional impairment and utilities and integrated, along with the results from the claims-based cohort study of mortality and complications into a decision analysis to evaluate the probabilities and utilities for the surgery and the natural history ""arms"" of the decision tree.  The results of these various studies will be used to evaluate the need for a randomized clinical trial:  which clinical hypotheses are urgently in need of experimental evaluation and what is the design of the experiment to test these hypotheses?

"SYMPTOM EVOLUTION IN APHASIA: A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY Two related projects are proposed as part of an application for a Research Career Development Award.  First, it is suggested that information about the evolution of patients' symptoms during recovery from aphasia will provide an important source of constraint on the postulation of explanatory models to account for particular aphasis syndromes.  Three separate experimental batteries are developed to investigate the nature of the underlying deficit in agrammatic Broca's aphasia, conduction aphasia and anomic aphasia.  Specific hypotheses are developed concerning the possible relationships among co-occuring symptoms and their underlying basis. Patients meeting the selection criteria will be tested at several intervals over the course of the first year post-onset using one of the experimental batteries.  A second project is proposed to develop a computer-based system for the simulation and classification of reading and writing errors produced by dyslexic and dysgraphic patients.  This system will focus on the classification of errors involving the translation between graphemes and phonemes, and is intended to investigate the incidence of errors that are related to grapheme-to-phoneme or phoneme-to-grapheme conversion.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.  The remaining three years of the career development award would be dedicated to the continued exploration of simulation models of cognitive and perceptual processes constructed in the light of what I would learn during the first two years; and to the writing of a book designed to help establish the approach of developing neurally plausible simulation models as a central part of the study of perceptual and cognitive processes.

"COMPUTER-BASED RESPIRATORY SUPPORT CONSULTANT The aggressive respiratory management protocols used in testing infants suffering from acute hyaline membrane disease (HMD) involves maintaining a delicate balance between meeting the infant's respiratory needs and avoiding the devastating long-term consequences of excessive airway pressures and oxygen.  Systematic use of all the knowledge affecting ventilator therapy decisions will improve the quality of care, particularly during periods when the most experienced clinicians are not present.  The objective of this project is to design and implement a computer-based system which will aid clinicians in providing appropriate respiratory support for infants suffering acute HMD.  The system will build on our previously developed computer-based HMD course and management model. Knowledge of treatment protocols and the therapeutic and diagnostic states under which each protocol operates will be derived from our current clinical practices.  This knowledge will be expressed as treatment and diagnostic rules and incorporated in a small knowledge-based system written in Turbo Prolog and implemented on a personal computer.  Such an approach allows flexible use of qualitative physiological and clinical knowledge to an extent which is difficult to achieve with traditional programming methods.  The resulting system can be modified and expanded to extend the domain of applicability to a broader population and improve the system's predictive accuracy.  This system will use readily available data (e.g. blood gases, respirator settings, physical signs) in conjunction with diagnostic rules to maintain a list of attributes reflecting an individual baby's current physiological and treatment status.  The system will search the treatment rules for all applicable therapy changes which could correct a given blood gas abnormality, and list the alternatives along with their side effects and the applicable rationale.  It will be a valuable tool in teaching the principles of ventilator management.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM The Committee on Models for Biomedical Research has proposed a ""matrix of biological knowledge"" (Matrix) to address the need for a means to organize and intelligently access the wealth of information that confronts biomedical researchers (c.f. Models for Biomedical Research, National Academy Press, 1985).  To implement the matrix will require a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and database technologies as well as an understanding of the structure of biological knowledge.  However, a full implementation of the Matrix is best not attempted until pilot studies on a restricted domain of knowledge have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the concept.  One domain of considerable general interest is that of nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries, which have become invaluable research tools for a large segment of the biomedical research community. In addition to the libraries themselves a large number of computer programs have been written to analyze the sequence data, which has resulted in major new discoveries.  The utility of these libraries to the typical laboratory investigator could be greatly enhanced by augmenting them with the types of knowledge management and reasoning systems envisioned for the Matrix. The goal of this proposed work is to build a testbed for the Matrix concept on top of the existing sequence libraries, benefitting both the larger goals of the Matrix and the immediate needs of sequence library users.  Steps in this process will include: (1) implementation of the GenBank database in a relational form, interfaced to an AI environment; (2) creation of a series of knowledge bases relating to the database, starting with simple taxonomies and progression to more complex representations (on narrower test domains); (3) creation of a set of user interfaces oriented to the needs of molecular biologist; and (4) investigation of various techniques of inference against the knowledge base, in particular reasoning by analogy, with the ultimate aim of allowing users to build and test hypotheses locally.

MENTOR COMPUTERIZED MONITORING OF THERAPEUTIC DECISIONS The goal of the MENTOR project is to implement and begin evaluation of a computer-based methodology for reducing therapeutic misadventures.  The project will use principles of artificial intelligence to create an on-line expert system to continuously monitor the drug therapy of individual patients and generate specific warnings of potential and/or actual unintended effects of therapy.  The appropriate patient information will be automatically acquired through interfaces to a hospital information system.  This data will be monitored by a system that is capable of employing complex chains of reasoning to evaluate therapeutic decisions and arrive at valid conclusions in the context of all information available on the patient.  The results reached by the system will be fed back to the responsible physicians to assist future decision making.  Specific objectives of this proposal include: 1. Implement a prototype computer-based expert system to continuously monitor in-patient drug therapy.  It will use a modular medical knowledge base and a separate inference engine to apply the knowledge to specific situations. 2. Select a small number of important and frequently occurring drug therapy problems that can lead to therapeutic misadventures and construct a comprehensive knowledge base necessary to detect these situations. 3.

"COMPUTER SIMULATION STUDIES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE In-vivo studies of the menstrual cycle present enormous challenges, as they deal with a complex entity which is the result of multiple interactions between a large number of variables, not all of which can be controlled at one time in an in-vivo setting. Adjunct or alternative approaches to the in-vivo study of the human reproductive cycle have been suggested, among which is the computer simulation approach.  This research proposal represents an attempt to evaluate the validity of this approach. The investigators propose to resume their studies with a computer model of the cyclic morphological and endocrine changes which characterize the menstrual cycle.  The proposal contains three practical aims.  The first aim is to refine the original menstrual cycle computer simulation model. This model was developed more than a decade ago; new data and concepts must now be evaluated, tested and, where required, integrated into the model.  The second aim is to develop a sophisticated user interface.  The model will be adapted to PC desktop type computer hardware and will incorporate principles of what are called ""expert system"" programs.  This will allow physiologists to test and use the computer model in a highly sophisticated, yet easily controllable fashion without the need for an extensive computer background.  The third aim is to test the utility of this computer modeling approach in an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an objective analysis of the model through their ability to log simulation results.  Ultimately, a refined and validated model of the menstrual cycle can be used to assist in both experimental design and result interpretation and thereby enhance knowledge gained from in-vivo experimentation.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs. Secondly, phantom studies will be applied to determine the imaging characteristics of the new techniques.  Thirdly, computer algorithms will be developed for quantitative analysis of the dynamic information recorded in the images.  Finally, preliminary clinical studies will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic imaging techniques.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.  The work will make modelling tools available for the analysis of large brain systems.

"SYMPTOM EVOLUTION IN APHASIA: A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY Two related projects are proposed as part of an application for a Research Career Development Award.  First, it is suggested that information about the evolution of patients' symptoms during recovery from aphasia will provide an important source of constraint on the postulation of explanatory models to account for particular aphasis syndromes.  Three separate experimental batteries are developed to investigate the nature of the underlying deficit in agrammatic Broca's aphasia, conduction aphasia and anomic aphasia.  Specific hypotheses are developed concerning the possible relationships among co-occuring symptoms and their underlying basis. Patients meeting the selection criteria will be tested at several intervals over the course of the first year post-onset using one of the experimental batteries.  A second project is proposed to develop a computer-based system for the simulation and classification of reading and writing errors produced by dyslexic and dysgraphic patients.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"MODEL FOR CHRONIC ALUMINUM TOXICITY Systemic aluminum produces encephalopathy and osteomalacia in humans, but environmental toxicity has been considered minimal because of low oral bioavailability.  However, in pilot work we have demonstrated neurotoxicity in lactating mice fed diets containing 500ppm aluminum, one order of magnitude above human exposure levels.  In addition, developmental toxicity including growth retardation, developmental delay and depressed immune function was seen in offspring.  In the proposed experiments, we have hypothesized that interaction with essential trace element metabolism leads to enhanced susceptibility to oral aluminum toxicity during developmental periods.  The experiments include studies of vulnerable periods, dose-response relationships, maternal-fetal transfer, interaction with trace metal deficient diets and definition of ""no observable adverse effect"" levels.  Swiss-Webster mice will be fed purified diets with precisely controlled levels of essential trace metals and supplemented with aluminum lactate at levels of 100, 500 or 1000 ppm elemental aluminum.  Diets will be fed for a six week period to nonpregnant, pregnant or lactating female mice.  The design includes pair fed controls.  Dams will be evaluated for neurotoxicity (functional signs and neurohistopathology), immunotoxicity and tissue concentrations of essential trace metals (Zn, Cu, Mg, Fe, Ca) and aluminum.  Offspring will also be evaluated for tissue trace metal levels as well as growth, developmental delay and behavioral and immune function.  Behavior and immune function will be evaluated at weaning and again two weeks after termination of aluminum exposure to determine residual effects.  Further experiments evaluating developmental and neurotoxicity will be selected by relying on a structured decision tree format.

"CONTEXT INFORMATION IN AUTOMATED CERVICAL SMEAR ANALYSIS The overall aim of this project is to improve automated cervical smear image analysis techniques sufficiently to:  1) routinely provide additional diagnostic information to supplement that provided by human visual examination, and 2) provide accurate, cost effective prescreening capabilities.  By furnishing additional quantitative diagnostic information, such automated systems would permit the practicing cytopathologist to make more accurate and refined diagnostic judgements, which would lead to improved patient management.  By providing a practical prescreening capability, such systems would increase the efficiency and efficacy of health care delivery.  Current automated cervical smear analysis research employs only the analysis of isolated cells, and practical automated analysis is not yet a reality.  The primary contribution of this project will be the completion of development and testing of image analysis techniques that extract information from cells and other objects as seen in the context of the ""background"" of the smear.  Specifically, cells, cell clusters, bare nuclei, and cytoplasmic fragments are analyzed and the resulting contextual features, slide-averaged ""features"" and high-resolution features describing single cells are combined to produce a more complete and accurate description of the smear.  This description will provide information not obtainable by human visual analysis, which can be used, 1) directly, to ascertain diagnostic clues, and 2) indirectly to make accurate prescreening possible.  An extensive pilot study has shown that the contextual analysis provides complementary information to that provided by single cell analysis.  That is, where single cell analysis seems to have difficulty, contextual analysis is most accurate - and vice versa. Thus we expect to demonstrate that the combination of our contextual analysis techniques with single cell analysis will give automated Pap smear analysis the additional screening accuracy that is needed.  The proposed project is a followup intended to:  a) validate the techniques of the pilot study, b) to expand the study to include parameters that provide additional diagnostic and prognostic information, and c) to generate specifications for a system to accomplish the analysis in a routine clinical laboratory environment.

"LINKAGE ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE LOCI This research is designed to investigate the efficient localization and ordering of major genes through linkage analysis.  Although new gene mapping methods and programs have emerged, significant capabilities are still lacking and many of the statistical concepts are dated.  Gene mapping can be divided into two phases:  1) initial assignment of a gene to a chromosomal region, and 2) assignment of gene order and map distance of the disease locus to all of the markers.  The issues of significance and efficiency are different for these phases.  In the first phase, we are testing for linkage between the disease locus and well-spaced highly polymorphic markers.  Three locus evaluation of expected LOD scores and actual LOD scores are sufficient.  We will investigate significance levels of the three locus analysis for testing linkage on saturated maps.  For fine mapping we will compute expected LOD scores and LOD scores for gene order with multiple loci.  We will also establish significance levels for comparison of orders.  The preliminary LOD scores sufficient to justify a switch in strategy from localization to establishing order will be described.  As the set of tools for calculating expected LOD scores and LOD scores are investigated, a knowledge-based expert system will be developed which will integrate these tools with the appropriate databases and rules. The system will be an automated tool assisting in designing the experiments, evaluating data from the experiments, and redesigning the experiment in light of the preliminary results.

"STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF INTERPHASE CHROMOSOMES The newly developed instrumentation and software now allows three-dimensional reconstruction, in a generalized fashion, of subcellular structures, at both the light and high voltage electron microscopic levels.  Eighteen nuclei have been reconstructed and interpreted in a quantitative fashion.  Six nuclei have their cytogenetic loci aligned with the three-dimensional structures showing that many chromosome features are three-dimensionally determined.  It is proposed to determine, three-dimensionally, many adjacent polytene nuclei in defined developmental stages and tissues so that it will be possible to see in a quantitative fashion the structural relationships. Many computational approaches are proposed to process the images, to refine the structures, to position the bands, hence genes three-dimensionally, and to determine the fine structure of nuclei.  These studies will also utilize monoclonal antibodies to localize active gene loci and their close associations one with another and the nuclear envelope, and to relate structure to function.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

"RESEARCH RESOURCE ON COMPUTERS IN BIOMEDICINE The general objective of the Rutgers Resource is to apply advanced methods of computer science, particularly artificial intelligence, to problems of biomedical research and practice.  The Resource promotes the development and use of computer systems for expert consultation in medical diagnosis and management, and for research assistance in processes of scientific experimentation and theory formation.  Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.  The major areas of biomedical application are in rheumatology, where we are collaborating with Drs. D. Lindberg and G. Sharp at the National Library of Medicine and University of Missouri-Columbia, in clinical pathology, where we are working with Dr. Robert Galen of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in ophthalmology, where we have an active collaboration with Dr. C.

We are proposing to continue these micro-based innovations for two applications: the interpretation of CPK/LDH isoenzymes for the diagnosis of heart attacks and a primary eye care program for developing countries.  We also propose to continue our research in rule refinement and empirical analysis of expert system knowledge bases.  In addition to the research activities of the Resource, we continue that highly successful dissemination activities of the AIM Workshop series and the Rutgers Resource participation in national AIM collaborative research.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).  These findings demonstrate that the prognostic accuracies can be improved by quantitative analyses over the routine histologic examinations.

Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.  The project aims to investigate whether computer science research in basic medical education will assist the integration of discrete medical facts into effective clinical decision making, both in the classroom environment and through clinical training.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC IMAGE INTERPRETATION The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinically useful, computer-based methodology to assist in decision-making tasks in medical imaging.  The methodology consists of a novel approach combining well-established mathematical methods and artificial intelligence techniques for simultaneously representing medical knowledge and handling visual information.  The specific aims of the proposed research are to develop, implement, test, and validate a knowledge-based system for interpreting three-dimensional thallium-201 myocardial distributions obtained by tomographic imaging.  These interpretations will assist clinicians in detecting and localizing coronary artery disease.  The research will be carried out in a collaboration between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, thus providing a unique, interdisciplinary, and interinstitutional approach that directs complementary clinical and scientific resources toward this important medical problem. The five-year research program consists of four projects, dealing with (1) knowledge representation, (2) image understanding, (3) clinical acceptance and validation, and (4) system extension and refinement.  Preliminary studies indicate that the methodology can provide both accurate cardiac image interpretations and graphical, computer-generated representations of arterial structure.  The approach can serve as a clinically useful model with applications to other imaging modalities, and can also be used as a tool for tutoring and training clinicians.  The knowledge-based system is designed to be sufficiently extensible and flexible to accommodate the far-term objectives of eventually providing decision-making support to clinicians in tasks associated with diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"CCD DETECTOR DEVELOPMENT FOR DIGITAL X-RAY MAMMOGRAPHY A high resolution scanned projection radiography system is proposed for digital mammorgraphic applications.  By using a wide dynamic range CCD detector some of the current limitations encountered in conventional film-screen mammography can be avoided.  One-dimensional fan-beam geometry provides very good scattered x-ray reduction.  A time-delay-and-integrate (TDI) mode of CCD imaging with a 2048 x 96 element CCD array provides the opportunity to image without the excessive power loading of x-ray tubes which would be required with a 2048 x 1 array, for example.  By utilizing TDI charge integration while the detector is scanned, each projection through stationary anatomy is averaged over 96 exposures, thereby providing a significant signal to quantum mottle improvement of approximately 10:1 as compared to a 2048 x 1 detector at the equivalent tube loading. Developmental tasks to be performed include construction of a TDI CCD x-ray detector in which the light output of an x-ray intensifying screen is coupled by means of a lens to the CCD focal plane, measurement of the x-ray sensitivity, noise characteristics and homogeneity of the x-ray detector construction of a moving sample x-ray imaging system based on the TDI detector, and determination of the optimum x-ray spectrum for digital mammorgraphic imaging tasks in order to evaluate its clinical potential.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.

"SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF EVOKED POTENTIALS This research seeks to increase the information obtained from noninvasive evoked potential (EP) studies by developing (1) techniques which separate the contributions of temporally overlapping generators from the surface-recorded data, and (2) improved models for the volume conduction mechanisms which relate generator location to surface topography.  These techniques will be applied to analysis of human short-latency auditory EPs and subcortical and cortical somatosensory EPs to median and peroneal nerve stimulation.  Human EPs recorded intracranially during neurosurgery will be used for verification and optimization of the models and techniques.  Estimated generator waveforms will be defined by principal component analysis of surface topographic mappings with rotation of the factors, and examined in normal subjects and in patients with neurologic disease.  In the patient group, the sensitivity of the test and its ability to localize areas of dysfunction will be compared to those of conventionally interpreted EPs.  The volume conduction processes by which the surface potentials are derived from activity in distant generators will be examined through a numeric or finite-differences computer model.  Such a model takes into account the anatomy of conductance inhomogeneities within the head, and should more accurately represent volume conduction of human EPs than models assuming spherical symmetry.  The ""forward"" volume conduction model defines the surface distribution produced by a hypothetical array of generators; the ""inverse"" problem will be approached by heurisitically modifying the generator hypotheses to obtain the best fit between the predicted surface topography and the empirical data.  The techniques developed in the course of these studies of specific EPs are also applicable to the analysis of surface- recorded event-related potentials produced by various other stimuli and by cognitive and motor tasks.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.  With the established measures and model, we will scan the GenBank database for anomalously curved regions, and determine whether or not they are correlated with the functional roles of coincident or neighboring sequences.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

"INVESTIGATION OF PROBLEM-SOLVING & MAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS We propose a five year program of investigation into problem- solving in immunohematology, leading to the development of a knowledge-based decision support system and a prototype intelligent tutoring system.  Initially, the techniques and methodologies of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence will be used in tandem to investigate the problem-solving of practitioners in immunohematology at various levels of expertise.  During this period the knowledge and problem-solving used by individuals performing various interpretation tasks in immunohematology will be described from an information processing perspective.  This description will be performed within the context of the generic task theory of problem-solving, which has proven successful in constructing expert systems in a variety of medical fields.  In order to more fully understand the performance of immunohematologists, both correct/expert performance and error-producing behavior will be modeled.  The resultant models will then be used as the basis for developing knowledge-based systems to support the education and practice of immunohematology.

"DIGITAL VIEWING STATIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES The arrival of high speed digital electronic communication in radiological sciences is gradually changing the method of acquiring, communicating, storing, and viewing diagnostic images. One natural development due to this change is the emergence of the digital radiology department.  In the previous study we demonstrated the feasibility of such a development by designing and implementing two clinical multiple digital viewing stations in the Pediatric Radiology Section.  During this study related technological problems which had hindered such development were also solved.  They were:  (1) the conversion of conventional radiographic images into high resolution digital images by using a laser film scanner and a computed radiographic system, (2) development of a digital optical disk storage system for mass image storage, and (3) the installation of a broadband communication system for rapid networking of images.  The purpose of this research proposal is to continue this development and to have a complete digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section in the Radiological Sciences Department within five years.  This digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section includes patient registration, image acquisition, mass storage, network communication, and image viewing.  The first two years will be used for the integration of various components into a total digital viewing system and to gain clinical acceptance.  The third year will be for clinical trials of the complete digital-based operation.  The fourth year will be for phasing out of the film- based operation and extending the digital viewing system capabilities to the pediatric department and to the genitourinary radiology section.  The last year will be used for clinical evaluations and planning of the total digital viewing system for the entire department.  It is anticipated that this project will become a success because we have met all the technological requirements as well as have considered and studied the psychological implications of a digital review system.  The importance of building and evaluating such a digital viewing system as an alternate method for the current film-based operation is obvious since a successful execution of the current project will change the direction of viewing radiological images in the future.  These changes will have an important impact on improving health care delivery services.

"METHOD FOR FEATURE ANALYSIS IN MEDICAL IMAGING Research will be undertaken with the long-term objective of improving the means by which the performance of imaging technologies is assessed.  The increased complexity and the dynamic nature of the medical imaging field--in particular, the proliferation of CT scans and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging--make especially apparent now the need for improved measures of assessment.  Such improved measures can be expected to lead to more appropriate use of those technologies.  The proposed project has two overall aims:  first, the develop improved methods of assessing diagnostic accuracy; and second, to test and demonstrate these methods with three imaging technologies, as used with a single organ and disease--i.e. mammography, thermography, and diaphanography in the diagnosis of breast cancer.  A methodology will be developed for defining the perceptual features of an image or set or images that are of diagnostic importance, and for determining the optimal combination of these features in a diagnostic judgment.  This methodology will further include techniques for training image interpreters to use the features according to the optimal prescription as well as computer-based decision aids to reinforce the optimal behavior in routine practice.  A fundamental idea is that measures of accuracy, which underlie measures of utility, should reflect the best, practically attainable, performance of the technology.  The proposed methodology elicits information about perceptual features from experts in a technology and diagnostic problem by means of structured interviews and group discussions.  It corroborates and refines the main features by mathematical techniques of multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering as based on similarity judgments of pairs of images.  Discriminant analysis is used to establish a final set of features and their optimal weights.  A computer classifier is developed to accept interpreters' ratings of the features and to issue a probability estimate for the diagnosis under consideration.  Preliminary studies, based on mammographic images, indicate that this methodology can produce a very substantial gain in diagnostic accuracy.  The product of this project will be a publication clearly describing the new methodology, so that it can be generally applied by clinical investigators in technology assessment.  Further, the empirical comparison of the accuracies of three technologies, and the determination of their accuracy in various combinations, will be of immediate import for the medical community.

"RADIOTRACER R & D IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND NEUROSCIENCE The availability of PET as a tool for research in biology and medicine has expanded significantly in the past decade along with the sophistication of the instrumentation and the diversity of radiotracers which are being applied to specific problems in biology and medicine.  The major scientific goal of this proposal is to address the key research issues in radiotracer chemistry and biochemistry which are required to accelerate the application of PET to new problems in biology and medicine.  Specific aims include high level economical production of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 on medical cyclotrons, mechanistic and synthetic chemistry as it relates to radiotracer synthesis and analytical control, radiotracer design and biochemistry as a linkage between PET measurements and the physiological process itself and automation of radiotracer production, and analysis including the use of knowledge-based artificial intelligence for rapid diagnosis of problems.  New radiotracers for assessing degree of malignancy in brain tumors by measuring functional ornithine decarboxylase activity (using 5-11C-ornithine) will be developed.  A new approach to radiotracer design, the use of 11C-labeled suicide inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) to assess functional enzyme activity initiated during this grant period will be further exploited.  The introduction of a major new thrust, the use of PET as a scientific tool in pharmaceutical research and development for new therapeutic drugs, will begin with the synthesis of positron emitter labeled drugs such as (11C) midazolam, a recently introduced benzodiazepine receptor active drug used in pre-anesthetic sedation.  Because of the growing importance of fluorine-18 for high resolution PET studies, and for measuring biological processes over a time interval of several hours, new approaches to its economical production in high yield on medical cyclotrons employing reusable solid 18O-targets and its efficient incorporation into a wide spectrum of 18F-tracers through the general synthesis of 3-(18F) fluoropropyl derivatives of biologically active compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET to address important scientific and medical issues will also be undertaken with a view to the economical supply of radiotracers from a central medical cyclotron-chemistry resource to satellite clinical PET facilities and to the pharmaceutical industry.

"SELF-TRAINING, SELF-OPTIMIZING INFRARED EXPERT SYSTEM With the advent of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) instrumentation, IR techniques have seen increasing application in the area of environmental analysis.  Environmental analysis applications of FTIR include the characterization of hazardous waste mixtures and the speciation and quantitation of airborne vapors and gases both in ambient air, vehicular emissions and the workplace.  The most commonly applied method of spectral identification uses forward searching of infrared spectral libraries.  This method succeeds where the compound and the resulting spectrum is pure, or where the spectrum of a commercial mixture is available.  The method fails in the case of the spectra of mixtures that are not stored as mixtures in the library.  Methods of identifying the compounds in the spectra of mixtures, especially in environmental mixtures, have been pioneered by our group, based on the work of Woodruff, et al, and Herget, et al.  This approach was achieved through the use of a three level rule structure for each peak, giving increasing ""goodness"" scores for each peak in successively narrower frequency windows.  At the heart of the programs that are used to accomplish either compound or compound class identification are PAIRS and PAWMI.  This proposal is aimed at research that will enable these programs to self-train and self- optimize.  Specifically, the hypothesis is:  A self-training, self-optimizing expert system can be developed to identify the components of mixtures of environmental significance using infrared spectrocopy.  1.  Optimization of weighting factors for peak goodness based on frequency of occurrence of peaks in each wavenumber window for given training sets. 2.  Optimization of peak window widths for rules containing three peak position windows for each expected absorption. 3.  Incorporation of a program to deconvove overlapping peaks. 4.  Incorporation of the automated rule generator, the automated rule optimizer, the deconvolution and peak picking programs, and the mixture interpretation program into one expert system applicable to both condensed and vapor phase species.  Each of the above specific aims involves basic research into the use of expert systems for spectroscopic analysis.  This research will be conducted using appropriate training sets of environmental significance.

"COLLAGEN POLYMORPHISM IN NORMAL AND CIRRHOTIC LIVER In the two years of the granting period we have completed the localization by light and electron microscopy of four components of the hepatic extracellular matrix in normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  Collagen deposition in our system is a late event in the cirrhotic process, the earliest detectable change, is increased synthesis of fibronectin by the hepatocyte with subsequent deposition of this fibronectin in the space of Disse.  Our working hypothesis is that not only does fibronectin play a critical role in the fibrotic process, but that this role may be mediated by post-translational modifications in the fibronectin secreted by the injured hepatocyte.  We are proposing to complete the morphological studies initiated two years ago, obtaining precise quantitation (with computer-aided image analysis) of the changes in the hepatic extracellular matrix in the normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic liver.  New studies include:  The reversal of the cirrhosis induced by CCl4 and characterization and quantitation of the catabolism of this extracellular matrix during the reversal of the cirrhosis.  These studies will use light and electron immunohistochemistry combined with image analysis.  To characterize and quantitate the matrix produced by primary cultures of hepatocytes obtained from normal, fibrotic and cirrhotic livers using immunohistochemistry, quantitative rocket immunoelectrophoresis and electroimmunobloting.  We will use in vitro sublethal hepatocyte injury with CCl4 and compare the matrix secreted in vitro by these injured hepatocytes with that secreted by normal hepatocytes.  The last part of the proposal will initiate studies designed to characterize any possible changes in the fibronectin secreted by hepatocytes as a response to injury.  Plasma and tissue fibronectin from rats exposed to CCl4 will be compared with plasma and tissue fibronectin from normal rats.  The fibronectins will be characterized by PAGE, IEF, electroimmunoblotting and crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis with ConA in the first dimension.

"COMPUTERIZED DENSITOMETRY OF NEUROCHEMICALS Techniques of quantitative autoradiography have been employed to gain insights to chemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of brain function.  We will refine the method of quantitative autoradiography to allow more precise assessments of neurotransmitter receptors and drug binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS).  Particular attention will be directed to the problem of quenching of tritium emissions by white matter, and we will establish criteria for introducing quench corrections in studies involving human tissue.  We will extend studies on the quantitative autoradiography of monoamine uptake sites, utilizing the antidepressant compounds desmethylimipramine and imipramine to identify, respectively, uptake sites for norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT). Studies will be conducted to examine the ontogeny of monoamine uptake sites, possible sex differences, regulation of these sites and their distribution in post-mortem human brain.  Further studies will examine monoamine receptors, and compare the distribution of monoamine uptake sites and receptors.  The ontogeny of betal and beta2 adrenergic receptors will be examined, as will the cellular location of these selective subtypes, using the selective neurotoxin ibotenic acid.

"ATTENTIONAL DEFICIT CHILDREN:  A DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS This study will map certain dimensional aspects of personality (impulsivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking) and laboratory measures of nervous system sensitivity in 200 heterogeneous, clinically and school referred attention deficit disordered (ADD) subjects (structured interview diagnosis) and 50 controls.  Behavioral and physiological measures will be obtained during augmentation-reduction and signal detection procedures.  The primary goal is to construct a decision tree that will enhance the DSM-III diagnosis of ADD subjects in the sense of making it more predictive of clinical outcome at follow-up.  Past research of ours and others indicates that an augmentation-reduction procedure, in which the individual responds to tones of increasing intensity, differentiates hyperactive ADD children from controls and is predictive of therapeutic drug dose.  We will attempt to replicate and extend these results using signal detection techniques which would appear to be superior to augmenting procedures for purposes of studying nervous system sensitivity and attentional processes.  Russian investigators refer to sensitivity as strength.  This is assessed by them as a subject's ability to detect stimuli low in intensity and/or to withstand strong stimuli.  We extend this definition to include four hypothesized relatively independent dimensions:  sensitivity to tones low and high in intensity and sensitivity to reward and punishment.  These four laboratory measures will be correlated with dimensional aspects of personality, including impulsivity, aggressivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking.  Subjects will be grouped post hoc in several ways:  (a) on the basis of DSM-III diagnosis; (b) on the basis of DSM-III and personality attributes; (c) on the basis of DSM-III diagnoses and sensitivity indices; and (d) on the basis of DSM-III, personality, and sensitivity measures.  We hypothesize that (b), (c) and (d) will be more predictive of clinical outcome than (a).  We also expect (b) to correlate more closely with the laboratory measures of sensitivity than (a), but expect (b) and (c) to be independent predictors of outcome and to correlate about equally with outcome.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL  SYNTHESIS The major objective of this work is the application of digital computers to the derivation of synthetic pathways to complex organic structures.  A general problem-solving program, LHASA (Logic and Heuristics Applied to Synthetic Analysis), is being developed which can be used interactively by a chemist with simple graphical input-output of structural formulas.  The principles and strategies of organic synthesis are being formalized for use by the program.  A variety of strategies including long-range search capabilities are being employed in the program.

"DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS This proposal seeks funding for a newly established Center for Complex Systems at Florida ATlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.  The main scientific goal of the Center is to understand how a complex biological system containing very many degrees of freedom (e.g. neurons, muscles, vascular processes) generates ordered behavior or macroscopic, spatiotemporal patterns.  This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.

"DISCRETE VS. CONTINUOS MODELS OF VISUAL PERCEPTION Two very different types of models of visual perception have been used by researchers in the fields of cognitive psychology and human information processing.  Discrete models characterized visual perception as a discrete operation that must completely finish processing a stimulus before any further cognitive processes receive information about that stimulus (e.g., Sternberg, 1969a). Continuous models characterize it as a continuous operation that gradually transmits information about a stimulus to later cognitive processes, so that these processes can begin before perception is finished (e.g., McClelland, 1979).  It is important for both theoretical and methodological reasons to be able to discriminate between these two types of models, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop experimental tests that can choose between them.  The proposed experiments emphasize two lines of research.  One set of experiments will use psychophysiological measurements to look for evidence that some response preparation has occurred before stimulus perception has finished.  Previous studies have sought evidence of such preliminary response preparation using indirect measures based on total response latency, and results have been subject to alternative explanations.  Using electrophysiological measures including the electromyogram (EMG) and event-related cerebral potentials (ERPs), it should be possible to measure preliminary response preparation more directly.  These measures will be obtained in several different experimental paradigms yielding effects previously attributed to preliminary response preparation, and they will indicate whether such preparation is actually responsible for these effects.  Such preliminary response preparation would be consistent with continuous, but not discrete, models of perceptual processes.  The second set of experiments will use reaction time measurements to study visual attention.  If it can be established that attentional emphasis continuously modulates the output of perceptual processes (rather than their use by late processes), then this would constitute broad support for models with continuous rather than discrete activation of stimulus codes.  The results of these studies will be of interest to cognitive psychologists, human factors engineers and designers of interfaces for human/computer interaction, and researchers in some areas of artificial intelligence.

"COMPUT. ASSISTED DECISION SUPPORT/OUTCOMES OF NURS. CARE The purpose of the proposed factorial study is to determine if use of decision support guidelines derived from a computerized expert system in nursing offers advantages in time savings and quality of care planning when compared to traditional resources available for nurses' patient care planning.  RN volunteers (N=100) who vary on attributes of (1) type of education and (2) nursing experience will serve as their own controls in planning patient care based on specific case situations under three different conditions:  (1) traditional - use of limited resources including a nursing textbook, nursing handbook and Physicians Desk Reference for drugs, (2) Use of decision support guidelines and optional resource library, and (3) Use of decision support guidelines which cite specific key resources for information from the optional resource library.  The presentation of the case studies and conditions will be counterbalanced to control for effects of the testing situation in this repeated measures design.  Three expert nurses will do ratings of the 100 care plans written for the case studies, each in her area of content expertise.  They will not know the names of the subjects nor the testing condition under which a care plan was written.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"QUANTITATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION IN CELLS The objective of this project is to develop quantitative estrogen receptor concentration measurements using high resolution digital image microscopy techniques.  These techniques will enable direct measurements of receptor concentration in tissue and cells.  This is an improvement over the current biochemical assays which only give an average value for receptor concentration in a homogenized specimen sample which may contain varying proportions of malignant cells.  The assay proposed will 1) measure the concentration of receptors in cell populations, 2) the proportion of cells in a tumor population that have estrogen receptor above a certain concentration level.  The recent development of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptors makes the development of methods for immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptors feasible.  Additional recent advances in quantitative imaging cytology can be combined with this to develop a fast, efficient and more accurate assay method and to eliminate the visual subjective components of the method. This combination of these new techniques to produce a new quantitative assay is particularly important since it has already been shown that patients whose tumors contain estrogen receptors will have a higher probability of responding to hormonal therapy, and seem to have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors do not contain this receptor.

"DEVELOP A SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY LANGUAGE - MEDLISH Current scientific bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE) now play a very central role in literature activities.  They are important and they are widely used.  However, the information expressed in the TITLE, ABSTRACT and MeSH INDEX fields in these databases is quite chaotic and sketchy compared with the structure of many other kinds of databases.  Because of these deficiencies, computerized literature searches are imprecise and merely retrieve records based on the presence of ""keywords,"" rather than via a precise ""match on concept"" condition, such as is possible with relational databases and other orderly data structures.  In this SBIR program we propose to make a small database containing the kind of information that is in ordinary abstracts, but to express it in a new ""scientific language"" (MEDLISH), that we (ISG) have been developing.  Unlike English, MEDLISH enforces order, scientific precision and logic on the entries.  At the conclusion of Phase I we will have completed the design, made a sample database, and finished the implementation plans.  In Phase II we then would make the marketable product.

"COMPUTER CONSULTANT FOR OPTIMAL NMR IMAGING Medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new expensive imaging modality which avoids ionizing radiation and provides excellent diagnostic images.  The images produced depend on both the properties of the patient's tissues and the radiologist controlled parameters of the MRI scanner.  When scanner parameters are selected with clearcut objectives accounting for the patients's history, anatomic relationships and the MR properties of relevant tissues, accurate diagnostic images result. There are expert MRI radiologists who understand these tradeoffs, and use heuristic reasoning to simplify the mathematical and clinical complexity.  Their expertise can be encoded into a knowledge-based expert computer system.  Specifically, we propose to accomplish the following research:  1. Using existing methods of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, construct a first prototype expert system. It will be designed to incorporate the following functionality: o  Be a useful consultant for twenty representative situations involving the anatomy of the head, such as multiple sclerorsis, acoustic neuroma and pituitary adenoma. o  In a given clinical setting, produce a set of MR imaging parameters optimal for determining if a specific disease process is present. o  Be able to explain its reasoning in terms comprehensible to radiologists.  2.  Explore different inference strategies for reasoning about complex MRI physics interactions, such as constraint algorithms and mixed forward/backward chaining approaches.  3.

"PHYSIOLOGIC KNOWLEDGE--ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS It has been recognized that one of the limitations of the ""first generation"" of medical artificial intelligence systems was the phenomenological nature of the knowledge to which they had access.  To perform effectively in difficult diagnostic and therapeutic situations, such programs will need knowledge bases which are sufficiently rich to enable them to reason about pathophysiological mechanisms.  Thus, the representation of the domain knowledge of physiology is becoming an important part of the development of such systems.  In this research, several problems inherent in representing and reasoning about complex physiological knowledge will be investigated in the context of developing a medical knowledge base and building a module which uses physiological reasoning to aid in evaluating diagnostic hypotheses and therapeutic plans.  The module will have access to a knowledge base which contains the domain knowledge of a subset of renal basic physiology, as well as clinical knowledge about fluid and electrolyte disturbances.  Its performance will be evaluated by integration into a system with components which generate diagnostic hypotheses, therapy plans, and explanations of the system's reasoning and output.  The following issues will be explored:  a. qualitative vs. quantitative representation of parameter values and qualitative reasoning or simulation vs. numerical calculation; b. temporal representation and reasoning; c. classification of causal mechanisms, with emphasis on concepts specific to the domain of physiology.  The above issues are relevant to the field of knowledge representation at large.  Thus, the proposed investigation may lead to the development of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques which are particularly adapted to the domain of renal physiology but may have wider applicability as well.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION The characterization of the structure of a biomolecule on the its  chemical and spectral properties is of widespread importance in the biomedical sciences.  Because of its complexity, structure characterization is overall a time-consuming activity that has been largely left to experts in the field.  The goal of this research is to substantially increase the productivity of those experts.  Given the expert's proficiency in readily picking out the correct structure of an unknown from among a limited number of alternative structures, a much more expeditious assignment of structure would be achieved if the expert could begin the structure characterization problem with such a conceptually manageable number of plausible alternatives.  Thus, the goal of the research is to create artificial intelligence based computer software capable of directly reducing the collective spectral properties (infrared, proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet and mass spectral data) of the unknown to a conceptually manageable number of stereochemically defined structures, each of which is compatible with the observed spectral data.  The expert is still a required player, but is spared what is actually the time-intensive component of the ""manual"" process, that of producing the limited number of alternatives.

"ROLE OF Z BAND IN CARDIAC SARCOMERE In heart muscle cells, the contractile units must be linked by Z bands for effective contraction.  The Z band is a complex protein lattice which is an integral part of the contractile apparatus, but its exact role in contraction is not known.  Z bands vary in width in normal and diseased muscles, but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods, we have identified a common structural unit in Z bands of mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle.  Our optical reconstruction studies show a regular arrangement of axial and cross connecting filaments.  However, the Z band is rarely a uniform lattice, because there is variation in the arrangement of cross connecting filaments.  Two different lattice forms, basket weave and small square are observed and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure capable of responding to different physiological states of the muscle.  Our purpose in these studies is to examine structural differences in the Z band lattice between cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, between slow and fast skeletal muscle, between adult and developing muscle, between normal and diseased muscle and to correlate them with specific structural states induced experimentally.  We will generate a three dimensional reconstruction of the Z band by computerized image processing of a tilt series of electron micrographs.  Then we can determine the impact of specific rearrangements within the lattice in different muscle types in different physiological states.  Using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, we will examine Z bands 1) in normal muscles fixed or frozen before, during, and after tetanic contraction; 2) in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3) in isolated myofibrils; and 4) in postnatally developing intact muscle.  A systematic analysis will be used to answer two questions.  Why does the lattice move?  How is the Z band formed?  The emphasis will be on the three dimensional structure of the Z band lattice.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"SYMBOLIC SIMULATION OF DNA METABOLISM Using established methods of knowledge representation and rule- based expert systems I propose to develop a symbolic simulation of DNA metabolism.  Rule-based expert systems permit simulations of DNA metabolism which can predict the activity of both individual enzymes and of entire pathways under a wide variety of physiological conditions.  Both classical production rules and an assumption-based truth maintenance system will be used.  Rule-based methods have the intrinsic property of being able to explain conclusions using English sentences or graphic representations of the pattern of inference.  The enzymes, substrates and products will also be represented in a frame-based knowledge system.  Knowledge based systems facilitate the description of product-precursor relationships between different metabolites as well as the complete pathway.  Physiological conditions such as the presence of salts, nucleotides, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc. will be presented graphically as active images of thermometers, gauges and switches.  All environmental and substrate conditions can be changed by using a mouse pointing device.  In response to changes of any parameter, a series of rules defining the specificity and reactivity of enzymes are automatically invoked and specific conclusions are made. The methods for specifying the actions of enzymes are well defined, allowing ready simulation of other enzymes.  Simulations of individual enzymatic steps can be coupled together to generate a discrete event simulation of the entire metabolic pathway.

"COMPUTER SIMULATION STUDIES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE In-vivo studies of the menstrual cycle present enormous challenges, as they deal with a complex entity which is the result of multiple interactions between a large number of variables, not all of which can be controlled at one time in an in-vivo setting. Adjunct or alternative approaches to the in-vivo study of the human reproductive cycle have been suggested, among which is the computer simulation approach.  This research proposal represents an attempt to evaluate the validity of this approach. The investigators propose to resume their studies with a computer model of the cyclic morphological and endocrine changes which characterize the menstrual cycle.  The proposal contains three practical aims.  The first aim is to refine the original menstrual cycle computer simulation model. This model was developed more than a decade ago; new data and concepts must now be evaluated, tested and, where required, integrated into the model.  The second aim is to develop a sophisticated user interface.  The model will be adapted to PC desktop type computer hardware and will incorporate principles of what are called ""expert system"" programs.  This will allow physiologists to test and use the computer model in a highly sophisticated, yet easily controllable fashion without the need for an extensive computer background.  The third aim is to test the utility of this computer modeling approach in an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an objective analysis of the model through their ability to log simulation results.  Ultimately, a refined and validated model of the menstrual cycle can be used to assist in both experimental design and result interpretation and thereby enhance knowledge gained from in-vivo experimentation.

"STRUCTURAL DETERMINATION OF INTERPHASE CHROMOSOMES The newly developed instrumentation and software now allows three-dimensional reconstruction, in a generalized fashion, of subcellular structures, at both the light and high voltage electron microscopic levels.  Eighteen nuclei have been reconstructed and interpreted in a quantitative fashion.  Six nuclei have their cytogenetic loci aligned with the three-dimensional structures showing that many chromosome features are three-dimensionally determined.  It is proposed to determine, three-dimensionally, many adjacent polytene nuclei in defined developmental stages and tissues so that it will be possible to see in a quantitative fashion the structural relationships. Many computational approaches are proposed to process the images, to refine the structures, to position the bands, hence genes three-dimensionally, and to determine the fine structure of nuclei.  These studies will also utilize monoclonal antibodies to localize active gene loci and their close associations one with another and the nuclear envelope, and to relate structure to function.  Diploid nuclei will, in addition, be three-dimensionally reconstructed at highest possible light microscope resolution in intact Drosophila embryos. Questions related to differences in the 3D patterns of the interphase chromosomes as a function of development, and the cell cycle will be studied.  The laboratory will continue to reconstruct mitotic chromosomes and interband/bands from polytene chromosomes from Drosophila in a resolution-overlaping fashion made possible by the three-dimensional light microscopy and much higher resolution of the high voltage electron microscope utilizing systematic high tilt about 70 degrees for three-dimensional structure.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.

Organizing and representing biomedical knowledge at different levels (descriptive, ruled-based mathematical submodels), and relating the levels through generalized strategies for communication and control with a user, constitutes a major component of our proposed reseach.  We continue the present structure of the Resource, with a set of core projects concentrating on general artificial intelligence investigations, and a set of collaborative projects that provide the context within which the methods can be tested.

"LINKAGE ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE LOCI This research is designed to investigate the efficient localization and ordering of major genes through linkage analysis.  Although new gene mapping methods and programs have emerged, significant capabilities are still lacking and many of the statistical concepts are dated.  Gene mapping can be divided into two phases:  1) initial assignment of a gene to a chromosomal region, and 2) assignment of gene order and map distance of the disease locus to all of the markers.  The issues of significance and efficiency are different for these phases.  In the first phase, we are testing for linkage between the disease locus and well-spaced highly polymorphic markers.  Three locus evaluation of expected LOD scores and actual LOD scores are sufficient.  We will investigate significance levels of the three locus analysis for testing linkage on saturated maps.  For fine mapping we will compute expected LOD scores and LOD scores for gene order with multiple loci.  We will also establish significance levels for comparison of orders.  The preliminary LOD scores sufficient to justify a switch in strategy from localization to establishing order will be described.  As the set of tools for calculating expected LOD scores and LOD scores are investigated, a knowledge-based expert system will be developed which will integrate these tools with the appropriate databases and rules. The system will be an automated tool assisting in designing the experiments, evaluating data from the experiments, and redesigning the experiment in light of the preliminary results.  Thus, the large number of linkage experiments carried out in the near future can be performed efficiently.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate new approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems.  Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  Industrial statistics show that even though major catastrophies and disasters from chemical plant failures are infrequent, minor accidents are very common, occurring on a day to day basis, resulting in many occupational injuries and illnesses, costing the society billions of dollars every year.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble- shooting.  We propose to improve this status by designing systems that would have better modeling of the problem-solving process through an appropriate representation of the domain knowledge through the use of causal modeling and reasoning from first principles, similar to human experts, by exploiting some of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence.  We propose a methodology that aids the development of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, resilient under unforeseen fault combinations, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults.  The domain knowledge of the system is based on a library of fault and causal models of process equipments as well as on the physical interconnections between equipment units and causal relationships among process state variables.  The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior.  We describe a prototype expert system, called MODEX, based on our methodology.  The system has performed successfully on test cases of prototypical chemical process plants and looks promising.  However, before a successful transfer of this methodology to the industry can be initiated a number of research issues outlined in the proposal need to be resolved by experimenting with larger prototypical chemical plants.

"EARLY DETECTION OF CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT MELANOMA Melanoma is the most lethal skin-cancer.  The occurrence rate of malignant melanoma among the white population is rising faster than almost any other cancer in North America.  Nearly all patients can be saved and cured by early detection and prompt surgical treatment.  The important diagnostic and prognostic variables of melanoma are the vertical thickness, three- dimensional (3D) size and shape, and color of the lesion.  The other characteristic features of early melanoma are irregularities in the boundary of the lesion, and the appearance of non-uniform pigmentation with a variety of color.  The initial changes are subtle and cannot be observed with the naked eye.  A novel optical instrument called the ""Nevoscope"" has been developed to view the multiple images of the lesion in situ from several angles by transilluminating the skin-lesion.  The multiple views have been digitized and 3D images of the lesion have been reconstructed to measure the thickness and 3D size.  The objective of this research is to improve the design and performance of the Nevoscope, to perform analysis on thickness, 3D size, color, and margin, boundary and surface characteristics to detect early malignant lesions.  The approach proposed here is based on the knowledge-based analysis and interpretation of the images of the transilluminated skin-lesion.

"MULTIMODALITY CARDIAC IMAGE UNDERSTANDING An image understanding system is proposed to analyze cardiac dysfunction found by combining information from multiple, noninvasive imaging modality studies.  The system is a model for intelligent multimodality image understanding in general, but is applied to a very specific problem:  detection and rating of left ventricular (LV) aneurysms.  Key features of the system are:  1) its ability to handle and quantify uncertain or partial image- derived information in a concise way using probabilistic evidential reasoning, 2) its ability to fuse pertinent relative information from independent diagnostic images of the same patient to achieve an algorithm-assembled, consensus, quantitative opinion of cardiac shape and motion, and finally 3) to arrive at a decision- level set of numbers that quantify and localize left ventricular aneurysm formation for each patient.  The availability of data such as described in 3) will enable more precise prognostic or diagnostic risk classification for patients, making therapy alternatives more rational.  Because of the subjective probabilistic reasoning strategy (based on the principle of maximum entropy) the final quantitative results will carry not only the system's assessment of a particular patients' heart, but also the degree of confidence that the automated analysis system has in the result it presents.  This confidence is increased when similar LV motion and shape is perceived by the multiple imaging modalities.  The proposed system design is influenced by current artificial intelligence and image understanding technologies, but remains firmly grounded in more classical mathematical and statistical methodology.  The system will be initially tested using radionuclide angiographic (RNA) and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) semi- quantified (manual tracing of LV borders) and then fully quantified (by the system's own border-finding algorithm) studies and compared with qualitative readings, quantified contrast ventriculograms, and then with surgeon's and pathologist's measurements and reports.  Preliminary studies show that 1) RNA left lateral view qualitative studies correlate well with pathology, 2) that complementary 2DE views help resolve RNA problems with finding the anterior LV wall and 3) quantification of LV motion and shape better defines the spectrum between normal and grossly abnormal.  Subsequent incorporation of magnetic resonance images (which have improved LV boundary definition) into the evaluation system will test its ability to adapt to and profit from new types of data.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM The Committee on Models for Biomedical Research has proposed a ""matrix of biological knowledge"" (Matrix) to address the need for a means to organize and intelligently access the wealth of information that confronts biomedical researchers (c.f. Models for Biomedical Research, National Academy Press, 1985).  To implement the matrix will require a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and database technologies as well as an understanding of the structure of biological knowledge.  However, a full implementation of the Matrix is best not attempted until pilot studies on a restricted domain of knowledge have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the concept.  One domain of considerable general interest is that of nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries, which have become invaluable research tools for a large segment of the biomedical research community. In addition to the libraries themselves a large number of computer programs have been written to analyze the sequence data, which has resulted in major new discoveries.  The utility of these libraries to the typical laboratory investigator could be greatly enhanced by augmenting them with the types of knowledge management and reasoning systems envisioned for the Matrix. The goal of this proposed work is to build a testbed for the Matrix concept on top of the existing sequence libraries, benefitting both the larger goals of the Matrix and the immediate needs of sequence library users.  Steps in this process will include: (1) implementation of the GenBank database in a relational form, interfaced to an AI environment; (2) creation of a series of knowledge bases relating to the database, starting with simple taxonomies and progression to more complex representations (on narrower test domains); (3) creation of a set of user interfaces oriented to the needs of molecular biologist; and (4) investigation of various techniques of inference against the knowledge base, in particular reasoning by analogy, with the ultimate aim of allowing users to build and test hypotheses locally.

Included among these techniques are receptor and radiolabeled tracer autoradiography which reveal detailed functional and distributional information about neural activity and mechanisms.  Center research falls into two broad categories:  parcellation, or rapid and reproducible identification of the boundaries of subareas in histological images, and quantification, or the measurement of the relative or absolute values of underlying substance values from optical images of these regions.  The parcellation project utilizes expert system technology for knowledge based image analysis.  Quantification projects include the development of a computerized system for the determination of local thickness of variation, of computer techniques for the detection of local variations within brain regions, and for the quantification of autoradiograms.

"RADIOTRACER R & D IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND NEUROSCIENCE The availability of PET as a tool for research in biology and medicine has expanded significantly in the past decade along with the sophistication of the instrumentation and the diversity of radiotracers which are being applied to specific problems in biology and medicine.  The major scientific goal of this proposal is to address the key research issues in radiotracer chemistry and biochemistry which are required to accelerate the application of PET to new problems in biology and medicine.  Specific aims include high level economical production of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 on medical cyclotrons, mechanistic and synthetic chemistry as it relates to radiotracer synthesis and analytical control, radiotracer design and biochemistry as a linkage between PET measurements and the physiological process itself and automation of radiotracer production, and analysis including the use of knowledge-based artificial intelligence for rapid diagnosis of problems.  New radiotracers for assessing degree of malignancy in brain tumors by measuring functional ornithine decarboxylase activity (using 5-11C-ornithine) will be developed.  A new approach to radiotracer design, the use of 11C-labeled suicide inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) to assess functional enzyme activity initiated during this grant period will be further exploited.  The introduction of a major new thrust, the use of PET as a scientific tool in pharmaceutical research and development for new therapeutic drugs, will begin with the synthesis of positron emitter labeled drugs such as (11C) midazolam, a recently introduced benzodiazepine receptor active drug used in pre-anesthetic sedation.  Because of the growing importance of fluorine-18 for high resolution PET studies, and for measuring biological processes over a time interval of several hours, new approaches to its economical production in high yield on medical cyclotrons employing reusable solid 18O-targets and its efficient incorporation into a wide spectrum of 18F-tracers through the general synthesis of 3-(18F) fluoropropyl derivatives of biologically active compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET to address important scientific and medical issues will also be undertaken with a view to the economical supply of radiotracers from a central medical cyclotron-chemistry resource to satellite clinical PET facilities and to the pharmaceutical industry.

"NUCLEAR DNA AND MORPHOMETRIC STUDIES OF GYNECOLOGIC CANC The goals of this project are to improve our understanding of carcinogenesis in gynecologic cancers and to enhance diagnostic and prognostic accuracies using quantitative analyses.  During the past year, a close relationship between human papillomavirus infection (genital warts, condylomas) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ) has been confirmed by nuclear DNA quantitation, immunoperoxidase stain for human papillomavirus capsid antigens, and morphologic analyses.  Using these techniques, it is possible to demonstrate a transition from cervical condyloma to neoplasia.  This occurrence is supported by the coexistence of papillomavirus capsid antigens and aneuploid DNA patterns in 14% of cervical condylomatous lesions.  The risk of developing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is increased in flat rather than exophytic condylomas, and in condylomas with moderate as compared to mild degree of nuclear atypia.  These findings support the recent molecular hybridization studies indicating that several types of human papillomaviruses with different oncogenicities exist in the female genital tract.  In 51 patients with clinical stage I or II cervical adenocarcinoma, the survival is most reliably predicted by the standard deviation of nuclear size (p=0.002), the DNA ploidy level (p=0.003), the clinical stage (p=0.0072), the percentage of glandular lumen (p=0.0074), the mean nuclear size (p=0.04), and the histologic grade (p=0.09).  These findings demonstrate that the prognostic accuracies can be improved by quantitative analyses over the routine histologic examinations.

"COMPUTER RESOURCE--MOLECULAR MECHANICS AND NEURO-ANATOMY This computer resource facility is currently completing two major core projects which we believe will, during the next year, make a major contribution to the research community in general and our collaborative research in particular.  FASTRUN, an attached processor computing device for which the original design was done at the facility, is now being constructed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory as a joint project.  This processor, which is a long pipeline to compute the non-bonded pairwise forces, will be completed and delivered to Columbia within the next two months. Combined with a STAR-100 array processor, now running at the facility and a microvax as host, the system which MERCURY (Molecular Energy Refinement at Columbia University) is expected to have a computing speed somewhat greater than a CRAY-2 but only for molecular mechanics of large molecules; dynamics energy minimization, free energy of binding, etc.  The system will be used in efforts to compute the conformations of molecules whose amino acid sequence is known and are homologous to structures which have been solved crystallographically.  It will also be used to compute the ionic conductance through a protein which forms a small ion channel as the amino acid sequence of the protein is changed by site-directed mutagenesis.  The second major project is the development of a computing system for a SUN 160/3 with image processing boards for automatic extraction of cell and fiber outlines from serial section micrographs.  The system now works well enough so that it can reduce the time and tedium of manual nerve tracing by about a factor of ten.  It will be available for neuroanatomical users in the near future, and will be used initially for reconstruction of the cerebellum in developing mice in connection with experiments which study gene expression by means of in situ hybridization. The programs will be improved substantially so that the system will run for long periods without any investigator intervention. The verification and decision making which must be done by the human observer, will be carried out in one interactive process after the automatic system has operated on previously stored images.  As the hardware and the software for this system is developed, it will be available for use by many investigators both local and from other institutions.  As new hardware becomes available in the second year of the proposed grant, we expect to convert the manual CARTOS system on the LOANER, so that it can carry out automatic nerve tracing and be available to outside users.

"QUANTITATION OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR CONCENTRATION IN CELLS The objective of this project is to develop quantitative estrogen receptor concentration measurements using high resolution digital image microscopy techniques.  These techniques will enable direct measurements of receptor concentration in tissue and cells.  This is an improvement over the current biochemical assays which only give an average value for receptor concentration in a homogenized specimen sample which may contain varying proportions of malignant cells.  The assay proposed will 1) measure the concentration of receptors in cell populations, 2) the proportion of cells in a tumor population that have estrogen receptor above a certain concentration level.  The recent development of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptors makes the development of methods for immunocytochemical localization of estrogen receptors feasible.  Additional recent advances in quantitative imaging cytology can be combined with this to develop a fast, efficient and more accurate assay method and to eliminate the visual subjective components of the method. This combination of these new techniques to produce a new quantitative assay is particularly important since it has already been shown that patients whose tumors contain estrogen receptors will have a higher probability of responding to hormonal therapy, and seem to have a better prognosis than patients whose tumors do not contain this receptor.

"SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF EVOKED POTENTIALS This research seeks to increase the information obtained from noninvasive evoked potential (EP) studies by developing (1) techniques which separate the contributions of temporally overlapping generators from the surface-recorded data, and (2) improved models for the volume conduction mechanisms which relate generator location to surface topography.  These techniques will be applied to analysis of human short-latency auditory EPs and subcortical and cortical somatosensory EPs to median and peroneal nerve stimulation.  Human EPs recorded intracranially during neurosurgery will be used for verification and optimization of the models and techniques.  Estimated generator waveforms will be defined by principal component analysis of surface topographic mappings with rotation of the factors, and examined in normal subjects and in patients with neurologic disease.  In the patient group, the sensitivity of the test and its ability to localize areas of dysfunction will be compared to those of conventionally interpreted EPs.  The volume conduction processes by which the surface potentials are derived from activity in distant generators will be examined through a numeric or finite-differences computer model.  Such a model takes into account the anatomy of conductance inhomogeneities within the head, and should more accurately represent volume conduction of human EPs than models assuming spherical symmetry.  The ""forward"" volume conduction model defines the surface distribution produced by a hypothetical array of generators; the ""inverse"" problem will be approached by heurisitically modifying the generator hypotheses to obtain the best fit between the predicted surface topography and the empirical data.  The techniques developed in the course of these studies of specific EPs are also applicable to the analysis of surface- recorded event-related potentials produced by various other stimuli and by cognitive and motor tasks.  Thus, they will increase both clinical accuracy and experimental utility of many types of event-related potentials.

"CAD/CAM FOR DENTAL RESTORATIONS The specific aim of the activities described in this proposal is to create a CAD/CAM system capable of automating the currently practiced restoration fabrication techniques from impression through final restoration.   Methodology required for system development capitalizes on recent technologic advances in robotics, three-dimensional vision systems, stereophotogrammetry, computer graphics, and computer integrated engineering.  The restorations produced by this technique will be of equivalent or enhanced quality compared with those produced by traditional impression - lost-wax techniques. The first priority is to create a single metal crown.  The quality of crowns produced by the automated CAD/CAM systems will be determined using both analytic and clinical criteria.  The analytic criteria include measurement of marginal, interproximal, and occlusal fit; measurement of surface finish with stylus profilometers; and evaluation of product integrity through both scanning electron and dispersive x-ray analysis.  The clinical tests are based on criteria routinely used at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry and include evaluation in (1) a preclinical setting on Bureau of Standard dies and green teeth and (2) actual clinical evaluation with annual followup for at least the duration of the grant funding period to establish long-term stability and tissue response.  Complementing these activities, are two additional aims:  (1) investigations into materials and (2) system enhancement. Materials investigations includes (a) identification of the availability and feasibility of using tooth-colored materials, (b) identification of alternative materials that can be milled but historically have not been used for dental restorations because they could not be cast, and (c) alternative preparation designs that capitalize on material properties identified in step (b) above. System enhancement includes (a) adding the capability of producing partial coverage crowns, inlays, and bridges; (b) developing a clinically usable high-precision customized machining system; and (c) optimizing data acquisition and image processing.  A CAD/CAM system for dental restorations offers a number of potential advantages including opening the possibility of new, stronger materials and the opportunity of creating the equivalent of cast restorations in a single appointment, eliminating the potential of tissue involvement caused by temporary crowns.

"METHODOLOGY FOR CONDUCTING TMJ IMAGING STUDIES USING MRI Accurate evaluation of the temporomandibular joint is essential for the differential diagnosis of facial pain patients.  A comprehensive evaluation of the temporomandibular joint would ideally provide information regarding the integrity of both hard and soft tissue components.  Hard tissue information is obtained from traditional radiographic techniques, while magnetic resonance imaging has the capability to provide the necessary soft tissue information.  However, a standardized methodology does not yet exist to optimally acquire, process and interpret magnetic resonance images of the temporomandibular joint.  With this in mind, a research program is proposed to develop the foundations of a methodology by optimizing magnetic resonance imaging system parameters and subsequently implementing image processing techniques to further aid in localizing and characterizing certain anatomical structures in the temporomandibular joint.  The results of this research will therefore make a valuable contribution towards differential diagnosis of a complex health care problem.  This interdisciplinary research, which combines emerging technologies in medical diagnostics, computer engineering and image understanding, will be carried out by a unique collaboration between dental researchers, radiologists, and engineers.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"DISCRETE VS. CONTINUOS MODELS OF VISUAL PERCEPTION Two very different types of models of visual perception have been used by researchers in the fields of cognitive psychology and human information processing.  Discrete models characterized visual perception as a discrete operation that must completely finish processing a stimulus before any further cognitive processes receive information about that stimulus (e.g., Sternberg, 1969a). Continuous models characterize it as a continuous operation that gradually transmits information about a stimulus to later cognitive processes, so that these processes can begin before perception is finished (e.g., McClelland, 1979).  It is important for both theoretical and methodological reasons to be able to discriminate between these two types of models, and the goal of the proposed research is to develop experimental tests that can choose between them.  The proposed experiments emphasize two lines of research.  One set of experiments will use psychophysiological measurements to look for evidence that some response preparation has occurred before stimulus perception has finished.  Previous studies have sought evidence of such preliminary response preparation using indirect measures based on total response latency, and results have been subject to alternative explanations.  Using electrophysiological measures including the electromyogram (EMG) and event-related cerebral potentials (ERPs), it should be possible to measure preliminary response preparation more directly.  These measures will be obtained in several different experimental paradigms yielding effects previously attributed to preliminary response preparation, and they will indicate whether such preparation is actually responsible for these effects.  Such preliminary response preparation would be consistent with continuous, but not discrete, models of perceptual processes.  The second set of experiments will use reaction time measurements to study visual attention.  If it can be established that attentional emphasis continuously modulates the output of perceptual processes (rather than their use by late processes), then this would constitute broad support for models with continuous rather than discrete activation of stimulus codes.  The results of these studies will be of interest to cognitive psychologists, human factors engineers and designers of interfaces for human/computer interaction, and researchers in some areas of artificial intelligence.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION The characterization of the structure of a biomolecule on the its  chemical and spectral properties is of widespread importance in the biomedical sciences.  Because of its complexity, structure characterization is overall a time-consuming activity that has been largely left to experts in the field.  The goal of this research is to substantially increase the productivity of those experts.  Given the expert's proficiency in readily picking out the correct structure of an unknown from among a limited number of alternative structures, a much more expeditious assignment of structure would be achieved if the expert could begin the structure characterization problem with such a conceptually manageable number of plausible alternatives.  Thus, the goal of the research is to create artificial intelligence based computer software capable of directly reducing the collective spectral properties (infrared, proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet and mass spectral data) of the unknown to a conceptually manageable number of stereochemically defined structures, each of which is compatible with the observed spectral data.  The expert is still a required player, but is spared what is actually the time-intensive component of the ""manual"" process, that of producing the limited number of alternatives.  Key features of the software to be created include, (1) programs for both spectrum interpretation and structure generation, (2) provision to accept any structural information known to the expert and (3) the capability to treat real-world structure characterization problems without regard to the class of structures to which the unknown belongs.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

The main scientific goal of the Center is to understand how a complex biological system containing very many degrees of freedom (e.g. neurons, muscles, vascular processes) generates ordered behavior or macroscopic, spatiotemporal patterns.  This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.

"A PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE The Heart Failure Program project is a resource-related research program to develop new reasoning methods for the application of Artifical Intelligence techniques to medicine for the effort of the SUMEX-AIM community.  The context and driving force for this research is the management of heart failure in the intensive care setting.  We will:  1) Develop a representational methodology capable of supporting the clinically relevant distinctions of patient state.  This representation will utilize the clinically significant qualitative parameter values and will include causal relationships, time dependencies and relations about change.  2) Build a qualitative physiological model of the cardiovascular system using this methodology to act as a store for evolving knowledge of patient state.  3) Explore and develop strategies for determining the appropriate parameter values in the model from input data, reasoning support methods and heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic reasoning with the model, and reasoning support methods and heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic reasoning with the model, and reasoning support methods and heuristics for finding possible therapies and determining their potential consequences. 4) Build around this core a program to assist the physician in exploring his or her understanding of the implications in an individual case.

"GENETIC DATABASES--APPLICATIONS FOR MACHINE LEARNING Recent advances in neural network theory, in which the present authors have played a significant role, have resulted in machine learning algorithms of great power.  In an initial investigation, the authors have applied these algorithms to detecting and exploiting pattern regularities in DNA and also in amino acid sequences.  In the two situations considered thus far (determination of whether or not a fragment of DNA codes for a protein, and predicting protein secondary structure given amino acid sequence) the results of the neural net analysis technique equals or exceeds results of conventional methods.  We propose to intensively investigate these two problems with the goal of verifying and expanding our initial results, particularly to DNA sequences of other species, especially humans.  We plan to expand our investigations to include pattern recognition searches for promoter/terminator sequences, intron/exon splice junctions, and other regulatory signals.  Methods for the sequence to structure problem will be extended to include new results in energy minimization techniques for analogue models that contain numerous local minima.  Different network architectures and different representations for the data will be investigated.  When a neural net method exceeds a conventional method in accuracy we plan to analyze the network connections with the goal of understanding what rules the network developed (by virtue of the learning algorithm) that yielded the increased accuracy.  Other machine learning algorithms, such as ""classifier systems,"" will also be applied, as well as new approaches to information theoretic constructions of default hierarchies.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DYNAMIC DIGITAL CHEST IMAGING TECHNIQUES The goal of the proposed research is to develop new dynamic chest imaging techniques based on a digital radiographic system that has a large image intensifier (57-cm)-TV system as the x-ray detector.  The new techniques are distinctly different from existing chest imaging techniques in that they utilize the unique physical characteristcs of the digital system; a large area detector, effective scatter rejection, rapid image acquisition, and computerized image processing.  These methods have the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy for detection of pulmonary diseases at reduced patient exposure and risk, as well as at a reduced cost.  The specific aims of this research include:  (1) studies of pulmonary ventilation with non-radioactive xenon gas as the contrast medium, and (2) detection of pulmonary embolism by digital subtraction radiography with or without contrast injection.  The application of dynamic digital techniques to chest radiography can provide quantitative and dynamic data for evaluation of pulmonary ventilation and pulmonary embolism.  Initially, the basic imaging parameters of dynamic chest imaging will be optimized by using Monte Carlo simulation studies based on patient dose, detective quantum efficiency of the image intensifier, contrast sensitivity, and antiscatter techniques.  A beam equalizing filter device will be developed for reducing the dynamic range of the chest radiographs. Secondly, phantom studies will be applied to determine the imaging characteristics of the new techniques.  Thirdly, computer algorithms will be developed for quantitative analysis of the dynamic information recorded in the images.  Finally, preliminary clinical studies will be performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the dynamic imaging techniques.

"STRUCTURAL PATTERN ANALYSIS OF HUMAN G-BANDED CHROMOSOME This is a proposal to study structural pattern analysis of human G- banded chromosomes by computer.  A database of approximately 7,000 digitized images of band-density profiles is available; each type is represented by about the same number of samples.  A mapped of the density profiles into finite strings of symbols will be developed to cast the problem as string/sequence structure analysis.  A specific mapping to be evaluated carefully is based on ""difference symbol"" strings; this mapping is simple to compute and should facilitate automatic machine learning (inference) of pattern structure from training samples.  For each chromosome type, a set of training strings will be used to infer a Markov chain as a statistical/structural model.  The inference algorithm will use dynamic programming with a relative frequency cost function to compute optimal string alignments sequentially as a search for recurrent substring patterns call ""landmark substrings"".  The inferred Markov networks will be analyzed themselves for ensemble properties of the training data and will be used in classification experiments with both the training data and separate test data.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.  With the established measures and model, we will scan the GenBank database for anomalously curved regions, and determine whether or not they are correlated with the functional roles of coincident or neighboring sequences.

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR AUGMENTATIVE COMMUNICATION Expert systems offer many advantages to a variety of problem- solving endeavors.  These advantages may, in particular, increase the ability of health care professionals to deliver services by assisting in the prescription of appropriate devices or treatments. Specifically, this project addresses the feasibility of developing an expert system to assist in prescribing electronic augmentative communication devices.  The typical device prescription may be less than adequate due to three factors:  (1) the rather large population of nonspeaking individuals in the United States (approximately one million), (2) the relatively small number of centers providing comprehensive augmentative communication services, and (3) the rapidly expanding commercial market (approximately $10 million annually).  The proposed system will model a team approach to augmentative communication device prescription and include all areas of device characteristics (selection technique, language requirements, output modes, and portability) and of client capabilities and needs (communication, cognitive, motor, sensory, and social).  The system will demonstrate the specific advantages of the expert systems approach, including storage and dissemination of expertise, use of heuristic knowledge, modifiability, and query capabilities for explanation and justification of recommendation.  The system will be evaluated using case information from published and unpublished sources (some in-house).  A small-sector prototype of this expert system demonstrated that the project could be completed but a system which utilizes all information about devices and about nonspeaking persons has not been built.  Development of the proposed system will require all aspects of knowledge engineering (expert systems programming), including knowledge representation form, knowledge acquisition, and user interface issues, through all stages of expert system building.

"QUANTIFYING NITROARENE GENOTOXICITY IN COMPLEX MIXTURES The biological activity of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroarenes) has ben the subject of extensive study primarily because of the potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some nitroarenes as well as their widespread occurrence in the environment, principally as the result of incomplete combustion processes.  However, most of us are not exposed primarily to individual compounds but rather to complex mixtures both outdoors (emissions from automobiles, power plants, etc.) and indoors (cigarette smoke, heaters, stoves, ovens etc).  The objective of the work proposed in this application is to relate the genotoxic and carcinogenic activities of individual nitroarenes to activities of artificial mixtures and extracts of emission particulates in order to use data for single chemicals to evaluate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures.  The proposed project, which employs both computerized and experimental methodologies, will involve professionals with expertise in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, artificial intelligence and risk assessment, and with extensive experience in the study of nitroarenes.  Two computerized techniques will be used.  First, Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (CASE), an artificial intelligence program which was developed to predict the mutagenicity of nitroarenes, will be used to identify structural determinants of mutagenicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Second, the Carcinogenicity Prediction and Battery Selection (CPBS) method will used to identify appropriate batteries of short-term tests for screening individual nitroarenes and mixtures and to predict potential carcinogenicity, including carcinogenic potency.  Experimental studies will be directed towards assessing the activities of compounds in mixtures.  Artificial mixtures of pairs of nitroarenes or related compounds, as well as extracts of combustion emissions combined with individual chemicals, will be tested for mutagenicity, metabolic activation and deactivation of mutagenicity, mammalian genotoxicity and metabolic biotransformation.  Three issues will be addressed:  whether activities are additive or are influenced by competition for enzymatic activation, whether inactivating structures identified by CASE represent alternative biotransformation or competition and how the presence of a complex mixture influences the metabolism, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of individual chemicals.  Resolving these questions about the extrapolation from individual components to mixtures would allow data for individual chemicals concerning bioavailability, metabolism, genotoxicity, detoxification and excretion to be used to reduce uncertainty in the assessment of human risk from exposure in incomplete combustion products and other complex mixtures.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation.

"METHOD FOR FEATURE ANALYSIS IN MEDICAL IMAGING Research will be undertaken with the long-term objective of improving the means by which the performance of imaging technologies is assessed.  The increased complexity and the dynamic nature of the medical imaging field--in particular, the proliferation of CT scans and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging--make especially apparent now the need for improved measures of assessment.  Such improved measures can be expected to lead to more appropriate use of those technologies.  The proposed project has two overall aims:  first, the develop improved methods of assessing diagnostic accuracy; and second, to test and demonstrate these methods with three imaging technologies, as used with a single organ and disease--i.e. mammography, thermography, and diaphanography in the diagnosis of breast cancer.  A methodology will be developed for defining the perceptual features of an image or set or images that are of diagnostic importance, and for determining the optimal combination of these features in a diagnostic judgment.  This methodology will further include techniques for training image interpreters to use the features according to the optimal prescription as well as computer-based decision aids to reinforce the optimal behavior in routine practice.  A fundamental idea is that measures of accuracy, which underlie measures of utility, should reflect the best, practically attainable, performance of the technology.  The proposed methodology elicits information about perceptual features from experts in a technology and diagnostic problem by means of structured interviews and group discussions.  It corroborates and refines the main features by mathematical techniques of multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering as based on similarity judgments of pairs of images.  Discriminant analysis is used to establish a final set of features and their optimal weights.  A computer classifier is developed to accept interpreters' ratings of the features and to issue a probability estimate for the diagnosis under consideration.  Preliminary studies, based on mammographic images, indicate that this methodology can produce a very substantial gain in diagnostic accuracy.  The product of this project will be a publication clearly describing the new methodology, so that it can be generally applied by clinical investigators in technology assessment.  Further, the empirical comparison of the accuracies of three technologies, and the determination of their accuracy in various combinations, will be of immediate import for the medical community.

"ROLE OF Z BAND IN CARDIAC SARCOMERE In heart muscle cells, the contractile units must be linked by Z bands for effective contraction.  The Z band is a complex protein lattice which is an integral part of the contractile apparatus, but its exact role in contraction is not known.  Z bands vary in width in normal and diseased muscles, but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods, we have identified a common structural unit in Z bands of mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle.  Our optical reconstruction studies show a regular arrangement of axial and cross connecting filaments.  However, the Z band is rarely a uniform lattice, because there is variation in the arrangement of cross connecting filaments.  Two different lattice forms, basket weave and small square are observed and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure capable of responding to different physiological states of the muscle.  Our purpose in these studies is to examine structural differences in the Z band lattice between cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, between slow and fast skeletal muscle, between adult and developing muscle, between normal and diseased muscle and to correlate them with specific structural states induced experimentally.  We will generate a three dimensional reconstruction of the Z band by computerized image processing of a tilt series of electron micrographs.  Then we can determine the impact of specific rearrangements within the lattice in different muscle types in different physiological states.  Using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, we will examine Z bands 1) in normal muscles fixed or frozen before, during, and after tetanic contraction; 2) in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3) in isolated myofibrils; and 4) in postnatally developing intact muscle.  A systematic analysis will be used to answer two questions.  Why does the lattice move?  How is the Z band formed?  The emphasis will be on the three dimensional structure of the Z band lattice.  New information about Z bands structure will help us to understand the significance of widened Z bands in developing muscle and in diseased muscle and may suggest a mechanism for the formation and breakdown of the Z bands.

"QUANTITATIVE REGIONAL CURVATURE ANALYSIS Artificial intelligence and machine vision systems often use shape analysis as a fundamental approach to characterization of complex objects and motion.  Such concepts have been used to advantage in industry but have not been extensively exploited for cardiac diagnosis.  Aims:  (1) To develop a method of quantitative regional function analysis based on analysis of dynamics of ventricular shape that will replace traditional methods used to assess wall motion so that assumptions regarding coordinate, reference and indexing systems, geometry of the ventricle and uniformity of its contraction pattern can be abandoned.  (2) To quantify the regional shape of the normal right and left ventricles and establish the patterns of shape abnormality seen in the setting of coronary artery disease.  (3) To establish the relationship between regional shape and regional function.  (4) To develop a clinically useable, automated method for ventricular feature extraction and determine its usefulness in predicting the presence and location of coronary disease by analysis of ventricular images obtained during an ischemic stress.  (5) To assess the prognostic significance of regional shape analysis.  (6) To automate the requisite edge detection by using integrative methods of artificial intelligence.  The hypothesis is that the normal ventricle has a characteristic shape and rate of shape change throughout the phases of the cardiac cycle and that abnormal ventricles have abnormal shapes and shape changes by virtue of abnormalities of function.  Therefore, quantitation of abnormalities of shape parameters will provide an indirect measure of ventricular dysfunction.  This will be determined by frame-by-frame curvature analysis of cineventriculograms in patients with normal and stenotic coronary arteries.  Animal studies will compare results of regional thickening and thinning determined by implanted sonomicrometers with shape changes assessed from simultaneous contrast ventriculograms and ventricular outlines determined from implanted subendocardial lead pellets.  The success of this approach will allow abandonment of numerous controversial assumptions mandated by traditional approaches and will solve a long-standing problem in cardiology.  The concepts to be explored will provide new and unique information of potential prognastic importance and it will advance the neglected field of computer vision in the study of non-rigid bodies in motion.

"A MOUSE MODEL FOR CHRONIC ORAL ALUMINUM TOXICITY Systemic aluminum produces encephalopathy and osteomalacia in humans, but environmental toxicity has been considered minimal because of low oral bioavailability.  However, in pilot work we have demonstrated neurotoxicity in lactating mice fed diets containing 500ppm aluminum, one order of magnitude above human exposure levels.  In addition, developmental toxicity including growth retardation, developmental delay and depressed immune function was seen in offspring.  In the proposed experiments, we have hypothesized that interaction with essential trace element metabolism leads to enhanced susceptibility to oral aluminum toxicity during developmental periods.  The experiments include studies of vulnerable periods, dose-response relationships, maternal-fetal transfer, interaction with trace metal deficient diets and definition of ""no observable adverse effect"" levels.  Swiss-Webster mice will be fed purified diets with precisely controlled levels of essential trace metals and supplemented with aluminum lactate at levels of 100, 500 or 1000 ppm elemental aluminum.  Diets will be fed for a six week period to nonpregnant, pregnant or lactating female mice.  The design includes pair fed controls.  Dams will be evaluated for neurotoxicity (functional signs and neurohistopathology), immunotoxicity and tissue concentrations of essential trace metals (Zn, Cu, Mg, Fe, Ca) and aluminum.  Offspring will also be evaluated for tissue trace metal levels as well as growth, developmental delay and behavioral and immune function.

"SELF-TRAINING, SELF-OPTIMIZING INFRARED EXPERT SYSTEM With the advent of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) instrumentation, IR techniques have seen increasing application in the area of environmental analysis.  Environmental analysis applications of FTIR include the characterization of hazardous waste mixtures and the speciation and quantitation of airborne vapors and gases both in ambient air, vehicular emissions and the workplace.  The most commonly applied method of spectral identification uses forward searching of infrared spectral libraries.  This method succeeds where the compound and the resulting spectrum is pure, or where the spectrum of a commercial mixture is available.  The method fails in the case of the spectra of mixtures that are not stored as mixtures in the library.  Methods of identifying the compounds in the spectra of mixtures, especially in environmental mixtures, have been pioneered by our group, based on the work of Woodruff, et al, and Herget, et al.  This approach was achieved through the use of a three level rule structure for each peak, giving increasing ""goodness"" scores for each peak in successively narrower frequency windows.  At the heart of the programs that are used to accomplish either compound or compound class identification are PAIRS and PAWMI.  This proposal is aimed at research that will enable these programs to self-train and self- optimize.  Specifically, the hypothesis is:  A self-training, self-optimizing expert system can be developed to identify the components of mixtures of environmental significance using infrared spectrocopy.  1.  Optimization of weighting factors for peak goodness based on frequency of occurrence of peaks in each wavenumber window for given training sets. 2.  Optimization of peak window widths for rules containing three peak position windows for each expected absorption. 3.  Incorporation of a program to deconvove overlapping peaks. 4.  Incorporation of the automated rule generator, the automated rule optimizer, the deconvolution and peak picking programs, and the mixture interpretation program into one expert system applicable to both condensed and vapor phase species.  Each of the above specific aims involves basic research into the use of expert systems for spectroscopic analysis.  This research will be conducted using appropriate training sets of environmental significance.

"APPLICATION OF EVIDENTIAL REASONING IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS A proposal for developing a medical expert system shell for application in various areas of medicine (internal medicine, laboratory medicine, psychology, etc.) that is based on a new method for evidential reasoning-is advanced.  This system can be applied as: (1) a screening system for detecting risk patients in the hospital, the out-patient department, and the practitioner's office (2) a laboratory diagnostic system for automatically generating laboratory reports with diagnostic summaries, and (3) a sophisticated medical consultation system for differential diagnosis.  Through the newly developed evidential reasoning method that is based on Dempster-Shafer Theory of evidence, an adequate representation of medical entities and relationships between them is possible.  Specifically, this method allows us to capture the uncertainty in the definition of disease, symptoms, laboratory test results, and in their mutual association.

"SIMULATION MODELING OF THE IMMUNE SYSTEM NO universally accepted model of the immune system exists, therefore no substantial model of the diseased states of man exists either.  Man's diseases--cancer, auto immunity (arthritis), severe allergies and recently AIDS, all involve the immune system and would benefit from having a defined model of the diseased state. Transplantation of cells and tissues and immunosuppressive drug therapy both would gain a giant step forward if a simulation model of the immune system were available. This application will test the feasibility of building such a model, exploring available systems and methods for effectively building an Immune System Simulation Model.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC IMAGE INTERPRETATION The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinically useful, computer-based methodology to assist in decision-making tasks in medical imaging.  The methodology consists of a novel approach combining well-established mathematical methods and artificial intelligence techniques for simultaneously representing medical knowledge and handling visual information.  The specific aims of the proposed research are to develop, implement, test, and validate a knowledge-based system for interpreting three-dimensional thallium-201 myocardial distributions obtained by tomographic imaging.  These interpretations will assist clinicians in detecting and localizing coronary artery disease.  The research will be carried out in a collaboration between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, thus providing a unique, interdisciplinary, and interinstitutional approach that directs complementary clinical and scientific resources toward this important medical problem. The five-year research program consists of four projects, dealing with (1) knowledge representation, (2) image understanding, (3) clinical acceptance and validation, and (4) system extension and refinement.  Preliminary studies indicate that the methodology can provide both accurate cardiac image interpretations and graphical, computer-generated representations of arterial structure.  The approach can serve as a clinically useful model with applications to other imaging modalities, and can also be used as a tool for tutoring and training clinicians.  The knowledge-based system is designed to be sufficiently extensible and flexible to accommodate the far-term objectives of eventually providing decision-making support to clinicians in tasks associated with diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis.

"COMPUTER CONSULTANT FOR OPTIMAL NMR IMAGING Medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new expensive imaging modality which avoids ionizing radiation and provides excellent diagnostic images.  The images produced depend on both the properties of the patient's tissues and the radiologist controlled parameters of the MRI scanner.  When scanner parameters are selected with clearcut objectives accounting for the patients's history, anatomic relationships and the MR properties of relevant tissues, accurate diagnostic images result. There are expert MRI radiologists who understand these tradeoffs, and use heuristic reasoning to simplify the mathematical and clinical complexity.  Their expertise can be encoded into a knowledge-based expert computer system.  Specifically, we propose to accomplish the following research:  1. Using existing methods of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, construct a first prototype expert system. It will be designed to incorporate the following functionality: o  Be a useful consultant for twenty representative situations involving the anatomy of the head, such as multiple sclerorsis, acoustic neuroma and pituitary adenoma. o  In a given clinical setting, produce a set of MR imaging parameters optimal for determining if a specific disease process is present. o  Be able to explain its reasoning in terms comprehensible to radiologists.  2.  Explore different inference strategies for reasoning about complex MRI physics interactions, such as constraint algorithms and mixed forward/backward chaining approaches.  3.  Build a user interface uniquely suited to the needs of radiologists engaged in MR imaging.  4.  Expand the knowledge of the prototype by incorporating changes in MR imaging technology and gradually including more anatomical regions.  5.

"PHYSIOLOGIC KNOWLEDGE--ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS It has been recognized that one of the limitations of the ""first generation"" of medical artificial intelligence systems was the phenomenological nature of the knowledge to which they had access.  To perform effectively in difficult diagnostic and therapeutic situations, such programs will need knowledge bases which are sufficiently rich to enable them to reason about pathophysiological mechanisms.  Thus, the representation of the domain knowledge of physiology is becoming an important part of the development of such systems.  In this research, several problems inherent in representing and reasoning about complex physiological knowledge will be investigated in the context of developing a medical knowledge base and building a module which uses physiological reasoning to aid in evaluating diagnostic hypotheses and therapeutic plans.  The module will have access to a knowledge base which contains the domain knowledge of a subset of renal basic physiology, as well as clinical knowledge about fluid and electrolyte disturbances.  Its performance will be evaluated by integration into a system with components which generate diagnostic hypotheses, therapy plans, and explanations of the system's reasoning and output.  The following issues will be explored:  a. qualitative vs. quantitative representation of parameter values and qualitative reasoning or simulation vs. numerical calculation; b. temporal representation and reasoning; c. classification of causal mechanisms, with emphasis on concepts specific to the domain of physiology.  The above issues are relevant to the field of knowledge representation at large.  Thus, the proposed investigation may lead to the development of knowledge representation and reasoning techniques which are particularly adapted to the domain of renal physiology but may have wider applicability as well.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED RADIOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of the radiologist as he/she interprets x-ray examinations.  Two computer-based approaches to this goal will be studied.  First a computer-generated, patient-specific consult will be made availabe to the radiologist at the time he reads the x-ray.  It will consist of a brief clinical summary whose elements are chosen for their information content, a differential diagnostic list containing the patients 1 to 5 most likely diseases, and a list of prompts indicating those abnormal x-ray findings that would contribute the most to diagnosing the patient.  The second technique investigated will be a computer-managed, continuous audit that will use the discharge diagnoses of each patient to help determine the average accuracy of the x-ray interpretations.  This mechanism can provide feedback to the individual radiologists concerning the specific diseases and findings for which their readings are suboptimal.  Evaluation will be through comparison of the chest x-ray interpretations generated with and without the consult/prompt system.  Two approaches will be used.  The first will compare all examinations from a 12-month period before implementation with those from a similar period after implementation.  The second will assess the difference in interpretations on 200 select chest x- rays interpreted by six physicians with and without the consult and prompts.  For this test, an expert panel will determine the actual abnormalities present.  The collected interpretations of the 200 films will be used to test the audit system to determine whether its results conform with the results of traditional measures of performance based on rereading multiple x-rays.  The applications created during this project will use the expert system tools in the HELP system combined with a group of knowledge management routines.  An implicit goal of the project is to investigate the application of information theory to the problem of accuracy in the radiology department.  These tools will have general applicability in medicine.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.

"INFORMATION PROCESSING A new simultaneous experimental and theoretical interdisciplinary approach to study information processing in neuronal networks is suggested.  It combines a detailed electro-morphological study at the cellular level with mathematical analysis using a new tool for the Simulation of Neuronal Networks (SONN) which we plan to develop.  The idea is to consider neurons as a composition of subunits (e.g.,  axonal branch point), each performs specific information processing functions (Parnas and Segev, 1979).  These functional subunits are first characterized experimentally, then analyzed using detailed partial differential equations (P.D.E) models (e.g., Parnas et al., 1986 a, b, c).  Investigating these experimentally based models will eventually allow to abstract the subunits as independent processors or State Machines (S.M), which transform input to output and changes their internal states. SONN will include both P.D.E and the S.M models, the latter will serve to build a whole neuronal network and to analyze its information processing aspects in comparison to the experimental network.  We believe that this approach will help to establish a theoretical framework for connecting biophysical mechanisms to the function of the neural-network and will aid to refine and redefine models in Artificial Intelligence.  The heart ganglion of the lobster is the experimental network we plan to investigate.  The initial modeling will be done with SPICE, a general-purpose electrical network analysis program, which we have adapted for the use of neurobiologists (Segev et al., 1985). However, its limitations and the realization that an appropriate modeling tool is crucial for our purposes, prompted us to propose to develop SONN for performing ""on line"" theoretical experiments.  The emphasis is on developing graphical and mathematical tools to visualize the morphology and the electrical behavior of the modeled system using color codes.  We believe this approach will lead to a better understanding of the principles that underlie the function of neuronal networks.

"DIGITAL VIEWING STATIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES The arrival of high speed digital electronic communication in radiological sciences is gradually changing the method of acquiring, communicating, storing, and viewing diagnostic images. One natural development due to this change is the emergence of the digital radiology department.  In the previous study we demonstrated the feasibility of such a development by designing and implementing two clinical multiple digital viewing stations in the Pediatric Radiology Section.  During this study related technological problems which had hindered such development were also solved.  They were:  (1) the conversion of conventional radiographic images into high resolution digital images by using a laser film scanner and a computed radiographic system, (2) development of a digital optical disk storage system for mass image storage, and (3) the installation of a broadband communication system for rapid networking of images.  The purpose of this research proposal is to continue this development and to have a complete digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section in the Radiological Sciences Department within five years.  This digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section includes patient registration, image acquisition, mass storage, network communication, and image viewing.  The first two years will be used for the integration of various components into a total digital viewing system and to gain clinical acceptance.  The third year will be for clinical trials of the complete digital-based operation.  The fourth year will be for phasing out of the film- based operation and extending the digital viewing system capabilities to the pediatric department and to the genitourinary radiology section.  The last year will be used for clinical evaluations and planning of the total digital viewing system for the entire department.  It is anticipated that this project will become a success because we have met all the technological requirements as well as have considered and studied the psychological implications of a digital review system.  The importance of building and evaluating such a digital viewing system as an alternate method for the current film-based operation is obvious since a successful execution of the current project will change the direction of viewing radiological images in the future.

The proposed work would attempt to consolidate the wide range of approaches to such activities, by undertaking to treat the genome as language, bringing to bear the tools of computational linguistics to established a formal basis for describing genetic information.  This will be done using the formalism of logic grammars (or Definite Clause Grammars), and extensible, Prolog- based system for specifying languages of greater than context- free power.  This will extend DNA search capabilities well beyond the known limitations of current regular expression search programs, and should in addition subsume many specialized programs, because of the increased linguistic power available. The unified conceptual framework provided by such a system would provide a clear, hierarchical presentation of varying levels of abstraction on the genome, presenting the opportunity for (1) specifying searches for more sophisticated genetic elements over large sequence databases (such as those likely to be produced by the Human Genome Sequencing Project); (2) an interactive system for adjusting definitions of such elements to account for data; and (3) the foundation for an experiment-planning system based on a procedural interpretation of the declarative grammar.  To achieve these goals, it will be necessary to address issues of computational efficiency and systematic extensions in linguistic power, making use of current approaches to parsing and natural language processing.

"SYSTEMATIC DESIGN ENGINEERING CONTROL FOR ROBOTIC Because of the versatility and programmability of robots, workers most probably are not aware of the hazards of a particular robot configuration.  An effective traditional approach to achieve robotic safety utilizes mechanical means, such as mechanical stops and mechanical guarding devices.  However, this approach provides limited protection for personnel, hardware and/or the robot because of personnel's lack of understanding of the system software.  The proposed study is to develop an engineering control system for the robotic system.  This control system development has three phases:  Phase I-- will develop a systematic procedure and safety guideline for the planning stage of robot use; Phase II -- will construct a physical robot safety system model that incorporates the safety devices into the developed safety procedure and Phase III -- will design an intelligent monitoring software for the robot system safety.  In other words, the safety requirements in planning, installing and operating a robotic system are studied. The guideline in each application stage is developed with the construction of a demonstration model.  Emphasis is on the use of an engineering control approach in robotic system safety.  The study results can be applied to existing robots as an evaluation tool and to future robotic systems as a design guideline, thereby making the developed control system particularly useful for anticipating and avoiding safety hazards.

"PHYSICIAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION USING GRAPHICS AND SPEECH Recent advances in speech-recognition technology have made spoken language a viable interface medium for human-computer communication, promising increased acceptance of medical computer systems by physicians and other health workers. However, speech recognition techniques have not yet advanced to the point where understanding of unconstrained speech is possible. We accordingly propose a staged research plan to study the way computer graphics can be bused to constrain the possible meanings of an utterance, thereby promoting physician-computer communication that is both effective and practical.  We will create a prototype speech-and-graphics interface to ONCOCIN, a medical advice system previously developed in our laboratory.  We will use this prototype in experiments to discover how we might expand the interaction language to support more fully the kinds of phrases physicians would want to speak to ONCOCIN's graphical datasheet.  The results of these experiments will be used to extend the number and kind of phrases the ONCOCIN interface can accept.  We will then explore the use of graphics to constrain the task of speech-recognition of limited dictated text.  Using the same techniques employed for the graphical datasheet, we will design a structured progress note for reporting the status of cancer patients and implement it as a graphical interface.  In a parallel endeavor, we will perform experiments to study the language used in creating progress notes by simulating a graphical progress note entry system.  The research we propose benefits from our use of ONCOCIN, a medical expert system that already has a sophisticated graphical interface and is in limited clinical use.  The research gains additional impetus from our collaboration with Speech Systems incorporated, a company that is providing us with advanced speech-recognition technology.

"INDEXING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION The goal of this proposal is to develop an expert system for archiving medical information.  The main feature of the system will be the ability to automatically index medical text with keywords.  Input to the system will consist of reports from medical charts, abstracts from the medical literature, and descriptive passages from teaching collections.  The system will retrieve information through requests formulated in natural language, or through Boolean combinations of keywords.   The knowledge base for the expert system will be a semantic network generated from thesauri of medical terms.  The expert system shell; the natural language and Boolean retrieval routines and utilities for thesaurus construction have already been developed. Partial thesauri containing an average of 3,000 terms and 15,000 links have been constructed for neuropathology, neuroradiology, and psychiatry.  These thesauri have been successfully tested in pilot studies of automated indexing and natural language retrieval.  During the course of this project we will complete these thesauri and compare the performance of the full autoindexing system to human indexers.  If these tests are successful, we will extend thesaurus construction to neurology and neurosurgery developing a merged thesaurus covering the clinical neurosciences.  The expert system will then be integrated into a comprehensive medical information system under development at the University of Pittsburgh.

"CONTEXT INFORMATION IN AUTOMATED CERVICAL SMEAR ANALYSIS The overall aim of this project is to improve automated cervical smear image analysis techniques sufficiently to:  1) routinely provide additional diagnostic information to supplement that provided by human visual examination, and 2) provide accurate, cost effective prescreening capabilities.  By furnishing additional quantitative diagnostic information, such automated systems would permit the practicing cytopathologist to make more accurate and refined diagnostic judgements, which would lead to improved patient management.  By providing a practical prescreening capability, such systems would increase the efficiency and efficacy of health care delivery.  Current automated cervical smear analysis research employs only the analysis of isolated cells, and practical automated analysis is not yet a reality.  The primary contribution of this project will be the completion of development and testing of image analysis techniques that extract information from cells and other objects as seen in the context of the ""background"" of the smear.  Specifically, cells, cell clusters, bare nuclei, and cytoplasmic fragments are analyzed and the resulting contextual features, slide-averaged ""features"" and high-resolution features describing single cells are combined to produce a more complete and accurate description of the smear.  This description will provide information not obtainable by human visual analysis, which can be used, 1) directly, to ascertain diagnostic clues, and 2) indirectly to make accurate prescreening possible.  An extensive pilot study has shown that the contextual analysis provides complementary information to that provided by single cell analysis.  That is, where single cell analysis seems to have difficulty, contextual analysis is most accurate - and vice versa. Thus we expect to demonstrate that the combination of our contextual analysis techniques with single cell analysis will give automated Pap smear analysis the additional screening accuracy that is needed.

"COMPUTER-BASED RESPIRATORY SUPPORT CONSULTANT The aggressive respiratory management protocols used in testing infants suffering from acute hyaline membrane disease (HMD) involves maintaining a delicate balance between meeting the infant's respiratory needs and avoiding the devastating long-term consequences of excessive airway pressures and oxygen.  Systematic use of all the knowledge affecting ventilator therapy decisions will improve the quality of care, particularly during periods when the most experienced clinicians are not present.  The objective of this project is to design and implement a computer-based system which will aid clinicians in providing appropriate respiratory support for infants suffering acute HMD.  The system will build on our previously developed computer-based HMD course and management model. Knowledge of treatment protocols and the therapeutic and diagnostic states under which each protocol operates will be derived from our current clinical practices.  This knowledge will be expressed as treatment and diagnostic rules and incorporated in a small knowledge-based system written in Turbo Prolog and implemented on a personal computer.  Such an approach allows flexible use of qualitative physiological and clinical knowledge to an extent which is difficult to achieve with traditional programming methods.  The resulting system can be modified and expanded to extend the domain of applicability to a broader population and improve the system's predictive accuracy.  This system will use readily available data (e.g. blood gases, respirator settings, physical signs) in conjunction with diagnostic rules to maintain a list of attributes reflecting an individual baby's current physiological and treatment status.  The system will search the treatment rules for all applicable therapy changes which could correct a given blood gas abnormality, and list the alternatives along with their side effects and the applicable rationale.  It will be a valuable tool in teaching the principles of ventilator management.  All details of the patient's state and each user interaction with the system will be stored and used in evaluating system performance.  This system should enhance the consistency of respiratory support by consistently applying a large body of timely clinical knowledge to each therapeutic decision.

"STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS This proposal will focus on the use of structural biology to aid in the development of drugs that can interfere in a specific manner with protein products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome.

"CAMREAD--HIGH SPEED OPTICAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM ADA hereby proposes an IBM-AT based multi-functional system - CAMREAD. CAMREAD is an inexpensive real-time image processing system with the capability of high speed character recognition to solve the problem of converting printed documents into machine-readable records.  Different from other commercially available expensive mono-functional reading machine, the proposed system has many unique features.  First, it is a real-time image processing workstation with a variety of real-time image processing capabilities, such as real-time image arithmetic and logical processing, morphological processing, statistical processing, convolution processing, and etc.  Second, it employs four video cameras instead of the slow scanners which are used by most reading machines.  Besides their high speed capability for image acquisition, the major advantage of using video cameras is that non-planar page documents such as books, magazines and other printing medium can be read by this system.  Third, by using real- time image processing technique, CAMREAD is expected faster than any commercially available reading machines.  In Phase I, a prototype CAMREAD will be completed and 99.9% correct recognition rate with the speed of 300 characters per second for most fonts which are proportionally spaced are expected.

"SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF EVOKED POTENTIALS This research seeks to increase the information obtained from noninvasive evoked potential (EP) studies by developing (1) techniques which separate the contributions of temporally overlapping generators from the surface-recorded data, and (2) improved models for the volume conduction mechanisms which relate generator location to surface topography.  These techniques will be applied to analysis of human short-latency auditory EPs and subcortical and cortical somatosensory EPs to median and peroneal nerve stimulation.  Human EPs recorded intracranially during neurosurgery will be used for verification and optimization of the models and techniques.  Estimated generator waveforms will be defined by principal component analysis of surface topographic mappings with rotation of the factors, and examined in normal subjects and in patients with neurologic disease.  In the patient group, the sensitivity of the test and its ability to localize areas of dysfunction will be compared to those of conventionally interpreted EPs.  The volume conduction processes by which the surface potentials are derived from activity in distant generators will be examined through a numeric or finite-differences computer model.  Such a model takes into account the anatomy of conductance inhomogeneities within the head, and should more accurately represent volume conduction of human EPs than models assuming spherical symmetry.  The ""forward"" volume conduction model defines the surface distribution produced by a hypothetical array of generators; the ""inverse"" problem will be approached by heurisitically modifying the generator hypotheses to obtain the best fit between the predicted surface topography and the empirical data.  The techniques developed in the course of these studies of specific EPs are also applicable to the analysis of surface- recorded event-related potentials produced by various other stimuli and by cognitive and motor tasks.

"STRUCTURAL PATTERN ANALYSIS OF HUMAN G-BANDED CHROMOSOME This is a proposal to extend substantially a method of structural pattern analysis of human G-banded chromosomes by computer.  A database of 6985 digitized profiles of chromosomes will be used.  Individual profiles are filtered and mapped into a string representation which emphasizes band transitions.  Dynamic programming is used to compute optimal (maximum probability) string alignments, both to infer a model (a finite Markcv chain) from learning samples and to classify by chromosome type in recognition experiments.  Use of this method will be extended to more detailed analysis of structure.  In particular, automatically determining p-q vs. q-p orientation and locating the centromere will be investigated.  To increase the speed of computation, constraining the dynamic programming such that unlikely alignments are not computed and reducing the size of networks by removing nodes labelled with very low frequency of occurrence will be investigated.  To make use of higher level knowledge about the chromosome complement of human cells, the structural models will be incorporated into a knowledge-based program which uses the structural analysis together with the knowledge base for analysis at the level of individual cells.  This will be a step towards an integrated system of multilevel analysis.

"A MOUSE MODEL FOR CHRONIC ORAL ALUMINUM TOXICITY Systemic aluminum produces encephalopathy and osteomalacia in humans, but environmental toxicity has been considered minimal because of low oral bioavailability.  However, in pilot work we have demonstrated neurotoxicity in lactating mice fed diets containing 500ppm aluminum, one order of magnitude above human exposure levels.  In addition, developmental toxicity including growth retardation, developmental delay and depressed immune function was seen in offspring.  In the proposed experiments, we have hypothesized that interaction with essential trace element metabolism leads to enhanced susceptibility to oral aluminum toxicity during developmental periods.  The experiments include studies of vulnerable periods, dose-response relationships, maternal-fetal transfer, interaction with trace metal deficient diets and definition of ""no observable adverse effect"" levels.  Swiss-Webster mice will be fed purified diets with precisely controlled levels of essential trace metals and supplemented with aluminum lactate at levels of 100, 500 or 1000 ppm elemental aluminum.  Diets will be fed for a six week period to nonpregnant, pregnant or lactating female mice.  The design includes pair fed controls.  Dams will be evaluated for neurotoxicity (functional signs and neurohistopathology), immunotoxicity and tissue concentrations of essential trace metals (Zn, Cu, Mg, Fe, Ca) and aluminum.  Offspring will also be evaluated for tissue trace metal levels as well as growth, developmental delay and behavioral and immune function.  Behavior and immune function will be evaluated at weaning and again two weeks after termination of aluminum exposure to determine residual effects.  Further experiments evaluating developmental and neurotoxicity will be selected by relying on a structured decision tree format.

"ATTENTIONAL DEFICIT CHILDREN: A DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS This study will map certain dimensional aspects of personality (impulsivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking) and laboratory measures of nervous system sensitivity in 200 heterogeneous, clinically and school referred attention deficit disordered (ADD) subjects (structured interview diagnosis) and 50 controls.  Behavioral and physiological measures will be obtained during augmentation-reduction and signal detection procedures.  The primary goal is to construct a decision tree that will enhance the DSM-III diagnosis of ADD subjects in the sense of making it more predictive of clinical outcome at follow-up.  Past research of ours and others indicates that an augmentation-reduction procedure, in which the individual responds to tones of increasing intensity, differentiates hyperactive ADD children from controls and is predictive of therapeutic drug dose.  We will attempt to replicate and extend these results using signal detection techniques which would appear to be superior to augmenting procedures for purposes of studying nervous system sensitivity and attentional processes.  Russian investigators refer to sensitivity as strength.  This is assessed by them as a subject's ability to detect stimuli low in intensity and/or to withstand strong stimuli.  We extend this definition to include four hypothesized relatively independent dimensions:  sensitivity to tones low and high in intensity and sensitivity to reward and punishment.  These four laboratory measures will be correlated with dimensional aspects of personality, including impulsivity, aggressivity, anxiety-proneness, and sensation seeking.  Subjects will be grouped post hoc in several ways:  (a) on the basis of DSM-III diagnosis; (b) on the basis of DSM-III and personality attributes; (c) on the basis of DSM-III diagnoses and sensitivity indices; and (d) on the basis of DSM-III, personality, and sensitivity measures.  We hypothesize that (b), (c) and (d) will be more predictive of clinical outcome than (a).  We also expect (b) to correlate more closely with the laboratory measures of sensitivity than (a), but expect (b) and (c) to be independent predictors of outcome and to correlate about equally with outcome.  And we expect (d) to be the best predictor of outcome, particularly for children receiving methylphenidate.

"QUANTITATIVE REGIONAL CURVATURE ANALYSIS Artificial intelligence and machine vision systems often use shape analysis as a fundamental approach to characterization of complex objects and motion.  Such concepts have been used to advantage in industry but have not been extensively exploited for cardiac diagnosis.  Aims:  (1) To develop a method of quantitative regional function analysis based on analysis of dynamics of ventricular shape that will replace traditional methods used to assess wall motion so that assumptions regarding coordinate, reference and indexing systems, geometry of the ventricle and uniformity of its contraction pattern can be abandoned.  (2) To quantify the regional shape of the normal right and left ventricles and establish the patterns of shape abnormality seen in the setting of coronary artery disease.  (3) To establish the relationship between regional shape and regional function.  (4) To develop a clinically useable, automated method for ventricular feature extraction and determine its usefulness in predicting the presence and location of coronary disease by analysis of ventricular images obtained during an ischemic stress.  (5) To assess the prognostic significance of regional shape analysis.  (6) To automate the requisite edge detection by using integrative methods of artificial intelligence.  The hypothesis is that the normal ventricle has a characteristic shape and rate of shape change throughout the phases of the cardiac cycle and that abnormal ventricles have abnormal shapes and shape changes by virtue of abnormalities of function.  Therefore, quantitation of abnormalities of shape parameters will provide an indirect measure of ventricular dysfunction.  This will be determined by frame-by-frame curvature analysis of cineventriculograms in patients with normal and stenotic coronary arteries.  Animal studies will compare results of regional thickening and thinning determined by implanted sonomicrometers with shape changes assessed from simultaneous contrast ventriculograms and ventricular outlines determined from implanted subendocardial lead pellets.  The success of this approach will allow abandonment of numerous controversial assumptions mandated by traditional approaches and will solve a long-standing problem in cardiology.  The concepts to be explored will provide new and unique information of potential prognastic importance and it will advance the neglected field of computer vision in the study of non-rigid bodies in motion.

"FETAL LUNG BIOCHEMISTRY AND 3-DIMENSIONAL MICROANATOMY During late fetal development, the lung must prepare for the transition to air breathing.  Maintaining alveolar stability becomes vital for survival. Therapy with glucocorticoids to enhance lung maturity may have immediate and long term consequences for lung structure and function.  This series of investigations is directed toward furthering our basic knowledge of lung secretory cell development.  We will use structural and biochemical methods to test hypotheses of secretory cell function and to test the probabilities that glucocorticoids damage fetal and newborn lung structure.  We intend to study biochemical and 3-dimensional morphologic changes during epithelial cell maturation in the last days of fetal development.  We will test hypotheses of the assembly of lamellar bodies and assess the changes in type II cell maturation induced by glucocorticoids.  This drug induced accelerated maturation is a relevant clinical concern as the effects are widespread within the lung and have not been shown to be entirely reversible during postnatal growth.

"PROJECTING THE COSTS OF AIDS/ARC IN THE UNITED STATES The AIDS epidemic will impose substantial social, political and economic burdens on the U.S. over the foreseeable future. Many have expressed interest in discovering what the potential impact on federal and state health care budgets will be if AIDS (and AIDS-related Complex--ARC) continue unchecked.  Scientific knowledge concerning all aspects of AIDS epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment protocols is changing so rapidly that existing cost estimates need updating. Treatment protocols involving both investigational therapies and modifications in the use of AZT for AIDS patients and asymptomatic seropositive individuals are under active study. Many clinical experts think that substantial additional substitution of outpatient and home care for inpatient care can significantly lower the cost-per-case. Estimates of the infected population, the HIV viral transmission rates, the proportion of seropositive cases progressing to ARC and AIDS, and the mean length of viral incubation and disease survival are subject to almost continual revision.  In the past eight months, we have carried out a projection of AIDS and ARC illness costs (see Appendix B). The methodological approach that we took, and which we plan to refine and validate with the proposed research, was to develop AIDS/ARC lifetime cost-per-patient estimates by constructing medical diagnosis and treatment decision tree algorithms for all major AIDS/ARC medical complications. National cost estimates were then developed by combining out epidemiologic projections on HIV seroprevalence and rates of progression to AIDS and ARC with per-patient cost estimates.  The California Department of Health Services will help us to refine and extend this work by providing data from their Medi-Cal AIDS patient data base for statistical evaluation of patient care services and disease progression (see Appendix A). We intend to further validate the methodology by incorporating diagnosis/treatment modifications suggested by two physician consultants in other regions with substantial AIDS prevalence (e.g. New York and Miami or Texas) to reflect regional differences in patient mix and treatment practice.  The proposed research will place computerized spreadsheets of all model calculations in the public domain. As new information become available, we, and other researchers, will be able to easily make changes or modifications in the model.

"ROLE OF Z BAND IN CARDIAC SARCOMERE In heart muscle cells, the contractile units must be linked by Z bands for effective contraction.  The Z band is a complex protein lattice which is an integral part of the contractile apparatus, but its exact role in contraction is not known.  Z bands vary in width in normal and diseased muscles, but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods, we have identified a common structural unit in Z bands of mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle.  Our optical reconstruction studies show a regular arrangement of axial and cross connecting filaments.  However, the Z band is rarely a uniform lattice, because there is variation in the arrangement of cross connecting filaments.  Two different lattice forms, basket weave and small square are observed and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure capable of responding to different physiological states of the muscle.  Our purpose in these studies is to examine structural differences in the Z band lattice between cardiac and slow skeletal muscle, between slow and fast skeletal muscle, between adult and developing muscle, between normal and diseased muscle and to correlate them with specific structural states induced experimentally.  We will generate a three dimensional reconstruction of the Z band by computerized image processing of a tilt series of electron micrographs.  Then we can determine the impact of specific rearrangements within the lattice in different muscle types in different physiological states.  Using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, we will examine Z bands 1) in normal muscles fixed or frozen before, during, and after tetanic contraction; 2) in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3) in isolated myofibrils; and 4) in postnatally developing intact muscle.  A systematic analysis will be used to answer two questions.  Why does the lattice move?  How is the Z band formed?  The emphasis will be on the three dimensional structure of the Z band lattice.  New information about Z bands structure will help us to understand the significance of widened Z bands in developing muscle and in diseased muscle and may suggest a mechanism for the formation and breakdown of the Z bands.

"COMPUTER CONSULTANT FOR OPTIMAL NMR IMAGING Medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a new expensive imaging modality which avoids ionizing radiation and provides excellent diagnostic images.  The images produced depend on both the properties of the patient's tissues and the radiologist controlled parameters of the MRI scanner.  When scanner parameters are selected with clearcut objectives accounting for the patients's history, anatomic relationships and the MR properties of relevant tissues, accurate diagnostic images result. There are expert MRI radiologists who understand these tradeoffs, and use heuristic reasoning to simplify the mathematical and clinical complexity.  Their expertise can be encoded into a knowledge-based expert computer system.  Specifically, we propose to accomplish the following research:  1. Using existing methods of artificial intelligence and knowledge engineering, construct a first prototype expert system. It will be designed to incorporate the following functionality: o  Be a useful consultant for twenty representative situations involving the anatomy of the head, such as multiple sclerorsis, acoustic neuroma and pituitary adenoma. o  In a given clinical setting, produce a set of MR imaging parameters optimal for determining if a specific disease process is present. o  Be able to explain its reasoning in terms comprehensible to radiologists.  2.  Explore different inference strategies for reasoning about complex MRI physics interactions, such as constraint algorithms and mixed forward/backward chaining approaches.  3.  Build a user interface uniquely suited to the needs of radiologists engaged in MR imaging.  4.  Expand the knowledge of the prototype by incorporating changes in MR imaging technology and gradually including more anatomical regions.  5.

"KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEM FOR CARDIAC IMAGE INTERPRETATION The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop a clinically useful, computer-based methodology to assist in decision-making tasks in medical imaging.  The methodology consists of a novel approach combining well-established mathematical methods and artificial intelligence techniques for simultaneously representing medical knowledge and handling visual information.  The specific aims of the proposed research are to develop, implement, test, and validate a knowledge-based system for interpreting three-dimensional thallium-201 myocardial distributions obtained by tomographic imaging.  These interpretations will assist clinicians in detecting and localizing coronary artery disease.  The research will be carried out in a collaboration between Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology, thus providing a unique, interdisciplinary, and interinstitutional approach that directs complementary clinical and scientific resources toward this important medical problem. The five-year research program consists of four projects, dealing with (1) knowledge representation, (2) image understanding, (3) clinical acceptance and validation, and (4) system extension and refinement.  Preliminary studies indicate that the methodology can provide both accurate cardiac image interpretations and graphical, computer-generated representations of arterial structure.  The approach can serve as a clinically useful model with applications to other imaging modalities, and can also be used as a tool for tutoring and training clinicians.  The knowledge-based system is designed to be sufficiently extensible and flexible to accommodate the far-term objectives of eventually providing decision-making support to clinicians in tasks associated with diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis.

"EXPERT SYSTEM ADVISOR FOR DRUG DETOXIFICATION This application proposes the development of a rule-based interactive computer expert system (DETOX) that will provide assistance to physicians in writing detoxification orders for sedative-hypnotic, opiate and stimulant withdrawal.  Inappropriate detoxification protocols can be at best ineffective and at worse lethal.  The knowledge required for preparing appropriate detoxification protocols is highly specialized.  For many physicians, this knowledge is not readily available.  DETOX will provide a means of allowing physicians to easily tap this knowledge.  The resulting expected benefits are 1) safer and more accurate detoxification procedures 2) more reliable treatment in that all relevant information will be requested.  3) more rapid delivery of treatment and 4) lower treatment costs by making more efficient use of physician's time.  The proposed scope of DETOX's knowledge includes all sedative- hypnotic, opiates, and stimulants in Physician's Desk Reference; the alcohol content of commercially available beers, wines, and liquors; withdrawal protocols, key references to published detoxification protocols; and street drug nomenclature.  The expert system will emulate a physician expert in writing detoxification orders.  The systems user, in response to computer prompts, will enter the patient's drug history and other medical information needed by the expert system to compute the withdrawal schedule. Output of the system is a detoxification protocol, a summary of medical facts considered in computing the schedule, and the forms needed to clinically monitor the patient during withdrawal.

"AUTOMATED EXPERT CONSULTATION FOR MALADAPTIVE BEHAVIORS The goal of most treatments for individuals with mental retardation/ developmental disabilities is to maximize their assets and allow them to live in the least restrictive setting possible. Maladaptive behaviors, however, significantly interfere with these goals by preventing institutionalized individuals from being placed into less restrictive environments.  Due to a variety of pressures, staff in these institutions have difficulty treating these individuals and need expert assistance to develop more effective and efficient treatment plans.  This proposal describes the development and evaluation of an automated expert consultation system, concerning the effective treatment of maladaptive behaviors, designed to meet the need for efficient treatment planning.  The development of this system will be based on the clinical judgments of human experts, as well as, the current scientific literature concerning the treatment of individuals who engage in these maladaptive behaviors.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED BIOLOGICAL MODELING INFORMATION SYSTEM The Committee on Models for Biomedical Research has proposed a ""matrix of biological knowledge"" (Matrix) to address the need for a means to organize and intelligently access the wealth of information that confronts biomedical researchers (c.f. Models for Biomedical Research, National Academy Press, 1985).  To implement the matrix will require a fusion of artificial intelligence (AI) and database technologies as well as an understanding of the structure of biological knowledge.  However, a full implementation of the Matrix is best not attempted until pilot studies on a restricted domain of knowledge have demonstrated the feasibility and utility of the concept.  One domain of considerable general interest is that of nucleic acid and protein sequence libraries, which have become invaluable research tools for a large segment of the biomedical research community. In addition to the libraries themselves a large number of computer programs have been written to analyze the sequence data, which has resulted in major new discoveries.  The utility of these libraries to the typical laboratory investigator could be greatly enhanced by augmenting them with the types of knowledge management and reasoning systems envisioned for the Matrix. The goal of this proposed work is to build a testbed for the Matrix concept on top of the existing sequence libraries, benefitting both the larger goals of the Matrix and the immediate needs of sequence library users.  Steps in this process will include: (1) implementation of the GenBank database in a relational form, interfaced to an AI environment; (2) creation of a series of knowledge bases relating to the database, starting with simple taxonomies and progression to more complex representations (on narrower test domains); (3) creation of a set of user interfaces oriented to the needs of molecular biologist; and (4) investigation of various techniques of inference against the knowledge base, in particular reasoning by analogy, with the ultimate aim of allowing users to build and test hypotheses locally.

"INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM PERIPHERAL NERVES This work is directed toward providing better rehabilitation for people suffering from somatosensory loss and paralysis due to spinal cord injury, head trauma or stroke.  The goal of this project is to demonstrate that information suitable for controlling prosthetic devices, for modulating functional electrical stimulation of muscle, and for providing a sense of touch and position from areas of the body suffering sensory loss can be extracted, on line and in real time, from recordings of sensory activity in peripheral nerves.  This will be done by developing software which digitizes action potentials from multiunit recordings of peripheral nerve activity made with implanted intrafascicular electrodes; creates templates of the measured characteristics for identified single units; generates a decision tree which allows rapid assignment of an action potential to one of the templates or to an ""not identified"" category; and measures the distribution of activity among the set of identified units from recordings made during natural stimulation.  Once this is completed, a prototype hardware system that can perform this analysis on line in real time will be built.  While the thrust of this work is directed toward developing a microprocessor based instrument capable of providing sensory feedback for controlling movement of hands and limbs in paralyzed patients or for controlling stimulation of intact sensory systems to provide proprioceptive and tactile sensations from insensate regions, such a system will/would also be useful in research on the encoding and processing of sensory information by the nervous system.

"INVESTIGATION OF PROBLEM-SOLVING & MAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS We propose a five year program of investigation into problem- solving in immunohematology, leading to the development of a knowledge-based decision support system and a prototype intelligent tutoring system.  Initially, the techniques and methodologies of cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence will be used in tandem to investigate the problem-solving of practitioners in immunohematology at various levels of expertise.  During this period the knowledge and problem-solving used by individuals performing various interpretation tasks in immunohematology will be described from an information processing perspective.  This description will be performed within the context of the generic task theory of problem-solving, which has proven successful in constructing expert systems in a variety of medical fields.  In order to more fully understand the performance of immunohematologists, both correct/expert performance and error-producing behavior will be modeled.  The resultant models will then be used as the basis for developing knowledge-based systems to support the education and practice of immunohematology.

"MULTIDIMENSIONAL HEART IMAGING WITH ULTRASOUND We have recently successfully produced three-dimensional shaded surface ultrasound images of the left ventricular chamber of a human using a new method of transducer staqblization and rotation. Daa for producing multidimensional volumetric images were acquired by incrementally rotating a sector scanner transducer through 180% about its central beam centered at an appropriate acousic window. Fifty angles of view were recorded for subsequent selection by gating with the ECG and respiration.  Sctor scan images were then selected from each view at appropriate points in the heart and respiratory cycles and inserted into a three-dimensional volume. The resulting imates promise new methods of analyzing complex dynamic geometries of the heart and great vessels using advanced workstation software.  This proposal is a collaborative effort between one of the largest, most experienced echo cardiography laboratories and an active, widely knwon ultrasonic research laboratory.  The Biodynamics Research Unit, of which the Ultrasound Laboratory is a part, has been developing multidimensional imaging devices (such as the Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor) and software for more than 20 years. One major result from this effort has been ANALYZE a widely used Mayo-developed multidimensional data nalaysis package. It is this vast experience in multidimensional software and pioneering efforts in clinical echocardiography that provide the expertise for this proposed reseach.  The proposal consists of four aims.  First, we will refine our methods of multidimensional scanning by developing methods of transducer stabilizaation, image synchronization, and image digitization and storage (on digital cassette tape).  Second, we will evaluate the fidelity of the multidimensional images and calculated parameters using data obtained from fresh fixed hearts in a water tank, anesthetized animals (also scanned on the DSR), and selected volunteers and patients.  Third, we will develop advanced software for cliniclly specific analysis and measurement of myocardial structure and function from the ultrasound vol.umetric data.  Fourth, using ROC analysis, we will test the accuracy and clinical usefulness of the data acquisition and analysis workstation concept using specifically selected cardiac lesions proven clinically or surgically in a large number of patients.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.

"COMPUTER BASED PATHOLOGY CONSULTATION SUBMODULE We propose a three year program of investigation into the use of expert systems for the diagnosis of liver disease, using deep reasoning methods based on structure/function models. This research would lead to the refinement of our prototype system Pathex/Liver-1 for liver disease diagnosis. As part of this refinement process, techniques and methodologies of artificial intelligence will be used to investigate the problem-solving of experts in the diagnosis of liver disease.  Specifically, research will be directed toward:  1. the expansion of the current Pathex/Liver-1 expert system in order to recommend diagnoses in a larger class of liver diseases and associated disorders.  2. the expansion of the current Pathex/Liver-1 expert system in order to increase the types of data it can gather.  3.

"EARLY DETECTION OF CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT MELANOMA Melanoma is the most lethal skin-cancer.  The occurrence rate of malignant melanoma among the white population is rising faster than almost any other cancer in North America.  Nearly all patients can be saved and cured by early detection and prompt surgical treatment.  The important diagnostic and prognostic variables of melanoma are the vertical thickness, three- dimensional (3D) size and shape, and color of the lesion.  The other characteristic features of early melanoma are irregularities in the boundary of the lesion, and the appearance of non-uniform pigmentation with a variety of color.  The initial changes are subtle and cannot be observed with the naked eye.  A novel optical instrument called the ""Nevoscope"" has been developed to view the multiple images of the lesion in situ from several angles by transilluminating the skin-lesion.  The multiple views have been digitized and 3D images of the lesion have been reconstructed to measure the thickness and 3D size.  The objective of this research is to improve the design and performance of the Nevoscope, to perform analysis on thickness, 3D size, color, and margin, boundary and surface characteristics to detect early malignant lesions.  The approach proposed here is based on the knowledge-based analysis and interpretation of the images of the transilluminated skin-lesion.  The complete system will be tested in a clinical environment.  The analysis and interpretation will be compared with the histology and the diagnosis made by a dermatologist for the lesions whose excisions have been planned.

"LINKAGE ANALYSIS METHODS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA The long-term goal is to provide new and improved analytical methods that will enable researchers to find gene markers genetically linked with the putative gene(s) for schizophrenia.  This, in turn, will open the way to identifying the schizophrenia gene(s).  Once such genes are found, there is hope that knowledge of their structure will lead to a deeper understanding of the disease etiology and, thus, to the possibility of ameliorating or curing schizophrenia.  The specific aims consist of developing more efficient methods of linkage analysis than have previously been employed.  Also, automated computer- based methods will be developed to allow researchers to decide which families and which family members in a family to ascertain so as to maximize linkage information with a minimum of individuals tested. Nonparametric methods will be extended to allow for phenocopies (affected sib pair methods) and for both recombination and linkage disequilibrium (haplotype relative risk statistic).  New likelihood methods of linkage analysis will be derived by focusing attention on a subset of disease phenotypes so as to reduce dependency on model assumptions, by allowing for an oligogenic rather than a monogenic mode of inheritance of schizophrenia, and by considering disease status jointly with biological indicator variables as a multivariate phenotype.  The methods will be obtained by statistical investigation and will be implemented in computer programs, partly by modifying existing multi-point computer programs.  Programs and methods will be made available to researchers and will also be applied to schizophrenia families collected by other researchers, particularly those of Dr. Baron.

"STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY AND TARGETED DRUG DESIGN FOR AIDS This proposal will focus on the use of structural biology to aid in the development of drugs that can interfere in a specific manner with protein products of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) genome.  Since HIV is the etiological agent implicated in Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), it is hoped that these drugs will cure or at least arrest the symptoms of AIDS. Finding a cure for AIDS in an extremely urgent health priority for the world.  However, it can be anticipated that the methodologies developed in this AIDS-targeted project could lay the foundations for the development of other anti-viral agents that inevitably will evolve in the future to plaque mankind.  Inhibitors will be developed toward several HIV proteins:  the reverse transcriptase, the protease, the integrase and the ribonuclease H activity of the reverse transcriptase. Recombinant methods for viral protein production will be developed.  These proteins, as well as viral proteins obtained from external sources, as appropriate, will be highly purified, crystallized and subjected to X-ray diffraction (or NMR) analysis.  The emerging structures will be modeled using computer graphics, and potential inhibitors will in turn be modeled into the structures using molecular mechanics, quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence.  Candidate inhibitors will be synthesized, tested with enzyme systems, and sometimes co-crystallized with the enzyme for further structural analysis.  Ideas for even more potent and selective inhibitors should then emerge.  Site-directed- mutagenesis will be used to refine notions about which groups on the enzyme are involved in the inhibitor process.

"COMPUTER-ASSISTED STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION The characterization of the structure of a biomolecule on the its  chemical and spectral properties is of widespread importance in the biomedical sciences.  Because of its complexity, structure characterization is overall a time-consuming activity that has been largely left to experts in the field.  The goal of this research is to substantially increase the productivity of those experts.  Given the expert's proficiency in readily picking out the correct structure of an unknown from among a limited number of alternative structures, a much more expeditious assignment of structure would be achieved if the expert could begin the structure characterization problem with such a conceptually manageable number of plausible alternatives.  Thus, the goal of the research is to create artificial intelligence based computer software capable of directly reducing the collective spectral properties (infrared, proton and carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet and mass spectral data) of the unknown to a conceptually manageable number of stereochemically defined structures, each of which is compatible with the observed spectral data.  The expert is still a required player, but is spared what is actually the time-intensive component of the ""manual"" process, that of producing the limited number of alternatives.  Key features of the software to be created include, (1) programs for both spectrum interpretation and structure generation, (2) provision to accept any structural information known to the expert and (3) the capability to treat real-world structure characterization problems without regard to the class of structures to which the unknown belongs.  The last named feature requires a system that is not spectral library dependent.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"GENETIC DATABASES--APPLICATIONS FOR MACHINE LEARNING Recent advances in neural network theory, in which the present authors have played a significant role, have resulted in machine learning algorithms of great power.  In an initial investigation, the authors have applied these algorithms to detecting and exploiting pattern regularities in DNA and also in amino acid sequences.  In the two situations considered thus far (determination of whether or not a fragment of DNA codes for a protein, and predicting protein secondary structure given amino acid sequence) the results of the neural net analysis technique equals or exceeds results of conventional methods.  We propose to intensively investigate these two problems with the goal of verifying and expanding our initial results, particularly to DNA sequences of other species, especially humans.  We plan to expand our investigations to include pattern recognition searches for promoter/terminator sequences, intron/exon splice junctions, and other regulatory signals.  Methods for the sequence to structure problem will be extended to include new results in energy minimization techniques for analogue models that contain numerous local minima.  Different network architectures and different representations for the data will be investigated.  When a neural net method exceeds a conventional method in accuracy we plan to analyze the network connections with the goal of understanding what rules the network developed (by virtue of the learning algorithm) that yielded the increased accuracy.

"COMPUTER RESOURCE--MOLECULAR MECHANICS AND NEURO-ANATOMY This computer resource facility is currently completing two major core projects which we believe will, during the next year, make a major contribution to the research community in general and our collaborative research in particular.  FASTRUN, an attached processor computing device for which the original design was done at the facility, is now being constructed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory as a joint project.  This processor, which is a long pipeline to compute the non-bonded pairwise forces, will be completed and delivered to Columbia within the next two months. Combined with a STAR-100 array processor, now running at the facility and a microvax as host, the system which MERCURY (Molecular Energy Refinement at Columbia University) is expected to have a computing speed somewhat greater than a CRAY-2 but only for molecular mechanics of large molecules; dynamics energy minimization, free energy of binding, etc.  The system will be used in efforts to compute the conformations of molecules whose amino acid sequence is known and are homologous to structures which have been solved crystallographically.  It will also be used to compute the ionic conductance through a protein which forms a small ion channel as the amino acid sequence of the protein is changed by site-directed mutagenesis.  The second major project is the development of a computing system for a SUN 160/3 with image processing boards for automatic extraction of cell and fiber outlines from serial section micrographs.  The system now works well enough so that it can reduce the time and tedium of manual nerve tracing by about a factor of ten.  It will be available for neuroanatomical users in the near future, and will be used initially for reconstruction of the cerebellum in developing mice in connection with experiments which study gene expression by means of in situ hybridization. The programs will be improved substantially so that the system will run for long periods without any investigator intervention. The verification and decision making which must be done by the human observer, will be carried out in one interactive process after the automatic system has operated on previously stored images.  As the hardware and the software for this system is developed, it will be available for use by many investigators both local and from other institutions.

"SPECIAL SYMPOSIUM ON MATURING TECHNOLOGIES The field of Biomedical Engineering has developed into a major component of science and technology.  Although biomedical engineering has contributed to important established technologies, new horizons are continually emerging.  To highlight these maturing technologies and to define the emerging horizons, funds are requested to partially support a special topic Symposium on Biomedical Engineering to be held in association with the IEEE/EMBS 1988 Annual Conference, November 4-7, in New Orleans.  The Symposium will involve national and international academic, medical and industrial research leaders who will focus on scientific and technical advances, applications, limitations, and problems to be solved.  The Symposium will thus serve as an educational function to its hundreds of attendees as well as an informational, planning and assessment function of the field.  IEEE/EMBS is the largest professional society of biomedical engineers in the world with over 7000 members.  It operates as a scientific and technical society of specific bioengineering focus within the broader structure of the IEEE, the world's largest engineering professional organization with approximately 275,000 members.  The Society publishes each month an archival refereed periodical, the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering (T- BME), which is considered by many authorities to be the best in the field.  In addition, it publishes a quarterly magazine, the EMB Magazine, the first such periodical in the BME field.  It also publishes each year full papers in its Annual Conference Proceedings and, from time to time, sponsors publication of IEEE Press Books of Special Issues of T-BME on selected scientific and technical subjects.  The tenth annual meeting of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) will be held in New Orleans, November 4-7, 1988. This meeting has grown from approximately 100 papers in 18 sessions in 1979 to more than 1200 papers in over 200 sessions in 1987. Approximately one-third of the participants at the 1987 meeting represented foreign countries, confirming that the EMBS meeting has become the major meeting for biomedical engineers in the world. As a part of the forthcoming meeting, a special symposium entitled ""Maturing Technologies and Emerging Horizons in Biomedical Engineering"" is planned to highlight and focus the major issues confronting this interdisciplinary field.  The tentative topics and speakers highlight important emerging fields such as neural networks, artificial intelligence, lasers in medicine and rehabilitation engineering, as well as established, but maturing and evolving fields including implantable cardiac devices, sensory motor systems, and biomaterials.  This symposium is planned as the centerpiece of the meeting and will have no other meeting components scheduled at the same time.  The format will be similar to that used of the special symposium of the 1986 meeting.  Three topics will be dealt with each morning of the meeting.  A plenary session will consist of the three speakers who will introduce and survey the topics.  Following this plenary session, three parallel sessions, one on each of the topics, will address the issues in greater depth.  During the course of the 4-day meeting, 12 subject areas will be highlighted.

"SYSTEMATIC DESIGN ENGINEERING CONTROL FOR ROBOTIC Because of the versatility and programmability of robots, workers most probably are not aware of the hazards of a particular robot configuration.  An effective traditional approach to achieve robotic safety utilizes mechanical means, such as mechanical stops and mechanical guarding devices.  However, this approach provides limited protection for personnel, hardware and/or the robot because of personnel's lack of understanding of the system software.  The proposed study is to develop an engineering control system for the robotic system.  This control system development has three phases:  Phase I-- will develop a systematic procedure and safety guideline for the planning stage of robot use; Phase II -- will construct a physical robot safety system model that incorporates the safety devices into the developed safety procedure and Phase III -- will design an intelligent monitoring software for the robot system safety.  In other words, the safety requirements in planning, installing and operating a robotic system are studied. The guideline in each application stage is developed with the construction of a demonstration model.  Emphasis is on the use of an engineering control approach in robotic system safety.  The study results can be applied to existing robots as an evaluation tool and to future robotic systems as a design guideline, thereby making the developed control system particularly useful for anticipating and avoiding safety hazards.

"SYMBOLIC SIMULATION OF DNA METABOLISM Using established methods of knowledge representation and rule- based expert systems I propose to develop a symbolic simulation of DNA metabolism.  Rule-based expert systems permit simulations of DNA metabolism which can predict the activity of both individual enzymes and of entire pathways under a wide variety of physiological conditions.  Both classical production rules and an assumption-based truth maintenance system will be used.  Rule-based methods have the intrinsic property of being able to explain conclusions using English sentences or graphic representations of the pattern of inference.  The enzymes, substrates and products will also be represented in a frame-based knowledge system.  Knowledge based systems facilitate the description of product-precursor relationships between different metabolites as well as the complete pathway.  Physiological conditions such as the presence of salts, nucleotides, temperature, ionic strength, pH, etc. will be presented graphically as active images of thermometers, gauges and switches.  All environmental and substrate conditions can be changed by using a mouse pointing device.  In response to changes of any parameter, a series of rules defining the specificity and reactivity of enzymes are automatically invoked and specific conclusions are made. The methods for specifying the actions of enzymes are well defined, allowing ready simulation of other enzymes.  Simulations of individual enzymatic steps can be coupled together to generate a discrete event simulation of the entire metabolic pathway.

"PHYSICIAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION USING GRAPHICS AND SPEECH Recent advances in speech-recognition technology have made spoken language a viable interface medium for human-computer communication, promising increased acceptance of medical computer systems by physicians and other health workers. However, speech recognition techniques have not yet advanced to the point where understanding of unconstrained speech is possible. We accordingly propose a staged research plan to study the way computer graphics can be bused to constrain the possible meanings of an utterance, thereby promoting physician-computer communication that is both effective and practical.  We will create a prototype speech-and-graphics interface to ONCOCIN, a medical advice system previously developed in our laboratory.  We will use this prototype in experiments to discover how we might expand the interaction language to support more fully the kinds of phrases physicians would want to speak to ONCOCIN's graphical datasheet.  The results of these experiments will be used to extend the number and kind of phrases the ONCOCIN interface can accept.  We will then explore the use of graphics to constrain the task of speech-recognition of limited dictated text.  Using the same techniques employed for the graphical datasheet, we will design a structured progress note for reporting the status of cancer patients and implement it as a graphical interface.  In a parallel endeavor, we will perform experiments to study the language used in creating progress notes by simulating a graphical progress note entry system.  The research we propose benefits from our use of ONCOCIN, a medical expert system that already has a sophisticated graphical interface and is in limited clinical use.  The research gains additional impetus from our collaboration with Speech Systems incorporated, a company that is providing us with advanced speech-recognition technology.

"A CANCER RADIOTHERAPY EXPERT SYSTEM USING SIMULATION Radiation therapy for cancer is one of the first areas in which computers were widely used in support of clinical practice, dating back at least twenty years.  The initial application, still the major one today, was the calculation of radiation dose in the tumor region and in other locations of the patient's body.  However, knowledge about clinical implications of radiation treatment has been difficult to systematize in a form suitable for computer processing.  The number and range of treatment options is large.  Treatment optimization based on dose computations with variation of parameters can only handle a few of the possible options.  As an alternative approach to systematizing clinical knowledge of radiation effects, this project will develop an expert system for planning radiation therapy.  The problem of planning radiation therapy presents challenges in the design of expert systems.  Efficiency and flexibility are important because of the large problem space.  In addition, some of the knowledge of radiation treatment planning is most naturally expressed in the form of constraints, rather than production rules.  Most important, decision-making normally relies on a treatment simulation system to provide dose and geometric information about proposed treatment strategies.  To meet these requirements this project will develop and investigate the properties of an expert system that integrates with a treatmet simulation system.  The two systems will be coupled using a message passing technique previously developed for the simulation system internal operation.  The expert system will use both frames and production rules as appropriate tothe problem domain.  Constraint mechanisms will be introduced which allow constraints to be strengthened or weakened as the system preceeds toward a solution.  The simulation system will be coupled to the expert system as a means of checking constraint satisfaction and graphically displaying the solution(s).  The integration of a simulation system with appropriate knowledge representation techniques should provide new insight into methods of constraint satisfaction, and also extend understanding of the design and behavior of hybrid systems.

"METHOD FOR FEATURE ANALYSIS IN MEDICAL IMAGING Research will be undertaken with the long-term objective of improving the means by which the performance of imaging technologies is assessed.  The increased complexity and the dynamic nature of the medical imaging field--in particular, the proliferation of CT scans and the emergence of magnetic resonance imaging--make especially apparent now the need for improved measures of assessment.  Such improved measures can be expected to lead to more appropriate use of those technologies.  The proposed project has two overall aims:  first, the develop improved methods of assessing diagnostic accuracy; and second, to test and demonstrate these methods with three imaging technologies, as used with a single organ and disease--i.e. mammography, thermography, and diaphanography in the diagnosis of breast cancer.  A methodology will be developed for defining the perceptual features of an image or set or images that are of diagnostic importance, and for determining the optimal combination of these features in a diagnostic judgment.  This methodology will further include techniques for training image interpreters to use the features according to the optimal prescription as well as computer-based decision aids to reinforce the optimal behavior in routine practice.  A fundamental idea is that measures of accuracy, which underlie measures of utility, should reflect the best, practically attainable, performance of the technology.  The proposed methodology elicits information about perceptual features from experts in a technology and diagnostic problem by means of structured interviews and group discussions.  It corroborates and refines the main features by mathematical techniques of multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering as based on similarity judgments of pairs of images.  Discriminant analysis is used to establish a final set of features and their optimal weights.  A computer classifier is developed to accept interpreters' ratings of the features and to issue a probability estimate for the diagnosis under consideration.  Preliminary studies, based on mammographic images, indicate that this methodology can produce a very substantial gain in diagnostic accuracy.  The product of this project will be a publication clearly describing the new methodology, so that it can be generally applied by clinical investigators in technology assessment.  Further, the empirical comparison of the accuracies of three technologies, and the determination of their accuracy in various combinations, will be of immediate import for the medical community.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE DATABASES The proposed work focuses on searching large nucleic acid sequence databases for functionally, structurally, and evolutionarily significant patterns.  There is a need to develop efficient and biologically relevant strategies for defining higher- order patterns and for using the defined pattern as a basis for searches through nucleic acid sequence databases (e.g., the GenBank database).  We will design and install on the Cray computer an improved set of algorithms that will:  (1) use a hash function to rapidly scan large databases for evidence of local similarity; (2) use a rigorous measure to find and score the best local alignments; (3) dynamically filter significant scores; and (4) store the results of the scan in a dynamically maintained database of similarity scores.  The increased speed and reduced cost of these algorithms will allow us to examine in greater detail variations in measures (on both nucleic acid and protein levels) of similarity; the programs will be well suited to the large-scale sequence comparison projects being planned for the Crays becoming available to the molecular biology research community.  We will develop an improved method for recognizing potential donor and acceptor sites for intron sequences.  We will re- examine the notion of ""consensus sequence"" donor and acceptor patterns as well as define additional attributes that distinguish these patterns.  These measures will be combined through discriminant analysis to create an algorithm that predicts whether or not a potential donor or acceptor site is functional.  We will develop a general approach for scanning large databases for structural patterns, initially in the context of a search for potential curved DNA sequences.  First we will develop useful measures for gauging curvature in DNA, and then test the predictions of the Tung-Harvey model by comparison with experimental results for curved DNA.  With the established measures and model, we will scan the GenBank database for anomalously curved regions, and determine whether or not they are correlated with the functional roles of coincident or neighboring sequences.

"LINKAGE ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE LOCI This research is designed to investigate the efficient localization and ordering of major genes through linkage analysis.  Although new gene mapping methods and programs have emerged, significant capabilities are still lacking and many of the statistical concepts are dated.  Gene mapping can be divided into two phases:  1) initial assignment of a gene to a chromosomal region, and 2) assignment of gene order and map distance of the disease locus to all of the markers.  The issues of significance and efficiency are different for these phases.  In the first phase, we are testing for linkage between the disease locus and well-spaced highly polymorphic markers.  Three locus evaluation of expected LOD scores and actual LOD scores are sufficient.  We will investigate significance levels of the three locus analysis for testing linkage on saturated maps.  For fine mapping we will compute expected LOD scores and LOD scores for gene order with multiple loci.  We will also establish significance levels for comparison of orders.  The preliminary LOD scores sufficient to justify a switch in strategy from localization to establishing order will be described.  As the set of tools for calculating expected LOD scores and LOD scores are investigated, a knowledge-based expert system will be developed which will integrate these tools with the appropriate databases and rules. The system will be an automated tool assisting in designing the experiments, evaluating data from the experiments, and redesigning the experiment in light of the preliminary results.  Thus, the large number of linkage experiments carried out in the near future can be performed efficiently.

"INTELLIGENT SOFTWARE FOR WORKING WITH CHEMICAL DIAGRAMS The proposed efforts initiates research into an integrated tool for research documentation designed around the unique needs and communication language of biochemical researchers.  A computer system called ChemWriter will be implemented in Phase II from the Phase I design.

Existing tools offer only piece-meal and non-integratable solutions.  ChemWriter would enhance the research documentation process, increase researcher productivity, and speed dissemination of important research results.  The design for Chemwriter is developed through a methodology for human-computer interface design originated and successfully applied by the proposed principal investigator.  The methodology focuses on analyzing the functional needs of the specialist in the application domain (i.e., the biochemical researcher), and designing the user interface to fit these needs.  Software 'form' is then designed to the use-oriented function of the interface.

"INTERACTIVE 3-D COMPUTER ANIMATION AND ANALYSIS OF SPORT More Americans than ever before are participating in competitive sports, and the number of sports-related injuries has increased to about 17 million per year.  For the elderly, such injuries often signal an end to vigor, productivity, and enjoyment of their lifestyle.  At the same time, American performance in inter- national sports competition seems to be declining if one is to judge by Olympic medals, Davis Cup, Ryder Cup, World Cup Skiing, and the like.  The field of computer biomechanics has proved useful both for improvement in athletic performance and for analysis of injury- causing motion.  But application of the method in sports medicine is hampered by the lack of a basic measurement tool a general method for digitization of the entire human body which is accurate, rapid, and inexpensive, i.e. automatic.  The long-range goal of this proposal (Phase II) is to provide such a method and put it on the market.

"DIGITAL VIEWING STATIONS FOR DIAGNOSTIC IMAGES The arrival of high speed digital electronic communication in radiological sciences is gradually changing the method of acquiring, communicating, storing, and viewing diagnostic images. One natural development due to this change is the emergence of the digital radiology department.  In the previous study we demonstrated the feasibility of such a development by designing and implementing two clinical multiple digital viewing stations in the Pediatric Radiology Section.  During this study related technological problems which had hindered such development were also solved.  They were:  (1) the conversion of conventional radiographic images into high resolution digital images by using a laser film scanner and a computed radiographic system, (2) development of a digital optical disk storage system for mass image storage, and (3) the installation of a broadband communication system for rapid networking of images.  The purpose of this research proposal is to continue this development and to have a complete digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section in the Radiological Sciences Department within five years.  This digital-based operation in the Pediatric Radiology Section includes patient registration, image acquisition, mass storage, network communication, and image viewing.  The first two years will be used for the integration of various components into a total digital viewing system and to gain clinical acceptance.  The third year will be for clinical trials of the complete digital-based operation.  The fourth year will be for phasing out of the film- based operation and extending the digital viewing system capabilities to the pediatric department and to the genitourinary radiology section.  The last year will be used for clinical evaluations and planning of the total digital viewing system for the entire department.  It is anticipated that this project will become a success because we have met all the technological requirements as well as have considered and studied the psychological implications of a digital review system.  The importance of building and evaluating such a digital viewing system as an alternate method for the current film-based operation is obvious since a successful execution of the current project will change the direction of viewing radiological images in the future.

"COMPUTER-BASED RESPIRATORY SUPPORT CONSULTANT The aggressive respiratory management protocols used in testing infants suffering from acute hyaline membrane disease (HMD) involves maintaining a delicate balance between meeting the infant's respiratory needs and avoiding the devastating long-term consequences of excessive airway pressures and oxygen.  Systematic use of all the knowledge affecting ventilator therapy decisions will improve the quality of care, particularly during periods when the most experienced clinicians are not present.  The objective of this project is to design and implement a computer-based system which will aid clinicians in providing appropriate respiratory support for infants suffering acute HMD.  The system will build on our previously developed computer-based HMD course and management model. Knowledge of treatment protocols and the therapeutic and diagnostic states under which each protocol operates will be derived from our current clinical practices.  This knowledge will be expressed as treatment and diagnostic rules and incorporated in a small knowledge-based system written in Turbo Prolog and implemented on a personal computer.  Such an approach allows flexible use of qualitative physiological and clinical knowledge to an extent which is difficult to achieve with traditional programming methods.  The resulting system can be modified and expanded to extend the domain of applicability to a broader population and improve the system's predictive accuracy.  This system will use readily available data (e.g. blood gases, respirator settings, physical signs) in conjunction with diagnostic rules to maintain a list of attributes reflecting an individual baby's current physiological and treatment status.  The system will search the treatment rules for all applicable therapy changes which could correct a given blood gas abnormality, and list the alternatives along with their side effects and the applicable rationale.  It will be a valuable tool in teaching the principles of ventilator management.

Center research falls into two broad categories:  parcellation, or rapid and reproducible identification of the boundaries of subareas in histological images, and quantification, or the measurement of the relative or absolute values of underlying substance values from optical images of these regions.  The parcellation project utilizes expert system technology for knowledge based image analysis.  Quantification projects include the development of a computerized system for the determination of local thickness of variation, of computer techniques for the detection of local variations within brain regions, and for the quantification of autoradiograms.

"MULTIMODALITY CARDIAC IMAGE UNDERSTANDING An image understanding system is proposed to analyze cardiac dysfunction found by combining information from multiple, noninvasive imaging modality studies.  The system is a model for intelligent multimodality image understanding in general, but is applied to a very specific problem:  detection and rating of left ventricular (LV) aneurysms.  Key features of the system are:  1) its ability to handle and quantify uncertain or partial image- derived information in a concise way using probabilistic evidential reasoning, 2) its ability to fuse pertinent relative information from independent diagnostic images of the same patient to achieve an algorithm-assembled, consensus, quantitative opinion of cardiac shape and motion, and finally 3) to arrive at a decision- level set of numbers that quantify and localize left ventricular aneurysm formation for each patient.  The availability of data such as described in 3) will enable more precise prognostic or diagnostic risk classification for patients, making therapy alternatives more rational.  Because of the subjective probabilistic reasoning strategy (based on the principle of maximum entropy) the final quantitative results will carry not only the system's assessment of a particular patients' heart, but also the degree of confidence that the automated analysis system has in the result it presents.  This confidence is increased when similar LV motion and shape is perceived by the multiple imaging modalities.  The proposed system design is influenced by current artificial intelligence and image understanding technologies, but remains firmly grounded in more classical mathematical and statistical methodology.  The system will be initially tested using radionuclide angiographic (RNA) and two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE) semi- quantified (manual tracing of LV borders) and then fully quantified (by the system's own border-finding algorithm) studies and compared with qualitative readings, quantified contrast ventriculograms, and then with surgeon's and pathologist's measurements and reports.  Preliminary studies show that 1) RNA left lateral view qualitative studies correlate well with pathology, 2) that complementary 2DE views help resolve RNA problems with finding the anterior LV wall and 3) quantification of LV motion and shape better defines the spectrum between normal and grossly abnormal.  Subsequent incorporation of magnetic resonance images (which have improved LV boundary definition) into the evaluation system will test its ability to adapt to and profit from new types of data.

We expect that the method will give quantitative, graphical information about repeated patterns (allowing for some differences between instances of the patterns) that can be used to identify important features in the sequences that are typical of known functional domains of DNA and proteins.

"KNOWLEDGE BASED RADIOLOGY INFORMATION SYSTEM The goal of this project is to improve the accuracy of the radiologist as he/she interprets x-ray examinations.  Two computer-based approaches to this goal will be studied.  First a computer-generated, patient-specific consult will be made availabe to the radiologist at the time he reads the x-ray.  It will consist of a brief clinical summary whose elements are chosen for their information content, a differential diagnostic list containing the patients 1 to 5 most likely diseases, and a list of prompts indicating those abnormal x-ray findings that would contribute the most to diagnosing the patient.  The second technique investigated will be a computer-managed, continuous audit that will use the discharge diagnoses of each patient to help determine the average accuracy of the x-ray interpretations.  This mechanism can provide feedback to the individual radiologists concerning the specific diseases and findings for which their readings are suboptimal.  Evaluation will be through comparison of the chest x-ray interpretations generated with and without the consult/prompt system.  Two approaches will be used.  The first will compare all examinations from a 12-month period before implementation with those from a similar period after implementation.  The second will assess the difference in interpretations on 200 select chest x- rays interpreted by six physicians with and without the consult and prompts.  For this test, an expert panel will determine the actual abnormalities present.  The collected interpretations of the 200 films will be used to test the audit system to determine whether its results conform with the results of traditional measures of performance based on rereading multiple x-rays.  The applications created during this project will use the expert system tools in the HELP system combined with a group of knowledge management routines.  An implicit goal of the project is to investigate the application of information theory to the problem of accuracy in the radiology department.  These tools will have general applicability in medicine.

"QUANTIFYING NITROARENE GENOTOXICITY IN COMPLEX MIXTURES The biological activity of nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitroarenes) has ben the subject of extensive study primarily because of the potent mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of some nitroarenes as well as their widespread occurrence in the environment, principally as the result of incomplete combustion processes.  However, most of us are not exposed primarily to individual compounds but rather to complex mixtures both outdoors (emissions from automobiles, power plants, etc.) and indoors (cigarette smoke, heaters, stoves, ovens etc).  The objective of the work proposed in this application is to relate the genotoxic and carcinogenic activities of individual nitroarenes to activities of artificial mixtures and extracts of emission particulates in order to use data for single chemicals to evaluate the risk of exposure to complex mixtures.  The proposed project, which employs both computerized and experimental methodologies, will involve professionals with expertise in chemistry, biochemistry, microbiology, artificial intelligence and risk assessment, and with extensive experience in the study of nitroarenes.  Two computerized techniques will be used.  First, Computer Automated Structure Evaluation (CASE), an artificial intelligence program which was developed to predict the mutagenicity of nitroarenes, will be used to identify structural determinants of mutagenicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Second, the Carcinogenicity Prediction and Battery Selection (CPBS) method will used to identify appropriate batteries of short-term tests for screening individual nitroarenes and mixtures and to predict potential carcinogenicity, including carcinogenic potency.  Experimental studies will be directed towards assessing the activities of compounds in mixtures.  Artificial mixtures of pairs of nitroarenes or related compounds, as well as extracts of combustion emissions combined with individual chemicals, will be tested for mutagenicity, metabolic activation and deactivation of mutagenicity, mammalian genotoxicity and metabolic biotransformation.  Three issues will be addressed:  whether activities are additive or are influenced by competition for enzymatic activation, whether inactivating structures identified by CASE represent alternative biotransformation or competition and how the presence of a complex mixture influences the metabolism, mutagenicity and genotoxicity of individual chemicals.  Resolving these questions about the extrapolation from individual components to mixtures would allow data for individual chemicals concerning bioavailability, metabolism, genotoxicity, detoxification and excretion to be used to reduce uncertainty in the assessment of human risk from exposure in incomplete combustion products and other complex mixtures.

"COMPUTERIZED ELECTROCARDIOLOGY Funds are requested to support publication of the Proceedings of the 1989 Conference on Computerized Interpretation of the Electrocardiogram in the Journal of Electrocardiology.  This will be the 14th Annual Conference which in past years has been co- sponsored by the Engineering Foundation and ISCE.  The topic area is particularly important as it is estimated that about 51 million electrocardiograms processed annually by computer in the United States, and that there are over 15,000 devices in the field with analysis capabilities.  The overall objective of this Conference is to exchange the most recent information and advances in computer analyses in electrocardiology among biomedical engineers, computer scientists, electrophysiologists, clinical researchers, and epidemiologists. Most of the participants come from academic organizations and public health agencies; many are scientists and engineers from companies with a heavy commitment to research and development activities in these areas.  The multi-disciplinary nature of the speakers will allow in depth exploration and discussion of technical/ scientific issues such as mapping endocardial, epicardial, and body surface potential distributions, sampling and data compression methods, and high resolution, low level ECG recordings.  Eight sessions are planned over a 4 day period.  The philosophy of these Conferences, like Gordon Conferences, is to maximize opportunities for participants to discuss issues on the frontiers of electrocardiology.  Formal presentations with considerable time for discussion are held mornings and evenings. Afternoons are available for free discussion in small study groups or workshops; poster sessions are also held in the afternoons.  The scientific areas addressed ideally match the interests of the clinical electrocardiologist, electrophysiologist, and bioengineer readership of the Journal of Electrocardiology (1500 subscribers).

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN PROCESS PLANT SAFETY The major goal of this proposal is to research and demonstrate new approaches based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) towards the design of chemical process hazard detection, prevention, and control systems.  Such systems are extremely important for improving the occupational safety of chemical plants owing to the complexity of modern process plants.  Industrial statistics show that even though major catastrophies and disasters from chemical plant failures are infrequent, minor accidents are very common, occurring on a day to day basis, resulting in many occupational injuries and illnesses, costing the society billions of dollars every year.  The proposed project is aimed at the prevention and control of such frequent, day to day, accidental events in the industry. Past approaches in fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the human expert's reasoning strategies and experience and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct trouble- shooting.  We propose to improve this status by designing systems that would have better modeling of the problem-solving process through an appropriate representation of the domain knowledge through the use of causal modeling and reasoning from first principles, similar to human experts, by exploiting some of the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence.  We propose a methodology that aids the development of expert systems which are process-independent, transparent in their reasoning, resilient under unforeseen fault combinations, and capable of diagnosing a wide diversity of faults.  The domain knowledge of the system is based on a library of fault and causal models of process equipments as well as on the physical interconnections between equipment units and causal relationships among process state variables.  The inference strategy uses model-based reasoning for analyzing the plant behavior.  We describe a prototype expert system, called MODEX, based on our methodology.  The system has performed successfully on test cases of prototypical chemical process plants and looks promising.  However, before a successful transfer of this methodology to the industry can be initiated a number of research issues outlined in the proposal need to be resolved by experimenting with larger prototypical chemical plants.

"EXPERT SYSTEM FOR STROKE Expert systems represents a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with computer program solutions to problems normally solved by human experts.  Expert systems (and computer-aided medical decision-making) is gaining acceptance in medicine. These techniques may help physicians deal with both the explosion of published medical literature and the increased complexity of decision making (decision analysis, multivariate statistical prediction rules, etc.).  We propose to build a Stroke Expert System over 3 years.  This system will be designed to run on high-end microcomputers in a clinical setting.  We have broken stroke care into component problems:  anatomical localization, mechanism of stroke, testing, therapy, and prognosis.  The system is conceived as an integrated group of modules (each module dealing with one aspect of the stroke care problem).  In addition, a group of supportive modules are planned including an explanatory module, a bibliographic reference module, and a report generator.  These modules are integrated by a system executive which communicates with the end user through a uniform interface.  Information is exchanged between the component modules through a shared data table (blackboard).  Extensive development and validation experiments are planned.

"INFORMATION PROCESSING A new simultaneous experimental and theoretical interdisciplinary approach to study information processing in neuronal networks is suggested.  It combines a detailed electro-morphological study at the cellular level with mathematical analysis using a new tool for the Simulation of Neuronal Networks (SONN) which we plan to develop.  The idea is to consider neurons as a composition of subunits (e.g.,  axonal branch point), each performs specific information processing functions (Parnas and Segev, 1979).  These functional subunits are first characterized experimentally, then analyzed using detailed partial differential equations (P.D.E) models (e.g., Parnas et al., 1986 a, b, c).  Investigating these experimentally based models will eventually allow to abstract the subunits as independent processors or State Machines (S.M), which transform input to output and changes their internal states. SONN will include both P.D.E and the S.M models, the latter will serve to build a whole neuronal network and to analyze its information processing aspects in comparison to the experimental network.  We believe that this approach will help to establish a theoretical framework for connecting biophysical mechanisms to the function of the neural-network and will aid to refine and redefine models in Artificial Intelligence.  The heart ganglion of the lobster is the experimental network we plan to investigate.  The initial modeling will be done with SPICE, a general-purpose electrical network analysis program, which we have adapted for the use of neurobiologists (Segev et al., 1985). However, its limitations and the realization that an appropriate modeling tool is crucial for our purposes, prompted us to propose to develop SONN for performing ""on line"" theoretical experiments.  The emphasis is on developing graphical and mathematical tools to visualize the morphology and the electrical behavior of the modeled system using color codes.  We believe this approach will lead to a better understanding of the principles that underlie the function of neuronal networks.

"RADIOTRACER R & D IN NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND NEUROSCIENCE The availability of PET as a tool for research in biology and medicine has expanded significantly in the past decade along with the sophistication of the instrumentation and the diversity of radiotracers which are being applied to specific problems in biology and medicine.  The major scientific goal of this proposal is to address the key research issues in radiotracer chemistry and biochemistry which are required to accelerate the application of PET to new problems in biology and medicine.  Specific aims include high level economical production of fluorine-18 and carbon-11 on medical cyclotrons, mechanistic and synthetic chemistry as it relates to radiotracer synthesis and analytical control, radiotracer design and biochemistry as a linkage between PET measurements and the physiological process itself and automation of radiotracer production, and analysis including the use of knowledge-based artificial intelligence for rapid diagnosis of problems.  New radiotracers for assessing degree of malignancy in brain tumors by measuring functional ornithine decarboxylase activity (using 5-11C-ornithine) will be developed.  A new approach to radiotracer design, the use of 11C-labeled suicide inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) to assess functional enzyme activity initiated during this grant period will be further exploited.  The introduction of a major new thrust, the use of PET as a scientific tool in pharmaceutical research and development for new therapeutic drugs, will begin with the synthesis of positron emitter labeled drugs such as (11C) midazolam, a recently introduced benzodiazepine receptor active drug used in pre-anesthetic sedation.  Because of the growing importance of fluorine-18 for high resolution PET studies, and for measuring biological processes over a time interval of several hours, new approaches to its economical production in high yield on medical cyclotrons employing reusable solid 18O-targets and its efficient incorporation into a wide spectrum of 18F-tracers through the general synthesis of 3-(18F) fluoropropyl derivatives of biologically active compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET compounds will be developed.  This research which is motivated by the use of PET to address important scientific and medical issues will also be undertaken with a view to the economical supply of radiotracers from a central medical cyclotron-chemistry resource to satellite clinical PET facilities and to the pharmaceutical industry.

"DYNAMIC PATTERNS IN COMPLEX BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS This proposal seeks funding for a newly established Center for Complex Systems at Florida ATlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida.  The main scientific goal of the Center is to understand how a complex biological system containing very many degrees of freedom (e.g. neurons, muscles, vascular processes) generates ordered behavior or macroscopic, spatiotemporal patterns.  This problem is attacked on several levels of description by virtue of a direct, on-site collaboration between theoretical physics (including computational modeling), psychology and neurobiology. Experimental test fields are pattern generation in biologically significant, multidegree of freedom activities such as speech and limb coordination in humans and the analysis of well-defined rhythmic behaviors (e.g. feeding) in Helisoma and Pleurobranchaea.  The theoretical backdrop comes from synergetics, originally a physical theory for the spontaneous formation of pattern in open, nonequilibrium systems, but which now encompasses other fields as well.  Synergetics promotes a search for the essential variables of the system under study that are characteristic of its collective state (the so-called order parameters).  It is these order parameters and their dynamics (including both deterministic and stochastic aspects) that will be used to explain specific pattern formation phenomena in biology studied here, including:  stability and loss of stability leading to behavioral change (e.g. switching among multiple states), synchronization, entrainment and learning.  Analytic tools pertaining to the stability of patterns (both kinematic and neuronal) and the time scales on which they persist will be developed, e.g. relaxation time and fluctuational measures.  Such observables enter into explicit modeling work that is computationally implemented.  A working assumption behind the Center's mission and the present proposal is that the tools and concepts of synergetics (nonlinear dynamics) may be appropriate at both macroscopic behavioral levels (e.g. in patterns among muscles and kinematic events) and at the microscopic scale of neuronal patterns.  If so, it may be possible to derive the former from the latter by appropriate coupling among their respective dynamics.  Apart from important technological applications, e.g., in prosthetics and robotics, a concerted effort to understand cooperative state and their dynamics in normal behavior seems justified if disordered states are to be better understood.

"INDEXING AND RETRIEVING INFORMATION The goal of this proposal is to develop an expert system for archiving medical information.  The main feature of the system will be the ability to automatically index medical text with keywords.  Input to the system will consist of reports from medical charts, abstracts from the medical literature, and descriptive passages from teaching collections.  The system will retrieve information through requests formulated in natural language, or through Boolean combinations of keywords.   The knowledge base for the expert system will be a semantic network generated from thesauri of medical terms.  The expert system shell; the natural language and Boolean retrieval routines and utilities for thesaurus construction have already been developed. Partial thesauri containing an average of 3,000 terms and 15,000 links have been constructed for neuropathology, neuroradiology, and psychiatry.  These thesauri have been successfully tested in pilot studies of automated indexing and natural language retrieval.  During the course of this project we will complete these thesauri and compare the performance of the full autoindexing system to human indexers.  If these tests are successful, we will extend thesaurus construction to neurology and neurosurgery developing a merged thesaurus covering the clinical neurosciences.  The expert system will then be integrated into a comprehensive medical information system under development at the University of Pittsburgh.

"INTELLIGENT BIOMEDICAL ASSISTANT The rapid explosion of information and data on biologically important molecules requires powerful computer software to aid scientists with integrating and understanding that information.  As the number, size, and types of on-line information and databases increase, it becomes unreasonable to assume that working scientists will have a full understanding of the organization and contents of these information resources.  The hypothesis of our work in the design and development of an intelligent assistant for molecular biologists is that the technology of knowledge-based systems is sufficiently mature to assist in the discovery and interpretation of information relevant to molecular biological research.  Our long-term goal is to increase the productivity of biomedical scientists by designing, implementing, and providing computer-based intelligent assistants for them.  There are limitless numbers of such assistants that can be built, some of which already exist in some form, ranging from assistants that manage routine activities intelligently (e.g., data collection) to those that assist in creative tasks (such as explaining anomalies and planning experiments).  Creating a uniform, easy to use environment for this broad collection of assistants becomes an essential part of the goal since we can only save scientists' time if they can use the software we provide.  Thus we envision a biochemist's workstation with which scientists can exercise a wide variety of computer-based tools, including specialized assistants, matching algorithms, simulations, and databases.  Specifically, we propose to design and develop a workstation which will function as an Intelligent Biomedical Assistant (IBA) for researchers in molecular biology and genetics.  This IBA will be a highly adaptive and extensible system which will employ techniques from Artificial Intelligence (particularly expert systems and concept learning) which will assist the researcher in model building, experiment planning and hypothesis testing. The IBA will be assembled to assist with structural and functional questions about proteins that bind to DNA.  It will have knowledge of some of the existing software and databases that currently exist to help researchers, and will include basic knowledge of molecular biology in which questions are framed.

"BRAIN RECOVERY IN REVERSIBLE THROMBOTIC STROKE We propose to administer reproducible thrombotic stroke to rats, and to assess histopathologic, rheologic and physiological indicators of tissue status during ischemia and following vascular recanalization by the unique thrombolytic agent, hementin.  Of particular interest is to determine, following the ictus, the time domain for which recanalization can be achieved without inducing hemorrhage from ischemically compromised distal vascular segments. Evidence of postischemic reperfusion injury will be sought in terms of oxygen radical-stimulated tissue edema, neutrophil infiltration and lipid  peroxidation.  The degree of inhibition of these mediators of tissue destruction will be examined following administration of specifically targeted quenching agents, such as the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost, and the enzymatic scavenger of superoxide radical, superoxide dismutase in both the short-lived (in plasma) copper/zinc form and the unique long-lived manganese form.  Inasmuch as these studies encompass thrombotic stroke in the induction phase and its therapy in the recovery phase, as aided by mitigation of several deleterious aspects of reperfusion in metabolically compromise brain tissue, clinically relevant information may result.  Our models of thrombotic stroke are mediated by photoexcitation of intravenously injected rose bengal dye, either by argon ion laser irradiation of the middle cerebral artery, or by xenon arc lamp irradiation of the exposed, translucent skull and the underlying cortical microvasculature.  Occlusion(s) appear in as white thrombi containing agglutinated platelets in response to photochemically damaged endothelium.  Following hementin-induced recanalization at clinically relevant times (less than 6 hours following the ictus), edema will be assayed as brain water content, blood flow by the 14C-iodoantipyrine technique, metabolic status by oxygen tension, potassium ion activity and hydrogen clearance, lipid peroxidation by Schiff-base autofluorescence or conjugated dienes, and neutrophil content by antimyeloperoxidase staining, and fluorescent antibody or indium labeling.  In terms of these indicators of reperfusion injury, the ameliorating effect of the antioxidative and antineutrophil agents will also be assessed.

"OBJECT-ORIENTED SIMULATION OF HIV- AND CNS/HIV INFECTION OBJECT-ORIENTED SIMULATION OF HIV-AND CNS/HIV-INFECTION.  Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is the ultimate consequence of a multi-faceted disease process caused by infection with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).  Due to a selective tropism of HIV for the cluster designation 4 (CD4) receptor population, infection involves both the immune system and the nervous system.  Progressively evolving degenerate conditions in both systems render the host increasingly susceptible to ""opportunistic"" infections, with a high mortality rate.  Previous clinical studies have indicated that at least three critical events are involved in the pathogenesis of AIDS.  The first is viral infection of helper T lymphocytes and monocytes early in the course of the disease, the second is the contribution of inductive signals from both cell types to disease progression, and the third is the transport of HIV into the brain by infected monocytes.  These observations lead us to pose two questions: (1) how does the dynamics of HIV-infection depend on the dynamics of communication between these central cell-types and, (2) how can selective, i.e. local, changes in this dynamics cause a global alteration of immune function?  We will approach these question by studying helper T cell-macrophage interaction and the resulting cytokine production as well as stress-related immunomodulation in the context of a novel computer- experimental system that we developed previously.  This system allows the prediction of long-term behavior in the normal and diseased immune system.  We will specifically evaluate the production of cytokines Interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-5, Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Neuroleukin (NLK) and Interferon gamma (y-IFN) associated with a single infection (HIV), multiple infections (HIV + other antigens) and neurological stressors.  These experiments are designed to distinguish between reversible and irreversible effects of a progressive regulatory disease leading to a degenerative disease in distributed cellular systems.

"CAD/CAM FOR DENTAL RESTORATIONS The specific aim of the activities described in this proposal is to create a CAD/CAM system capable of automating the currently practiced restoration fabrication techniques from impression through final restoration.   Methodology required for system development capitalizes on recent technologic advances in robotics, three-dimensional vision systems, stereophotogrammetry, computer graphics, and computer integrated engineering.  The restorations produced by this technique will be of equivalent or enhanced quality compared with those produced by traditional impression - lost-wax techniques. The first priority is to create a single metal crown.  The quality of crowns produced by the automated CAD/CAM systems will be determined using both analytic and clinical criteria.  The analytic criteria include measurement of marginal, interproximal, and occlusal fit; measurement of surface finish with stylus profilometers; and evaluation of product integrity through both scanning electron and dispersive x-ray analysis.  The clinical tests are based on criteria routinely used at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry and include evaluation in (1) a preclinical setting on Bureau of Standard dies and green teeth and (2) actual clinical evaluation with annual followup for at least the duration of the grant funding period to establish long-term stability and tissue response.  Complementing these activities, are two additional aims:  (1) investigations into materials and (2) system enhancement. Materials investigations includes (a) identification of the availability and feasibility of using tooth-colored materials, (b) identification of alternative materials that can be milled but historically have not been used for dental restorations because they could not be cast, and (c) alternative preparation designs that capitalize on material properties identified in step (b) above. System enhancement includes (a) adding the capability of producing partial coverage crowns, inlays, and bridges; (b) developing a clinically usable high-precision customized machining system; and (c) optimizing data acquisition and image processing.  A CAD/CAM system for dental restorations offers a number of potential advantages including opening the possibility of new, stronger materials and the opportunity of creating the equivalent of cast restorations in a single appointment, eliminating the potential of tissue involvement caused by temporary crowns.

"THEORETICAL STUDIES OF MACROMOLECULES We will carry out calculations in four main areas.  First, we describe a pattern-matching approach to prediction of protein secondary structure. This program can be coupled to the tertiary packing algorithms of Cohen et.al. to produce protein-like structures.  In the best case with proteins that have been studied crystallographically, discrepancies of ca. 4 angstroms are observed.  Methods of reducing these errors are evaluated. Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.  Third, we wish to extend our docking calculations to macromolecular interactions and to systematic structural comparison of sets of bioactive compounds.  Fourth, methods are discussed to evaluate the potential functions used in molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics.

"COMPUTER SIMULATION STUDIES OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE In-vivo studies of the menstrual cycle present enormous challenges, as they deal with a complex entity which is the result of multiple interactions between a large number of variables, not all of which can be controlled at one time in an in-vivo setting. Adjunct or alternative approaches to the in-vivo study of the human reproductive cycle have been suggested, among which is the computer simulation approach.  This research proposal represents an attempt to evaluate the validity of this approach. The investigators propose to resume their studies with a computer model of the cyclic morphological and endocrine changes which characterize the menstrual cycle.  The proposal contains three practical aims.  The first aim is to refine the original menstrual cycle computer simulation model. This model was developed more than a decade ago; new data and concepts must now be evaluated, tested and, where required, integrated into the model.  The second aim is to develop a sophisticated user interface.  The model will be adapted to PC desktop type computer hardware and will incorporate principles of what are called ""expert system"" programs.  This will allow physiologists to test and use the computer model in a highly sophisticated, yet easily controllable fashion without the need for an extensive computer background.  The third aim is to test the utility of this computer modeling approach in an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an experimental setting.  Selected experimentalists will provide us with an objective analysis of the model through their ability to log simulation results.  Ultimately, a refined and validated model of the menstrual cycle can be used to assist in both experimental design and result interpretation and thereby enhance knowledge gained from in-vivo experimentation.
