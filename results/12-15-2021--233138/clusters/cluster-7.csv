"LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT This project has three aims.  The first is development, refinement, and testing of an explicit theory of language acquisition in children.  The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSIS IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN I propose to continue my explorations of parallel distributed processing models of cognitive processes.  These models are based on the idea that information processing activity grows out of the interactions of large numbers of simple processing units, and that learning is based on the adjustment of the strengths of the connections among the units.  The work is aimed primarily at modeling psychological phenomena in a computationally adequate way, though it draws its inspiration from and is ultimately applicable to our developing understanding of how information processing actually takes place in the brain.  Two main areas of research are described, one in the area of language processing and one in the area of network learning mechanisms.  In the area of language processing, I plan to carry out a series of studies on sentence comprehension designed to test and elaborate three basic principles of language understanding, and to develop a simulation model based on these principles.  In the area of network learning mechanisms, I describe a new network learning algorithm, and describe plans to try to bring the further development of this and related algorithms together with neurophysiological investigations of a) adaptation to changes in environmental input and b) of the laws that govern synaptic change as studied through experiments on long-term potentiation.

"LANGUAGE LEARNING AND LANGUAGE INPUT The purpose of the program of research outlined in this grant proposal is to determine how child and adult language learners use the linguistic environment in acquiring the formal structure of a language.  The relation between linguistic input and learning will be investigated in two major areas.  The first area concerns the nature and role of linguistic feedback in first language acquisition: what type of feedback exists naturally; what type of feedback, when used experimentally, accelerates acquisition? The second area concerns how beginning learners, whether they are two-year-olds acquiring their native language or adults acquiring an artificial language, map out the basic pattern of a language.  The project will investigate the roles played by two different variables:  very high-frequency syntactic markers, and reference.  A variety of methods and a range of subject populations will be utilized.  Computer-assisted analysis of natural conversations between two-year-olds and their mothers will be used to investigate whether parents supply children with linguistically useful replies.  A training study will investigate experimentally the facilitating effects of different kinds of feedback on two- years-olds' acquisition of questions; a similar study will investigate different types of feedback to adults learning an artificial language.  Experimental studies of artificial language learning with older children and adults, investigating the role of reference and syntactic markers, will be performed.  Computer modeling of adult language learning will be used to examine different hypotheses of how adult and child learning of phrases occurs.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop a theory of language learning which will specify just how learners utilize environmental cues.  Our work should have implications for learning theory within language, and should also have implications for how to accelerate acquisition among the language-delayed and among second-language learners.
