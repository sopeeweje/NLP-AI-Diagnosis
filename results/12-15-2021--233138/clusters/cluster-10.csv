"GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION IN THE AEDES ALBOPICTUS SUBGROUP The specific aims of the proposed research are to analyze genetic differentiation between 6 species in the Aedes albopictus subgroup and to genetically characterize geographic variation in the widespread species, A. albopictus.  The Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus subgroup consists of 11 species of which A. albopictus is the most important.  It is a vector of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever in southeast Asia.  Its wide distribution extends from Madagascar to Hawaii.  In recent years it has extended its range to Guam, the south Pacific and has even been reported in light traps in Memphis, TN.  Surprisingly, little work has been done on the genetics of this or other related species in the subgroup.  The proposed research will help bridge this gap.  The long term objectives are to utilize the genetic characterization of A. albopictus populations as well as certain related species in the subgroup to evaluate their potential to serve as efficient vectors of dengue fever. The proposed genetic studies will provide the necessary foundation for future analyses on genetics of dengue transmission and competence of species and strains to transmit the disease.  The specific aims, to characterize genetic variation within A. albopictus and between species in the albopictus subgroup, will be accomplished through four different types of analyses.  Indirect measures of genetic divergence will be obtained through:  1) experimental hybridization with data collected on insemination, embryonation and egg hatch rates and on the viability of hybrid and backcross progeny, and 2) mate choice tests using species pairs in a series of replicates designed to produce indices of sexual isolation.  Direct measures of genetic divergence will be obtained from analyses of chromosome differentiation and electrophoretic detection of enzyme variability.  Chromosome differentiation will be examined through a series of studies including Giemsa C-banding to localize heterochromatin, meiotic analysis of hybrids and electrophoretically derived linkage map comparisons to determine the presence of inversions, translocations and deletions or duplications, and cytophotometric analysis of nuclear DNA content.  UPGMA clustering and principal component analysis of allele frequency data obtained from allozyme studies will be used to differentiate populations into subsets.  If certain diagnostic alleles, loci or discrete allelic frequency differences or chromosomal variants exist among geographic strains of A. albopictus from dengue epidemic versus non-epidemic areas, vector competence may become effectively marked.

"GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION IN  AEDES ALBOPICTUS Aedes albopictus in an important vector of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fevers.  From its presumed origin in southeast Asia, it has expanded its range from Madagascar to Hawaii.  It was introduced into the continental United States last year and rapidly colonized 12 states posing a serious public health threat.  The specific aims of the states posing a serious public health threat. The specific aims of the proposed project are to evaluate the vector competence for dengue fever of geographic strains of Aedes albopictus from the U.S. and abroad, determine the origin of U.S.  populations and monitor changes in their breeding structure over time, and characterize genetic variation among populations of Aedes albopictus from throughout its range and between five species in the Aedes albopictus subgroup.  The vector competence will be evaluated by cataloging variation in susceptibility to oral infection, disseminated infection and transmission among various strains, determining the degree to which these factors are under genetic control (their heritability), and if the heritability is found to be high, selecting for dengue refractory and susceptible strains of Ae. albopictus in order to determine the genetic basis of vector competency.  Nuclear DNA amounts, allozymes and restriction maps of mitochondrial DNA will be used to determine origins of U.S. populations and to genetically characterize the same.  UPGMA clustering and principal component analysis of DNA amounts and allele frequency data will be used to differentiate populations into subsets.  Population specific restriction profiles of mitochondrial DNA will provide definitive information on maternal lineage. Information on allozyme differentiation within and among various cities in the U.S. over the five year period will provide insight into the dynamics of gene frequency changes that accompany colonization by Ae. albopictus.  Molecular changes in genome organization and repetitive DNA fraction among various strains of Ae. albopictus and the four other subgroup species will be analysed through CoT curve analysis and cloning of satellite and rapidly reassociating DNA respectively.  Chromosomal and reproductive differentiation will be assayed through studies of somatic and meiotic chromosomes and experimental hybridization.  The long-term objectives are to utilize the genetic characterization of Ae. albopictus populations and four related species to determine the genetic basis of their vector competence to dengue, to understand the reasons for the rapid spread and to help design effective strategies for the containment/management of the species in U.S.  ",GENETIC DIFFERENTIATION IN  AEDES ALBOPICTUS,3131569,R01AI021443,"['dengue ', ' gel electrophoresis ', ' mitochondrial DNA ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' United States ', ' Asia ', ' geographic site ', ' genetic crossing over ', ' animal population genetics ', ' gene frequency ', ' chromosome translocation ', ' chromosome inversion ', ' chromosome aberrations ', ' karyotype ', ' alleles ', ' chromatin ', ' centromere ', ' chromosomes ', ' genome ', ' molecular cloning ', ' molecular genetics ', ' genetic mapping ', ' enzymes ', ' disease vectors ', ' disease outbreaks ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' communicable disease control ', ' hybrid cells ', ' meiosis ', ' species difference ', ' genetic strain ', ' biological polymorphism ', ' ']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,1987,142262,0.7911075303590541
