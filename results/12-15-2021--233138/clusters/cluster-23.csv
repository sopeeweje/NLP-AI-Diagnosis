"RECOVERING A DENSITY FROM INCOMPLETE TOMOGRAPHIC DATA The proposed research is in the field of tomography and has direct relevence for the uses of X-ray and other radiation in clinical diagnostic medicine.  The goal of the research is to discover and implement an effective computer algorithm to recover the density of the part of the body outside of a specified region from tomographic data (line integrals) from X-ray beams that do not pass through that region.  The same question will be studied for the plane integrals that are tomographic data gotten in one type of nuclear magnetic resonance zeugmatography.  Each algorithm will be tested on mathematical phantoms and medical data.  There are a number of compelling medical reasons for such an algorithm. For example, the beating heart creates error in regular chest tomograms, and bone or metal pins can create error in tomograms.  It is important to be able to get good tomographic reconstructions of the organs around these regions.  The way to do this is to develop the proposed algorithm.  Two methods of solution are proposed, one of which is based on the singular value decomposition of Professor Quinto.  Preliminary refinements are described that demonstrate the good potential of this method.

"NEUTROPHIL AND ENDOTHELIAL/EPITHELIAL CELL INTERACTIONS Inflammatory reactions in the airways involve emigration of neutrophils across the blood vessel endothelium and then across the pulmonary epithelium.  It is hypothesized that this inflammatory cell accumulation can lead to altered airway reactivity.  Stimulated neutrophils can produce epithelial injury and/or increased permeability which may provide better access for antigens, mediators, and/or irritants to neuronal and/or humoral trigger mechanisms in the airway.  In this project we will examine the mechanisms involved in four aspects of neutrophils emigration and epithelial injury:  (1) adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium, (2) transendothelial migration, (3) transepithelial migration, and (4) epithelial injury by neutrophils activated on the apical side of the epithelium.  We will used cell culture techniques to study endothelial cells from large vessels and from the microvasculature and epithelial cells from alveoli and large airways.  For many of the studies we will use human neutrophils and human endothelial and epithelial cells.  Adherence will be assayed with radiolabeled neutrophils and with video microscopy with computer assisted image analysis.  Migration will be studied in standard chemotactic chambers and in specially designed horizontal and vertical chambers for measurement of bioelectric properties of the monolayers and their permeability.  Questions to be addressed include the following:   Are there specific sites or macromolecules on endothelial cells or epithelial cells to which neutrophils attach?  Do endothelial cells or epithelial cells produce factors which increase or decrease adherence?  Do neutrophils alter the barrier properties of endothelial and epithelial monolayers during migration?  Our central hypothesis is that endothelial cells and epithelial cells play an active role in neutrophil emigration,and once we know the mechanism for this facilitated movement, new pharmacologic strategies for control of inflammation may be possible.  The mechanism of neutrophil adherence and migration should also be applicable to other inflammatory lung diseases such as pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome.

"DENTAL DEMAND AND PUBLIC ORAL HEALTH Dental disease is a serious public health problem affecting all age groups, yet only 41 to 50 percent of Americans visit the dentist each year. Increasing dental demand to improve public oral health requires an understanding of the factors governing demand, but this knowledge base is incomplete.  Relatively little is known about how providers affect dental demand, and models of dental service use have not been tested fully.  The study's purpose is to close these knowledge gaps regarding the process and determinants of dental demand through the following aims:  (1) to determine the effect of providers on dental demand and (2) to determine factor-level effects in a model of dental service use and expenditure.  Subjects will be local dentists and 4,207 sampled Washington Education Association members and their dependents who are covered by Washington Dental Service (Delta Dental Plan).  Data sources are WDS/WEA dental claims, a dentist mail survey and a telephone survey of WEA insureds.  In Aim 1, OLS will be used to estimate provider effects on patient demand within sampled dental practices.  In Aim 2, principal component analysis and OLS will be used to estimate additive, factor-level effects on dental demand among WEA insureds.  Confirmatory factor analysis will be used to test causal models of dental demand.  Study results should lead to both patient and provider interventions for improving public oral health.

"SIGNAL ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS IN CARDIAC MAPPING Mapping of cardiac potentials and activation sequences by recording simultaneously from many electrodes applied directly to the heart promises to be a powerful tool for the study and treatment of arrhythmias.  Several major improvements in mapping must be made if it is to fulfill this promise.  The goal of this application is to perform the research and development necessary to bring about these improvements.  1. A computer- assisted mapping system will be constructed capable of recording from 512 channels simultaneously at an effective sampling rate of 15,000 Hz.  Such a system is needed to map the complex activation sequences and high-frequency Purkinje spikes that can occur during some arrhythmias.  2. Improved methods will be developed to construct electrodes reliably, accurately, quickly, inexpensively, and in large numbers using microelectronic techniques.  3. Fast, accurate methods will be developed to specify the three-dimensional location of epicardial, intracavitary, and plunge electrodes for animal mapping. Computer graphics will be developed to display activation sequences as lines for the endocardium and epicardium or as surfaces in a three-dimensional representation of the thickness of the ventricular wall within seconds of recording the potentials. The lines or surfaces will be animated to move through the heart with time as in a movie.  4.  Robust, quantitative algorithms for detection of the presence and timing of activation from electrode recordings will be developed and will be implemented in software to perform rapidly and with a minimum of human intervention. The data to develop these algorithms will be obtained from experiments in which the presence or absence of activation is known by means independent of the electrode recordings.  5. Experiments will be performed to determine the anatomic and electrical causes of fractionated potentials in cardiac electrode recordings, i.e., cases in which a single, discrete activation complex is not recorded.  6. Methods will be developed to estimate potentials away from the recording electrode sites in those regions in which it is not possible to place electrodes. Examples include estimating endocardial potentials from intracavitary recordings, epicardial potentials from recording from the overlying epicardial fat, and potentials through the ventricular wall from intracavitary and epicardial recordings. The accomplishment of these goals will greatly improve cardiac mapping and should lead to new advances in both the basic understanding and the clinical treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.

"UNIS--A NURSING EXPERT SYSTEM FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE The specific aim of this research is to determine the effects of UNIS, a nursing expert system, on the nursing care of patients with urinary incontinence in a nursing home. UNIS was designed to increase a person's knowledge of urinary incontinence and to improve the quantity and quality of careplans generated for the assessment and treatment of patients. Urinary incontinence is a major problem for the elderly, particularly in the nursing home. Providing expert nurse consultations with UNIS could offer a new technological approach to meeting the existing knowledge deficits of professional caregivers to those with urinary incontinence.  Two parallel studies will be performed with incontinent patients and nurse caregivers. The frequency of incontinent episodes, the nurse;s knowledge and careplan development will be measured repeatedly throughout the study. The acceptability of the system by nurses will be surveyed. consultations with UNIS will be monitored.  The long term objective of this project is to explore the potential for developing expert system application in several areas of the nursing home. the integration of expert systems in a nursing home information system could provide cost effective ongoing expert consultation for nurses and other health care personnel, administrators and state and federal reviewers.
