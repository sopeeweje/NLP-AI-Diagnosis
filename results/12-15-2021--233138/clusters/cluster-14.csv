"QUANTITATIVE GAIT ANALYSIS Quantitative gait analysis using computer aided videomotion analysis, force plates and electromyography is of recognized value in assessment of gait disabilities and in quantitative evaluation of treatment.  But, despite dramatic improvements in techniques, gait analysis still lacks widespread clinical utility because of uncertainties relating to data selection, manipulation, and analysis.  Since data acquisition is usually limited to a single test session over several gait cycles, one vital problem concerns selection of a gait cycle for analysis that is representative of the patient's gait and determination of its reliability as a basis for clinical decision making.  Another problem relates to the manipulation of large quantities of data generated by measurements of various kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters over several gait cycles to detect clinically significant patterns of performance.  This process is further complicated by the fact that gait patterns vary among patients with the same syndorme and to a certain extent, vary even among normals. Interpretration may be simplified by using statistical pattern recognition techniques, but for a pattern recognition approach to be successful, the enormous quantity of data must be reduced to a parsimonious set of features which describe gait patterns accurately.  Furthermore, representation of graphic patterns associated with various gait parameters in terms of a discrete set of variables would make numerical comparison more meaningful.  The first part of this study will investigate repeatability and clinical reliability of selected kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters obtained from repeated gait analyses on normal subjects and two representative groups of orthopaedic patients, using a statistical criterion (variance ratio).  The feasibility of using the variance ratio as a criterion for averaging gait cycles to yield a representative cycle also will be examined.  The second part of the study will deal with the application of principal component analysis for representing gait patterns in a concise manner, as an initial step to application of pattern recognition techniques.  The effectiveness of the derived features in representing gait abnormalities will be evaluated using the same normal and orthopaedic patient subjects.  It is anticipated that the results of the proposed study will enhance the clinical effectiveness of quantitative gait analysis by defining practical computer algorithms for selecting and assessing reliability of raw gait data, and by defining techniques for feature selection that can be used effectively in pattern recognition techniques.

"DEVELOPMENT OF A GAIT PATHOLOGY EXPERT SYSTEM The goal of this project is to develop a knowledge-based (expert) system which identifies the cause of a patient's gait dysfunction from an analysis of basic gait data.  The intent is to assist the clinician by providing the primary and secondary diagnosis, with an explanation of the underlying reasoning process.  Specifically this involves:  1) design and development of an automated Data Analysis Expert System (DA/ES), or preprocessor, which will analyze and evaluate the raw data obtained from instruments and yield judgments relating the specific data set to the parameters of normal walking; 2) design and evaluation of a Gait Pathology Expert System (GP/ES), which uses the outputs from the DA/ES and a gait analysis knowledge base to identify the muscular dysfunction responsible for the observed deviations from normal gait; and 3) making preliminary plans for the establishment of a National Resource Center to disseminate the results of this project.  Difficulties in walking experienced by cerebral palsy, head trauma, and stroke related to abnormal muscle control.  Surgery can significantly improve function if the abnormal muscle activity can be isolated from normal performance.  Clinical testing is woefully imprecise; comprehensive gait analysis is a critical factor in making an appropriate surgical plan.  Problems in interpreting the data have limited the number of clinical gait laboratories, in spite of the enormous clinical need (in CP alone, the existing population approximates 240,000, with about 6,000 new patients each year).  The ultimate goal of developing a National Resource Center to disseminate the results of this project will greatly expand the number of clinical facilities able to provide automated gait interpretation.  The strong clinical focus of this effort will be based upon the knowledge of, and verified by, well-known experts in gait analysis.  Gait analysis knowledge is uniquely suited for organization into a ""frame""-based expert system.  The team assembled for this development is well-qualified for work in this area of artificial intelligence.  The proposed knowledge-based system is unique because it 1) has a strong clinical basis, 2) automatically interprets the four most significant types of data (foot-switch, EMG, Motion, and Force) to yield the most probable diagnosis of the patient's gait dysfunction, and 3) provides a thorough explanation of its reasoning process.
