"ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM FOR CANCER THERAPY The goal of this program is to design, develop, and evaluate a state-of-the-art system for ultrasonically inducing local hyperthermia in humans for use in cancer therapy.  The program is composed to several interconnected subgoals which are:  1) To continue development of existing computer programs used for transducer design and beam pattern evaluation, thermal exposure calculations and resulting temperature distributions.  2) To design and evaluate ultrasound transducers that are optimised for inducing hyperthermia.  3) Install transducers with appropriate power supplies and controllers in a modified diagnostic ultrasound scanner.  The central unit is a commercial OCTOSON digital ultrasound imaging system.  We will add a number of additional heating transducers to the gantry in out-rigger fashion.  Each transducer will be separately driven by its own power amplifier and driver.  The drivers will be driven by a micro-processor based control unit.  Temperatures at varius important sites within the patient will be measured with thermocouples or other devices and made available to the operator and to the control unit by means of a data acquisition system.  4) Design and install a hardware and software link between temperature monitoring devices on subjects and the microprocessor controllers within the imager for the purpose of automating the delivery of thermal dose.  5) Evaluate the system with phantoms.  6) Evaluate the system with animals.  The purpose of the animal studies will be two-fold: a) determine whether focused ultrasound can be effectively delivered to deep seated abdominal masses without excessive heating of adjacent critical normal organs.  b) Determine initial antitumor effects and normal tissue toxicities resulting from such treatment in pet animals with spontaneous tumors, i.e. Phase I/II Preclinical Trials.  The animal portion of this project has been planned to solve the technical problems of safely and effectively heating deep seated abdominal tumors with focused ultrasound. 7) Evaluate the system with humans.  a) Evaluate ability of the proposed system to achieve prescribed thermal distributions in human tumors, b) evaluate toxicity associated with the proposed ultrasound hyperthermia technique, c) compare the thermal distributions and temperature patterns achieved with the proposed device to those achieved with other hyperthermia devices, d) evaluate the imaging capability of the device, e) evaluate tumor response rates and duration of response rates and duration of response.

"MICROWAVE PHASED ARRAY FOR HYPERTHERMIA CANCER THERAPY The goal of this project is to develop a prototype microwave phased array applicator for local tumor hyperthermia therapy.  The therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation therapy can be improved by the focused application of heat to the tumor.  The use of microwaves for the generation of local hyperthermia has been successfully applied in both animal and clinical studies.  However, current designs for microwave applicators heat only superficial tumors and must be mechanically moved in order to change the power distribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues.  The specific aims of the proposed Phase I study are designed to develop new techniques for producing local tumor hyperthermia using microwaves. Preliminary studies have resulted in a new design for a microwave phased array hyperthermia applicator.  The proposed Phase I studies will allow development of this existing design into a working prototype microwave hyperthermia applicator system.  This applicator system will consist of a microwave phased array applicator, a microwave power amplifier and distribution network, and a computer control system for the applicator. This new microwave phased array applicator system will have the capability of focusing microwave energy more effectively in tissue than presently available clinical devices and the location of the focus will be electronically rather than mechanically scanned in order to produce a uniform tumor temperature distribution without overheating surrounding normal tissues.  The results of the Phase I studies will provide a basis for human clinical trials of combined radiation and hyperthermia therapy.

"ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM FOR CANCER THERAPY Hyperthermia has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of many tumors despite the limited capabilities of the available heating technologies, which have been constrained by the short history of modern clinical hyperthermia.  One developing, non- invasive heating technology with the potential to tailor power deposition patterns to individual tumors and to allow multipoint temperature control is scanned, focussed ultrasound.  We have developed such a system and propose (1) to perform phase 1 studies involving human tumors at a variety of locations to determine which tumors and sites can be effectively treated by this modality, (2) to develop a computerized treatment planning system to allow the ultrasound scanning pattern to be individualized and optimized for each patient, (3) to extend our current, single point feedback control system to a multipoint controller to give improved control over tumor temperature distributions, and (4) to perform animal experiments to obtain important knowledge concerning the interactions between ultrasound and normal and tumor tissues.  The clinical studies will investigate the temperature distributions in different tumors and locations as a function of our system parameters (transducer choice, feedback algorithm, scanning speed and pattern), and the limitations of scanned focussed ultrasound imposed by pain and other normal tissue toxicity, abdominal gas, tissue inhomogeneities and interfaces, and the available utltrasonic treatment window.  The treatment planning approach will use serial CT scans of the patient, pretreatment measurements of the tumor blood perfusion values and ultrasonic absorption coefficients, and computerized treatment simulations.  The multipoint feedback control system will utilize the know locations of the temperature sensors to vary power as a function of position.  The animal studies will investigate the possible utilization of nonlinear effects (including a determination of potential cavitation problems), the in vivo absorption coefficients in different tissues, the distortion of the high power ultrasound beam while passing through multiple tissues, and the power deposition at soft tissuebone and-gas interfaces.  These studies will give a scientific basis for the improved design and application of scanned focussed ultrasound.
