"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY The specific aim of the proposed research is to continue to develop the analytical capability of 252Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry for biomedical research involving large biomolecules (m/z greater than 5000). Part of the plan is to change the method of sample preparation so that the formation of molecular ions from the substrate will be less dependent on matrix effects and at the same time will improve sensitivity to the picomole level.  The new method of sample preparation will utilize adsorption of proteins (insulin and cytochrome-C) onto polymeric surfaces from liquid solutions.  The interaction will be analyzed using phase equilibrium thermodynamics to evaluate equilibrium constants, DeltaH, and DeltaS for adsorption.  These same surfaces will become samples for 252Cf-PDMS analysis.  Fractional coverage will be determined by 252Cf-PDMS.  A general study of polymer-protein surface thermodynamics will be carried out using 252Cf-PDMS as an analytical method.  Two important protein systems, interferon and hemoglobin, have been targeted as the next model compounds for extending the mass range and capabilities of 252Cf-PDMS.  Some feasibility studies will be carried out to determine whether 252Cf-PDMS might be used to study antibody-antigen interactions and receptor sites on cell surfaces.  The studies of protein-polymer interactions have relevance to the genesis of atherosclerosis.  Specific interactions between proteins and receptor sites are fundamental to the immune response in humans and in understanding the role of proteins such as insulin in triggering a response within a cell when it attaches to a receptor site.

"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY Biopolymers are key components of living organisms.  The use of 252-Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry (252Cf-PDMS) to improve their characterization and detection and study chemical activity can have a significant impact on elucidating structure-function, early detection of disease and the question of biocompatibility of organic implants.  One of the long term objectives of the proposed research is to develop 252Cf-PDMS to the level where it is routinely used for obtaining molecular weights of biomolecules in the molecular weight range from 1000-100,000 u with unit accuracy and pmol sensitivity.  A second long term objective is to develop the use of modified surfaces for selective adsorption as a new dimension in analytical biomedical mass spectrometry.  A third long term objective is to better utilize the fragmentation patterns inherent in the 252Cf-PD mass spectra of biopolymers to determine their sequence.  An additional long term objective is to use 252Cf- PDMS to study plasma protein adsorption on biocompatible surfaces. One of the specific aims of the proposed research is to improve the current 252Cf-PD TOF technology for obtaining mass spectra of high molecular weight species.  A second specific aim is to explore the use of different surfaces to selectively adsorb proteins and polyanionic biopolymers from aqueous solution in a manner that they can be readily desorbed as molecular ions in vacuum.  A third specific aim is to develop a protocol for studying protein adsorption on different polymer substrates with the objective of addressing the question of biocompatibility.  The experimental design and methods for accomplishing the first of the long range objectives and specific aims include the development of a new detector that will give enhanced sensitivity for high molecular weight ions, and the use of energy selection and pulsed fields for background reduction.  For the utilization of surfaces for selective adsorption, four systems for surface modification will be studied.  The first is based on the use of silanol chemistry on thin Si wafers.  The second is based on surface modification of polyethylene terephthalate.  The third is based on the electrochemical doping of electropolymerized poly-3-methyl- thiophene.  For studying protein adsorption and biocompatibility, albumin and fibrinogen will be used as model plasma proteins.  Thin films of different polymers will be prepared by spin casting and a combination of direct protein analysis and 252Cf-PDMS will be used to study the biocompatibility problem.
