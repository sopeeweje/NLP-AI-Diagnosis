"Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia:  Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging Dementia represents a major public health problem which will grow significantly with the aging of our society. Recently, multiple pieces of converging clinical and neuropathological data indicate that dementia is typically a multi-factorial process. This evolution in thinking about the biology of dementia comes at a time when the most significant recent development in dementia imaging has been the introduction of amyloid plaque labeling compounds; the most widely studied at this point is Pittsburgh Compound - B (PiB). A central principle underlying this renewal is this. Amyloid imaging is unquestionably a major advance. However, since the biology of dementia is more complex than brain amyloidosis alone, imaging of dementia is more complex than brain amyloid imaging alone. Our primary goal in this renewal is to use various imaging modalities to identify different mechanisms underlying dementia. This is the first resubmission of a competitive renewal of AG11378. We have revised the grant in accordance with each point raised in the critique and we believe this has resulted in a much stronger application. Each of the five aims is cast to answer variations on the questions: What is the contribution of specific imaging-based proxies of pathology to clinical/cognitive decline? When in the course of the disease do these relationships hold true? For whom is this true? Where in the brain are the relevant pathologies expressed? Principle outcome measures will be clinical and psychometric decline over time which we will use as indicators of disease progression. Our predictor variables will include various imaging modalities which will serve as proxies for specific pathologic mechanisms underlying dementia. PiB will serve as a measure of plaque burden and we will use various Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities to assess cerebro- vascular disease, tissue loss, tissue perfusion, diffusion, neuronal integrity, and inflammation. Features that distinguish this renewal from past cycles of AG11378 include a mechanistic focus, multi- modality imaging including multiple MRI modalities as well as PET amyloid imaging, MR imaging now at 3T, inclusion of both amnestic and non-amnestic MCI, and voxel-based analytic methods including an exciting new computational approach which employs a support vector machine algorithm to provide diagnosis in individual subjects. In addition, subjects will now be recruited from a new population-based study of aging and dementia, which differentiates this renewal from past cycles as well as from most dementia imaging studies which recruit from referral practices and thus risk sampling bias. Previous cycles of this grant have contributed significantly to recognition of the utility of imaging in dementia. An active debate is currently underway about revising clinical criteria for AD, specifically whether imaging and fluid biomarker information should be included among the criteria. Results from this renewal grant will inform this debate about multiple time dependent mechanisms leading to dementia that are accessible in living subjects through imaging. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Identifying Mechanisms of Dementia: Role for MRI in the Era of Molecular Imaging (AG11378) Dementia is a leading public health problem now and will have an increasingly serious impact on public health as the number of elderly individuals increase. Dementia has many possible underlying causes and several different causes are at work in most elderly demented subjects. In this grant, we will use modern brain imaging to identify specific mechanisms underlying progression to dementia.

"AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (01): Behavior, Behavioral Change, and Prevention, and specific Challenge Topic 03-MH-101: Biomarkers in Mental Disorders. Clinically significant depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 86% of nursing home residents [Brodaty01], with substantial under-recognition of the problem and excess morbidity and mortality in individuals with dementia. The sensitivity of current depression detection approaches deteriorates notably with progressive cognitive impairment due to: (i) diminishing ability of demented subjects to communicate affective states, (ii) critical overlap between the neurovegetative symptoms of depression and the neuropsychiatric features of dementia (e.g., apathy), and (iii) the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms in the context of dementia [Bielinski06]. In order to improve the assessment of depression in dementia patients, the NIMH has proposed modifications to the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder that 1) highlight the transient and fluctuating nature of depressive symptoms, 2) addition of social withdrawal and irritability items, and 3) substitution of the anhedonia criterion with ""decreased positive affect or pleasure in response to social contact and usual activities"" [Olin02]. As the subject's ability to report internal affective states diminishes, however, activity and behavioral correlates of depression such as verbal and motor agitation, physical aggression, care resistance, and food/fluid refusal become important markers of possible depression [Bielinski06]. Emerging video, audio and sensor technologies hold promise for quantifying and automating the detection of such activities and behaviors, and thus identifying stages of depression that may be differentially responsive to various prevention and intervention strategies. We propose to overcome the under-diagnosis and failed recognition of symptoms of depression in dementia by applying real-time continuous video and audio recordings in the non-private spaces of a nursing home special care dementia unit (SCU; 16 total beds), as well as sensor recordings (radiofrequency identification tags, motion, contact and pressure sensors) throughout all the SCU spaces to capture the consenting subjects' activities, behaviors and social interaction patterns. Current ""gold standard"" research rating instruments will also be administered to record a detailed account of the cohort's clinical characteristics. The recordings will take place in three two-week waves that are each separated by 3 months. A frame-by-frame annotation of the video recordings by trained coders, as well as the pattern of sensor recordings, will provide training data for computer-based machine learning algorithms that will automate the detection of potential activity and behavioral manifestations to distinguish depressed from non-depressed nursing home residents with cognitive impairment or dementia.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.           Research Narrative The technology developed and applied here may ultimately lead to automated assistance in elder care through more complete and accurate observational records for depression diagnosis and evaluation than possible now with limited staff in long-term care facilities and for elders living alone at home.",AUTOMATED METHODS TO SUPPORT THE DETECTION OF DEPRESSION IN DEMENTIA,7937981,RC1MH090021,"['National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Staging ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' instrument ', ' Records ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Physical aggression ', ' Video Recording ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' Beds ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' pleasure ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Agitation ', ' Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Restlessness ', ' Psychomotor Hyperactivity ', ' Psychomotor Excitement ', ' Psychomotor Agitation ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' neuropsychiatry ', ' neuropsychiatric ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' diagnosis evaluation ', ' radiofrequency ', ' Accounting ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' Affective ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' Computers ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Motor ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Modification ', ' Behavioral ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Anhedonia ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Algorithms ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' DSM-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition ', ' DSM4 ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Measurement ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Motion ', ' ']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,RC1,2010,454869,PA-18,0.04238459732889766

"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.                  The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease.

"First Person Vision for Objective Evaluation of Caregiving Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 40 million family members provide informal care to older individuals annually, making them an essential component of the health care system in the US. Almost 11 million Americans provide unpaid care for a person with Alzheimer's disease or other dementia. Health care professionals typically rely heavily on self-report by family members to understand the dynamics of the caregiving dyad, the quality of caregiving, and the impact of dementia on everyday life. Though invaluable, this information may be devoid of context, or biased due to caregiver reticence or imperfect recall. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to understand the challenges of caregiver/care-recipient interactions, and caregivers' responsiveness to clinicians' suggestions for handling difficult caregiving challenges. Equipped with tiny sensors and worn on eyeglasses or clothing, FPV devices capture video and sound within the user's field of view. These devices can document actual interaction, permit identification of antecedent circumstances or consequences, and provide the basis for targeted intervention designed to assure safe interactions and to prevent, eliminate, or ameliorate distressing care-recipient behaviors. This project with caregiving dyads aims: to describe the feasibility, usability, and interpretability of FPV device use at home (Aim 1); to explore the effect of nurse- delivered intervention, informed by FPV data, on reducing problem behaviors and caregiver burden when delivered in person within 2 weeks (Aim 2) or delivered by phone in ""near real-time,"" that is, within 1 hour, of problem behavior events (Aim 3); and to develop algorithms for an automated system capable of generating real-time Machine Learning responses that promote effective handling of problem behaviors (Aim 4). This project will involve 40 caregiving dyads comprising family caregivers age 21 or older who experience these problem behaviors and care-recipients age 50 or older with moderate to severe dementia (MMSE score <18) due to Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Lewy body dementia, or vascular dementia. Baseline data will include demographic, health, and caregiving information including problem behaviors, functional status, and attitudes toward technology. Caregivers among the first 20 dyads will wear two FPV devices during waking hours over 7 days and signal when the care-recipient takes medications and engages in problematic behavior. Within 2 weeks the caregiver will be shown video clips of his or her FPV data as part of a nurse- delivered intervention focused on handling problem behaviors, then wear the FPV devices for another 7 days and receive brief telephone contact to reinforce the intervention, which we anticipate will reduce problem behaviors and caregiver burden. This pilot intervention study will be replicated with the second 20 dyads, though the nurse will access FPV data remotely and intervene by phone within 1 hour of problem events. FPV data gathered in these investigations will be used to develop algorithms for an innovative, automated tool for objective assessment and timely, tailored intervention aimed at improving caregiving quality and safety.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions. First-person vision (FPV) technology offers a novel approach to providing health care professionals with objective evidence of caregiving quality and responsiveness to recommended strategies for dealing with everyday problem behaviors. This project explores the use of FPV technology to assess specific interactions between caregivers and care-recipients, and it examines how FPV data can inform nurse-delivered intervention and provides the basis for development of an automated, intelligent assessment and intervention tool to reduce problem behaviors and decrease caregiver burden.           Family caregivers often find it difficult to deal with the agitation, resistance, and repetitive behaviors of their family members with moderate or severe dementia, and they frequently ask health care professionals how to handle these difficult interactions.

"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia.

"Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is estimated that neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for these neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage two previously developed technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS). The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be a previously developed Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), a recently developed Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated during a previous NIH-funded SBIR Phase I/II project for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea. The AMP is truly unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real-time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies. With integrated measures of submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements, the Sleep Profiler is an ideal device for quantifying the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), which is considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine-learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of various dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to develop a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud-based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need, Advanced Brain Monitoring (Carlsbad, CA) is developing Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profilers for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS), which will provide an inexpensive, non-invasive solution combining neurocognitive, electrophysiological (EEG, ECG, EMG), and sleep-behavior assessment into a single, integrated system featuring automated scoring and classification algorithms. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of research participants.                ",Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of

"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9164777,R21AG053467,"['interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Free Association ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' Semantic memory ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' contagion ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' memory retrieval ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Categories ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,206644,WI-02,-0.009928408131995614
"MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application of the MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia compares which of 3 approaches for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is best at accurately predicting incident clinical dementia. Of the two primary diagnostic methods currently used, psychometrically defined and clinical determined, application of criteria for psychometrically defined has been most variable. Further, a novel algorithmic method is emerging as an alternative unbiased approach. Using commonly applied clinical tools of cognitive performance and brain structure obtained from baseline and repeat administration of neuropsychological (NP) tests and magnetic imaging resonance (MRI) scans, this proposed project will first determine what profile of cross-sectional or longitudinal neuropsychological tests and threshold performance levels, combined with imaging markers is the most efficacious in predicting progression to dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease. Another set of analyses will test the algorithmic method. The diagnostic models that emerge from these two sets of analyses will then be compared to diagnoses of MCI using standard clinical criteria to determine which of the three methods best predicts incident dementia. The clinical diagnoses of MCI and dementia are available through a separately funded initiative. Also central to this grant proposal is the inclusion of external seasoned investigators, who will provid their expertise in definition and study of MCI and the factors influencing progression to disease. This effort aims to provide enhanced sensitivity in application of NP and MRI tools to detect subtle impairment at an earlier stage on the preclinical continuum and improved specificity in determining the MCI subtypes most highly associated with AD versus other types of dementia. Increased MCI diagnostic accuracy will enhance opportunity for more effective interventions, which have been largely disappointing to date, and could eventually leading to a delay in the onset or prevention of the clinical expression of AD. The MRI, Genetics and Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia seeks to identify the most effective method and criteria for diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that is best predictive of incident Alzheimer's disease. Current efforts to treat AD have been ineffective because intervention occurs too late in the insidious process. The potential public health relevance of this proposed project is increased accuracy of diagnosis at the preclinical stage, where treatment opportunities may prove to be more successful and prevention is most feasible.","MRI, Genetics & Cognitive Precursors of AD and Dementia",9087082,R01AG016495,"['Age ', ' Algorithms ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' cerebral infarct ', ' Cerebral Infarction ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Vascular Dementia ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Health ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Judgment ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neuropsychologic Tests ', ' Neuropsychological Tests ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Reading ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Seasons ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' falls ', ' Specialist ', ' Entorhinal Area ', ' entorhinal cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Genetic ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Diagnostic Technique ', ' Diagnostic Method ', ' Diagnostic Procedure ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Performance ', ' Accuracy of Diagnosis ', ' diagnostic accuracy ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' brain volume ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Impairment ', ' neuropsychological ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' algorithmic methodologies ', ' algorithmic methods ', ' White Matter Hyperintensity ', ' cognitive performance ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2016,634478,MA-07,0.00678485524900502
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9272127,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' blood loss ', ' Bleeding ', ' Hemorrhage ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' cohort ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' advanced dementia ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' imaging biomarker ', ' imaging marker ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2016,1111944,IL-07,0.09703420774244197
"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9222881,K01LM012439,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' rehabilitation technology ', ' rehab technology ', ' usability ', ' multisensory ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' support tools ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' individual patient ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' ']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,168375,OH-07,0.04049256587175242
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias.

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological changes associated with behavior changes to facilitate early intervention through timely alerts to clinicians.",Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place,9339726,K01LM012439,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Couples ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Engineering ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Industry ', ' Learning ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Missouri ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Semantics ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Development Plans ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' instrument ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' instructor ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' data modeling ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Networks ', ' computer based statistical methods ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' aged ', ' rehabilitation technology ', ' rehab technology ', ' usability ', ' multisensory ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' learned behavior ', ' learning behavior ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' support tools ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' dementia care giver ', ' primary caregiver ', ' primary care giver ', ' individual patient ', ' web app ', ' web application ', ' Longitudinal observational study ', ' Longitudinal observation study ', ' ']",NLM,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,170236,OH-07,0.04049256587175242
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9356352,UH2NS100599,"['senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' sharing data ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' clinical imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH2,2017,1102656,IL-07,0.09703420774244197
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9334048,R21AG053467,"['Affect ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Free Association ', ' Huntingtons Disease ', "" Huntington's Disease Pathway "", "" Huntington's Disease "", "" Huntington's "", ' Huntington Chorea ', ' Huntington Disease ', ' Independent Living ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Semantics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Semantic memory ', ' American ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' Performance ', ' contagion ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' memory retrieval ', ' novel ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Disease model ', ' disorder model ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' neurocognitive test ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Data ', ' Retrieval ', ' Cognitive ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' computational tools ', ' computerized tools ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' behavioral impairment ', ' impaired behavior ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,193393,WI-02,-0.009928408131995614

"Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD PROJECT SUMMARY The primary goal of this Administrative Supplement is to study 20 candidate genes, previously not associated with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), in ADRD-relevant experimental models. These genes were identified by machine learning derived from meta-path-based protein knowledge graph integration. ADRD continues to be an intractable age-related neurodegenerative illness in elderly without a cure. Numerous clinical trials have failed in result in effective therapeutic management of ADRD. This unprecedented 99.6% failure rate in drug development targeting ADRD is, in part, due to lack of sufficient consideration of novel molecular pathways and mechanisms besides the ones neuropathologically associated with different dementias. The main thrust of this proposal is to use automated algorithmic network predictions based on the meta-path approach, by providing the integrated database developed at the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) Knowledge Management Center (KMC). Based on 13 distinct datasets totaling over 261 million datapoints, the AD-specific machine learning classifier model identified several key features, such as proteins that mediate inflammatory processes (JAK2, IL10 & IL2), response to oxidative stress (GSTP1), nervous system development (BDNF) and glycolysis (GAPDH). As a preliminary validation, we used human SHSY5Y cells that show robust hyper- phosphorylation of tau at S202 (itself a predictor of neurofibrillary tangle pathology relevant to ADRD) upon inflammatory stimuli (treated with cell supernatant from RAW macrophages). We used individual siRNA knockdown for the 20 predicted candidate genes in SHSY5Y cells prior to RAW macrophage media treatment, and assessed pS202-tau by Cellomics® unbiased high-content microscopy and quantitative morphometry. Four out of 20 candidate genes altered pS202 -tau levels in SHSY5Y cells, thus providing a proof-of-concept validation for the AD machine learning model. Based on this, we hypothesize that the AD-specific model is able to reliably identify novel biological datasets relevant to ADRD. We propose to test this hypothesis under three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve the meta-path machine-learning models and data mine novel associations. In Aim 2, we will perform in vitro biological validation for the top genes predicted by the meta-path approach. In Aim 3, we will build an interactive web platform to disseminate AD-gene associations. Successful completion of these studies will open up new avenues for ADRD research and may lead to novel therapeutic targets for ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the discordance between neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, ADRD, (e.g., amyloid beta pathology) and failed attempts to clinically manage ADRD therapeutically, there is an urgent need to identify novel drug targets. The Knowledge Management Center (KMC) for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program, to which this supplement is linked-to, plans to utilize its integrated database to develop machine learning models that can predict novel disease-protein associations. Specifically, a set of 20 genes not previously associated with ADRD, were predicted using machine learning. Of these, 4 genes show significant biological effects (regulating hyperphosphorylation of tau at S202) in ADRD-relevant cellular models. The goals of this administrative supplement are to enhance machine learning models, to provide biological validation of candidate genes predicted from machine learning, and to propose novel drug ADRD targets.",Machine Learning Model Validation for AD/ADRD,9719312,U24CA224370,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Managing Dementia through a Multisensory Smart Phone Application to Support Aging in Place SUMMARY This proposal is for an NLM sponsored K01 Mentored Career Development Award. The research I propose involves the development of a smart mobile application combined with commercially available sensors, to capture actionable information about behavior pattern changes in both patients with dementia and their primary caregivers. Through continuously collected physiological sensor data, I will build data models that can learn the behavior patterns of both the patient with dementia and his/her caregiver. My research plan involves three stages. The first stage involves instrument validation and generating context-specific ground truth or the baseline for each participating couple. The second stage will involve longitudinal observational study using the system built in the first stage in an assisted living facility. The final stage will involve deploying our system for a longitudinal study in the homes of our participants. This study merges well with my short term goals to learn more about the challenges faced by older adults as they battle physical and cognitive decline. As a computer science researcher, my long term goal is to work on building technologies that allow older couples to live independently in their homes for a longer time, and to have more control over their quality of life. I have experience working in eldercare research as a part of my doctoral studies in University of Missouri's Center for Eldercare and Rehabilitation Technology. I plan to continue working in this field and develop my independent research program that facilitates aging in place through the use of low cost sensors and machine learning analytics. Currently as an Instructor and Research Assistant Professor at Wright State University's Department of Computer Science and Engineering, I have strong mentors both in the technical and clinical areas that will allow me to grow in this highly interdisciplinary area. My career development plan includes coursework, regular meetings with mentors and collaborators, and practical clinical study experience that will facilitate my development of an independent research program that will enrich and improve the lives of older adults for years to come. NARRATIVE With the spread of smartphones and wearable sensors in the fitness industry, there is a great opportunity for personalized digital health, especially for chronic conditions like dementia. As an increasing cohort of older adults suffer from dementia, there arises a strong need to extract relevant patient symptoms collected using sensors to provide actionable information for timely intervention. The objective of this application is to map data collected from physiological sensors with the behavior patterns of persons with dementia, as well as the caregiver to understand the physiological

"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9559291,R44AG059483,"['Age ',

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9558429,R44AG059458,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fire -

"Characterizing Alzheimer's Disease with INSPECDS: Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT  It is estimated that Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia will surpass cancer as the leading cause of death by the year 2040. Alzheimer's is the leading cause of dementia, followed by synucleinopathies, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), Fronto-temporal dementia and Vascular dementia. Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, biomarkers, and treatment options for Alzheimer's disease, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process. To address this unmet need Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) proposes to leverage day and night assessment technologies to create an Integrated Neurocognitive and Sleep-Behavior Profiler for the Endophenotypic Classification of Dementia Subtypes (INSPECDS) to profile Alzheimer's and other dementias. The core components of the INSPECDS platform will be the Alertness and Memory Profiler (AMP), the Sleep Profiler, and integrated machine-learning, classification algorithms, hosted on a secure, cloud-based, infrastructure for automated data processing, analysis, and reporting. The AMP was developed and validated intially for the purpose of detecting the neurocognitive effects of sleep deprivation in adults diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea but has more recently been applied to assess Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The AMP is unique among neurocognitive testing platforms in that it is the only one which integrates advanced, electrophysiological measures (e.g., 24-channel, wireless EEG and ECG) during the performance of computerized neurocognitive tasks and has proven effective in characterizing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's. This advanced capability permits researchers to explore real- time relations between fluctuations in alertness, discrete cognitive functions, and specific neural processes believed to subserve observed performance deficits in Alzheimer's and other dementias. The Sleep Profiler is an FDA-cleared, easily applied, wireless-EEG device that was developed and validated to measure sleep architecture for in-home sleep studies with submental (chin) EMG and wireless accelerometers to monitor head and limb movements to quantify the characteristics of REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD), considered to be a prodromal expression of synucleinopathy. Furthermore, the application of sophisticated, machine- learning, classification algorithms will streamline the processing and analyses of these data to derive statistical probabilities of Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes. The overarching goal of the current, Direct-to-Phase II, SBIR project is to finalize implementation of a secure, cloud-based infrastructure to compile the data obtained from the AMP and Sleep Profiler, train classification algorithms to discriminate among Alzheimer's and other dementia subtypes, validate diagnostic accuracy, and integrate optimized classifiers within the cloud- based architecture. Once completed, the INSPECDS system will be the first clinical research tool of its kind and find immediate application in both university-based research settings and pharmaceutical industry clinical trials to aid in the endophenotypic stratification of Alzheimer's and other dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Among clinical researchers focused on investigating the varying etiologies, genetic associations, clinical course, and treatment options for Alzheimer's and other neurodengenerative diseases, there is an urgent need for effective tools to aid in the classification of dementia subtypes, in the earliest detectable stages of the pathophysiological process.

"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9718452,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Infarction ', ' infarct ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging modality ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' treatment response ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' candidate marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' sharing data ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2018,1165858,IL-07,0.09703420774244197
"Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias ABSTRACT  The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasing worldwide, placing enormous burdens on healthcare providers, patients and caregivers. Many new treatments are in development and the consensus is that most interventions will need to be initiated as early in the disease progression as possible. Advanced Brain Monitoring (ABM) has developed sensitive non-invasive EEG biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's and evaluating treatment outcomes. The biomarkers are in use in drug trials and are being validated longitudinally in a large population of patients with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. Patients with MCI are particularly interesting as potential targets for early intervention as MCI is often a transitional state between normal aging and dementia.  This proposal introduces a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with MCI. The team combines ABM's 15-year success in implementing real-time neuro-sensing and dementia biomarkers with academic and commercial expertise in robot behavioral intervention design. Dr. Maja Mataric, USC Professor, Dr. Cory Kidd, CEO and founder, Catalia Health, and Dr. Schneider, USC Professor, will work with ABM to enable the Mabu robot to interact with participants in their homes and influence healthy habits. Catalia demonstrated that the Mabu software use of artificial intelligence to encourage social interaction improves medical adherence. This project will develop a SAR-mediated intervention for elderly users and MCI patients. Mabu will interact with participants in their homes to encourage and monitor the formation of healthy habits involving physical activity, specifically walking regularly. ABM's mobile EEG sensing systems will be used to assess dementia biomarkers pre- and post-robot intervention and during initial and final human-robot interactions, providing real-time metrics including engagement, workload, stress, and other measures of interactions between human and robot.  The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. The team envisions multi-stage user-robot interactions aimed at: increasing physical activity; enhancing cognitive skills; providing motivation; increasing well-being and improving quality of life. The Phase I focus is on increasing physical activity using the robot as a coach for a small cohort (10 healthy elderly; 10 MCI patients) selected from the ongoing ABM dementia biomarker study. Physical exercise is selected based on the specific evidence that increased activity can delay or slow cognitive decline. The Mabu robot will interact with participants twice daily in their homes for 6-weeks to encourage them to be more active. Project Narrative  This project addresses the worldwide demand for novel intervention approaches to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias introducing a novel, socially assistive robot (SAR) protocol designed with the goal of slowing the progression of cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive impairment. The SAR is envisioned as a complementary approach that will support and enhance any combination of therapeutic interventions for dementia. If successful, the SAR intervention in combination with Advanced Brain Monitoring's objective EEG sleep and daytime dementia biomarkers has the potential to assist patients in living healthier and more productive lives, maintaining independence for longer periods of time, and removing some burden from caregivers.",Interactive Companion Robot for Preventing Neuro-Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's and Other Dementias,9679688,R43AG061994,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cognition ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Medicine ', ' Moods ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' human subject ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Companions ', ' Robot ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' success ', ' professor ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' social ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neurocognitive impairment ', ' neurocognitive decline ', ' IQ Deficit ', ' Neurocognitive Deficit ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' usability ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' normal aging ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' patient population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' cognitive enhancement ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive skill ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' Accelerometer ', ' early detection markers ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' human-robot interaction ', ' ']",NIA,"ADVANCED BRAIN MONITORING, INC.",R43,2018,410550,CA-49,0.08158649998435678
"Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias (ADRD) are now regarded as a public health problem of pressing importance. While the race for disease-altering treatments continues, another strand of work has focused on identifying social and psychological precursors of these conditions. Such biopsychosocial risks often can be traced back to phases of life that predate symptom onset by years or decades. Therefore, a robust social and life course epidemiology of ADRD requires study designs that feature a) broad and deep psychosocial characterization of b) a large, population-relevant cohort c) during early phases of life, with d) medically-documented outcome data. Parent project R01AG053155 features a) through c), specifically in 90,000 members of the Project Talent cohort assessed in 1960 and again in 1970-74. The current supplement expands its scope to all members of Project Talent baseline (roughly 340,000) from 1960, and focuses on two scientific aims. The first seeks to estimate the relative risk of ADRD by the early 70s arising from adolescent personality traits, as documented in Medicare data linked to the cohort. One key feature of this aim is to determine if aspects of personality in adolescence are associated with ADRD incidence in later life independently of adolescent IQ, which is a known predictor. The second key aspect of this aim is to use the size and population representativeness of the sample to derive reasonably precise population-relevant effect size estimates of personality relative risks, and compare these effect sizes to benchmark risk estimates of adolescent IQ and socioeconomic status, which are considered to have policy and public health significance. The second aim also leverages the size and scope of the sample to identify personality traits which may moderate the ADRD risk of low adolescent IQ, in more complex and realistic patterns than can be studied in smaller or less representative data sets. This is accomplished via machine learning methods focused on identifying non-linear interactions via intensive cross-validation, another scientific question that takes full advantage of the size and scope of this unique cohort. Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s related dementias are on the rise, due to both increasing life spans and the size of the Baby Boom generation as it reaches these later years. While scientists have yet to develop cures for dementias, it may be possible to learn how to prevent or delay their onset by studying life circumstances that give rise to these conditions. The goal of this project is to determine how personality traits in adolescence may compensate for the dementia risk posed by low adolescence IQ scores.",Adolescent Personality and the Incidence of Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Related Dementias in Later Life.,9688395,R01AG053155,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Awareness ', ' Baby Booms ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' mortality ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Personality ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Funding ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' exhaustion ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' psychosocial ', ' Deltastab ', ' Predniocil ', ' Prednihexal ', ' Predni-POS ', ' Predni-H ', ' Prednefrin SF ', ' Predcor ', ' Predate ', ' Predalone ', ' Predaject ', ' Pred Mild ', ' Pred Forte ', ' Pred Fort ', ' Ophtho-Tate ', ' Locaseptil-Neo ', ' Key-Pred ', ' Inflanefran ', ' Inf-Oph ', ' Hydrocortancyl ', ' Hexacortone ', ' Econopred ', ' Diopred ', ' Deltacortilen ', ' Balpred ', ' Articulose-50 ', ' Ak-Tate ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer model ', ' AD model ', "" Alzheimer's disease model "", ' parent project ', ' population based ', ' public health priorities ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' High School Student ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' learning strategy ', ' Lifecourse epidemiology ', ' Life course epidemiology ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2018,287001,NY-25,0.042239418466991176
"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9801140,R01AG064529,"['Personality ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Adopted ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cognitive training ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' functional independence ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' behavior adherence ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,554286,FL-05,0.06090471565611883
"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050.

"Developing an integrated virtual assistant (IVA): A tailored behavior tracking and reminder solution to assist persons with dementia and their caregivers Project Summary/Abstract Recent attempts to estimate early stage prevalence of early stage dementia in the United States suggest that as much as 19% of the population over the age of 65 may be living with early stage disease. In early stage, function loss, particularly in the memory domain, significantly impacts instrumental activities of living (IADL) such as responsibility for own medications and scheduling. Solutions are needed that can adapt to the person with dementia and their caregiver through disease progression, tailor the level of support offered based on the changing needs of the dyad, and facilitate more time spent safely aging in place. In this project, an integrated virtual assistant (IVA) will serve as the interface between persons with dementia (PWD), their caregivers, and a suite of smart home technologies to provide aging-in-place support. Our long-term goal is to develop and commercialize IVA, a behavior tracking and reminder solution that will integrate smart home sensors, voice activation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) into an easy-to-use application that provides tailored assistance to PWD and their caregivers as a dyad. The broader impact of these technologies is more time spent safely aging in place, better informed caregivers, and a reduction in caregiver burden and strain.

"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders.

"Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Advances in health care have been dramatic since the beginning of the millennium. As a result, people are living longer with age-related diseases, and the number of older individuals unable to live independently is rising rapidly. Mobile computing offers an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor behavior and use the large amount of collected data to automate analysis of functional health in a person's everyday settings. This project focuses on evaluating the performance and commercial viability of technologies that will meet some of the needs that this coming age wave introduces by automating assessment of a person's functional performance. The primary objective of this Phase I STTR application is to evaluate the feasibility of assessing an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health using behavior patterns as sensed by a smart watch. Achieving this objective will provide a foundation for the Phase II application goal of using multiple information sources to automatically-generate activity scores and functional health measures from sensor data. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach creates a profile of a person's routine behavior through automated real-time recognition of complex activities from mobile sensor data (Aim 1). We will evaluate the use of machine learning techniques to map behavior features onto cognitive and mobility health scores provided through app and in-person neuropsychological assessment (Aim 2). Finally, we will evaluate an interactive visual tool for displaying behavior patterns to provide individuals and their caregivers with insights on their routines and relationship with their health status (Aim 3). This work has important health care implications as functional impairment has been associated with negative outcomes including increased health care utilization, falls, and conversion to dementia. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, it is imperative to commercialize technologies that increase functional independence while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to evaluate the performance and commercial viability of an application that can predict an individual's cognitive and mobility-based health based on patterns that are sensed by a smart watch, and effectively and efficiently present this information to the caregiver. This work will lay the foundation for a commercial tool to analyze behavior routines and automate assessment of functional health. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden, and improve quality of life.",Automated Health Assessment through Mobile Sensing and Machine Learning of Daily Activities,9842127,R41EB029774,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Cognition ', ' Commercial Sectors ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Independent Living ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' falls ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Visual ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' treatment planning ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Modeling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Apple ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' STTR ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' behavioral monitoring ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' commercially viable technology ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' iterative design ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' family support ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' care costs ', ' health assessment ', ' functional independence ', ' supervised learning ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' automated analysis ', ' ']",NIBIB,"ADAPTELLIGENCE, LLC",R41,2019,347739,WA-05,0.035310570731480515
"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors ABSTRACT  The NIA has called for social science and community-based studies to clarify risk and protective factors for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), particularly among racial minorities who are disproportionately affected. Place, including both neighborhood of residence and region/state of birth, has consistently been correlated with ADRD, stroke, and impaired cognitive function. Yet it is unclear whether modifiable mechanisms explain this association, or whether the association is merely due to the selection of unhealthy individuals into poor regions. The goal of this study is to produce the first quasi-experimental evidence to understand the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation on ADRD and its vascular risk factors. We take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on neighborhood effects on ADRD. From 1986 to 1998, the Danish government actively dispersed roughly 76,000 incoming refugees across the country in a nearly randomized (“quasi-random”) fashion to avoid over-crowding in major cities. This cohort includes nearly 12,000 individuals who lived until at least age 60 in Denmark during the 30-year follow-up. Over 90% of families agreed to participate in the program, creating a natural experiment in which these individuals were quasi-randomly assigned to neighborhoods with different levels of deprivation. We will employ unique data spanning over 30 years from Denmark's population and clinical registers, which provide data on sociodemographics, clinical encounters, and prescriptions for all Danish residents. We identify cases of ADRD and its vascular risk factors among this racially diverse cohort via validated techniques using ICD codes and prescription data in clinical registers. We have successfully linked these registers to detailed geocoded data sources on eight measures of neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation. In Aim 1, our goal is to test the hypothesis that neighborhood deprivation increases the incidence of ADRD later in life. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on vascular risk factors for ADRD, including highly prevalent conditions that occur across the life course. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of ADRD and vascular risk factors differs in response to neighborhood deprivation, taking advantage of the large sample size and complete register data available on all subjects. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of neighborhood characteristics on ADRD and vascular risk factors, overcoming the methodological challenges in previous work. This will directly inform the development of clinical, community, and policy strategies to address the neighborhood determinants of ADRD among vulnerable populations who are most at-risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the effects of neighborhood deprivation on Alzheimer's dementia and its vascular risk factors. We will examine the association of specific neighborhood characteristics with Alzheimer's and its risk factors, and we will assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to neighborhood deprivation. This will inform the development of interventions to address the neighborhood factors that affect Alzheimer's disease.",Using a Natural Experiment to Evaluate the Long-Term Effects of Neighborhood Deprivation on Alzheimer's Disease and Vascular Risk Factors,9745267,R01AG063385,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Attention ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Crowding ', ' Data Sources ', ' Denmark ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Methodology ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Socialization ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' forest ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Logistics ', ' Policies ', ' Sample Size ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' member ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' International Classification of Disease Codes ', ' ICD Code ', ' diabetes risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Observational Study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' environmental enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environmental enrichment ', ' environment enrichment for laboratory animals ', ' environment enrichment ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' treatment effect ', ' racial and ethnic ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' alzheimer risk ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial minority ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' clinical development ', ' protective factors ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' dementia risk ', ' risk for dementia ', ' risk factor for\xa0dementia ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,567836,CA-12,0.010045940332645302
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.

"UC Davis Alzheimer's Core Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As reflected in recent budget increases in the National Institutes of Health, and in line with the National Alzheimer’s Project Act, there is a need to enhance and leverage resources to decrease dementia disparities and change the trajectory of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. To fill this gap, we seek to enhance the University of California Davis Alzheimer’s Disease Center (UCD ADC), which contains a diverse ethnoracial cohort (having Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic White decedents), through implementation of digital pathology within our Neuropathology Core. This implementation will allow for rapid transmission of pathological data for consultation and collaborations, distribution of materials for educational purposes, tissue specimen archiving, and image analysis. In addition, by having a digital pathology with immunofluorescent capabilities will allow for viewing of the distribution (including overlap) of multiple proteins at one time within a tissue specimen. This can enhance biological studies by providing spatial relationships of proteins resulting in a deeper phenotype of disease. This supplement application is designed to support equipment and leverage and enhance infrastructure to allow the UCD ADC the ability to 1) purchase a whole slide image system to digitize existing and future histologically stained samples 2) leverage and enhance current servers and database systems to allow for storage and rapid retrieval of digital images and their data and 3) leverage and enhance hardware to develop and deploy pipelines for quantitative computational methodologies for pathologies found within a diverse ethnoracial cohort of Alzheimer’s disease brains. The UCD ADC continues to excel and expand in its research initiatives to collect and provide brain specimens and pathological data on a diverse population of individuals at various stages of cognitive ability and dementia risk. This supplement will further enable suitable infrastructure for enhancement of current collaborations and facilitate emerging collaborations by providing a means to share and analysis pathology on digitized whole slide images.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9838988,R44AG059458,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emergencies ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' fire ', ' Fires ', ' Fire -

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research.

"Socially-Assistive Robots for AlzheimerÃ¢ÂÂs (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks. Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) is a socially integrative and supportive robot to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD).

"Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions. Progression of AD is characterized by losses in memory, orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Gains in understanding AD pathogenesis have not yet translated into pharmacological therapies that effectively slow or halt disease progression. Evidence-based behavioral approaches are rapidly becoming recognized as methods to provide effective neurocognitive and therapeutic support for AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers1.  Behavioral approaches such as lifestyle changes and risk reduction are non-pharmacological therapies that are accessible, personalizable, have no side effects, and are low in cost. To that end, we are developing mobile device software that is patient and caregiver centered, and provides behavioral-based assistance through visual mapping. The MapHabitTM system (MHS) uses pictures and keywords to assist memory- impaired patients and caregivers in organizing and successfully accomplishing their activities of daily living. This approach is innovative through its unique recruitment of the brain’s habit learning system (neostriatum) rather than the hippocampal structures damaged in AD. Preliminary work revealed that commercially available visual mapping software is too complicated for memory-impaired and technology-naïve individuals to use effectively. Commercially available software is proprietary and cannot be modified to meet their needs.  In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we propose to further develop and enhance MHS by integrating three novel specific aims that involve (1) development of adaptive user interfaces which can be personalized and dynamically adjusted for cognitive status, allowing for a greater range of memory-impaired individuals to benefit from visual mapping; (2) linkage of personalized visual maps to smart devices, including wearables (e.g., Apple iWatch) and audio interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo); (3) establishment of a predictive analytics tool that will accurately track and predict changes in functional status.  We are advantaged in this SBIR Phase 1 application by having access to patients and caregivers, including underrepresented minority populations, who are currently involved in our preliminary studies assessing the impact of visual mapping on quality of life measures. All of these individuals are already well- characterized in terms of their cognitive and emotional behavior, both before and after the use of visual mapping (see letters of support from Dr. E. Vaughn, Atlanta VA Health Care System, Dr. M. Parker, Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and F. Boatman, RN, Speak Life Management). Those studies will contribute to the preliminary data section of our planned SBIR Phase 2 application that will: assess the effectiveness of MHS on a broad range of large clinical populations, improve the user-experience for memory-impaired individuals, and refine our methods of machine learning to predict healthcare outcomes. Impressive gains in our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not created therapies that are safe and effective. We are developing the MapHabitTM system, an application for mobile devices that is safe, non- invasive, and low in cost, which helps memory-impaired individuals and caregivers accomplish activities and improve independent function. This is done by using a technique called visual mapping to utilize areas of the brain that are not damaged by AD.",Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers,9848374,R43AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Geriatrics ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' assistive device ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Software ', ' Computer software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Neostriatum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Memory impairment ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Bypass ', ' Memory Loss ', ' memory decline ', ' Modeling ', ' software development ', ' developing computer software ', ' develop software ', ' Apple ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' cost ', ' habit learning ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' visual map ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' mobile device ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' recruit ', ' smart watch ', ' smartwatch ', ' wearable device ', ' wearable sensor ', ' body worn sensor ', ' body sensor ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' Nonpharmacologic Therapy ', ' Non-pharmacologic Therapy ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' Alzheimer related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' side effect ', ' ']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R43,2019,498609,GA-05,-0.03273580565407681
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims. PROJECT NARRATIVE Successful development of small vessel disease (SVD) biomarkers will advance public health by changing the landscape of research, diagnosis, and treatment in vascular and AD dementias, which commonly have mixed pathologies. SVD biomarkers will specifically refine participant selection in clinical trials, improve diagnosis of the most common types of dementia, and advance target selection in studies of the prevention and treatment of dementia in older persons.",Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia.,9768245,UH3NS100599,"['Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Alzheimers Dementia ', "" Alzheimer's "", ' Alzheimer syndrome ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' infarct ', ' Infarction ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Memory ', ' Persons ', ' Pathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sclerosis ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Specificity ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Measures ', ' cerebrovascular amyloidosis ', ' Congophilic Angiopathy ', ' Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Microscopic ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Databases ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Collaborations ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Prevention ', ' neuropathology ', ' imaging method ', ' image-based method ', ' imaging modality ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Validation ', ' Pathologic ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Image ', ' imaging ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' White Matter Disease ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' treatment response ', ' therapeutic response ', ' response to treatment ', ' candidate marker ', ' candidate biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' data sharing ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' vascular risk factor ', ' in vivo imaging ', ' imaging in vivo ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Prevention trial ', ' cognitive ability ', ' magnetic resonance imaging biomarker ', ' MRI biomarker ', ' protective factors ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' in vivo testing ', ' pathology imaging ', ' ']",NINDS,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UH3,2019,1152217,IL-07,0.09703420774244197
"CATcare: Cognitive Assistive Technology for Dementia Homecare Project Summary/Abstract Family members with a relative with dementia often face complex, and stressful life situations that many other caregivers do not. Multiple factors make the adjustment to the caregiving role particularly hard, as the caregiver balances this role with other demands, including child rearing, careers, and relationships. For people with dementia, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and previously acquired knowledge are generally limited, making it difficult to distinguish relevant information from irrelevant information. Tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently and an inability to remember events that occurred only a few days, hours, or even minutes previously makes day-to-day decision-making and navigating built environments difficult. The recall of routes and tasks may be unpredictable, therefore caregivers are often left with the constant and repetitive responsibility of prompting and cueing the care recipient, leading to additional stress in their caregiving role. This project aims to develop a low-cost wearable device to improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, and potentially create a new paradigm to provide assistance and care to individuals with dementia in a home environment. This innovative cognitive assistive technology, called CATcare, will be specifically designed to provide two-way assistance to the dementia caregiver and care recipient dyad living at home, enabling the individual with dementia more independence and situational awareness in the home setting, as well as improving his or her quality of life with less reliance on the caregiver. Caregivers, on the other hand, will be able to fully program, adjust, and customize the system for a given living environment according to the care recipient’s current habits, needs and conditions. This device can potentially prolong the period that the dementia patients stay at home and age in place, reducing the financial burden to both government and individuals as well as emotional and physical stress to caregivers. The proposed CATcare prototype not only encapsulates the newest hardware innovations (including smartglass and smartphone) but also advanced software solutions (including state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, computer vision techniques). In conclusion, this project will lead to the integration and development of an affordable, portable and versatile wearable intervention to address the long-standing and fast-growing challenges facing current and future dementia homecare. For individuals with dementia living at home, perceptible capabilities, fundamental information-processing capabilities and tasks such as making breakfast or teeth brushing may become too difficult to complete independently, leading to the responsibility of repetitive prompting and cueing by the caregiver. To improve the quality and sustainability of dementia homecare that is beneficial to both care recipients and caregivers, we propose to create an innovative wearable technology called CATcare which will be designed to provide navigational and cueing assistance to care recipients in the home environment.

"Network Modelling of Multimodal Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by misfolded proteins that march through brain circuits trans-neuronally, causing stereotyped patterns of damage to the brain over decades of progression, and increasing clinical and cognitive impairments. Using new imaging techniques, spatiotemporal mapping of the biomarkers of AD, including of atrophy, metabolism, and pathology deposition, are becoming possible. However, the precise relationship of these biomarkers to each other is not known. These factors, coupled with insidious onset, clinical heterogeneity, overlap with other dementias and variability in progression, make a rigorous characterization and prognosis difficult. Although the “trans-neuronal” mechanism of pathology naturally suggests that pathology spread must follow the brain's fiber connectivity, existing methods of predicting progression and cognitive decline do not currently exploit the network information, relying instead on phenomenological or statistical approaches unanchored in the biophysics of networked spread. These gaps hinder understanding of the biophysical mechanism underlying dementias, and preclude accurate quantitative predictors of patients' future trajectory. The objective of this application is to learn, test and apply biophysical models of networked spread in AD. Our central hypothesis is that once a patient's baseline disease status is known, all subsequent disease-related processes are enacted on the brain's fiber connectivity network, i.e. the “connectome”, in a fully predictable manner. Influence of genetic and environmental actors is already factored in the baseline data. This project will build on and extend our recent novel graph theoretic Network Diffusion model, which mathematically captures the process of trans-neuronal network spread, and is ideally suited for investigating these issues. With this network model as a foundation, we will bring together all key elements of the causal AD progression chain. Then, using human imaging data (atrophy from MRI, Aβ from AV45-PET, tau from T807-PET and metabolism from FDG-PET) from the public ADNI study, we will mathematically characterize 1) network-based spread of tau and amyloid-beta, 2) the relationship between tau deposition and regional atrophy, and amyloid deposition and regional metabolism. Next, these validated models will be entered in a state-space generative mode of progression that will predict future spatial patterns of the biomarkers. An alternative deep learning approach will also be developed as a comparison with the proposed biophysical modeling approach. Success of this proposal could have wide implications in treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations. Our long-term goal is to develop a common connectome-based biophysics model underlying all dementias, forming the core of novel computational diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. NARRATIVE Alzheimer's Disease is the most widespread and debilitating age-related degenerative disorder, with more than 40 million elderly subjects affected worldwide and $600 billion in care-related expenses. This project will investigate the network spread of the pathogens involved in the disease, and from that information, build a tracking and predictive software. If successful, this will give a computational diagnostic and prognostic tool with wide implications in the treatment, care, planning and monitoring of dementia in susceptible populations.",Network

"Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science The central goal of this proposed Roybal Center is to develop, test, and implement novel interventions that bridge the dramatic gap between the supply of and need for palliative care services among persons with dementia (PWD) living in long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, as well as their family caregivers. Several innovative aspects of this proposed Center position us to succeed in this challenging but increasingly important space. First, we have assembled a team comprising more 50 investigators and staff from 5 schools within the University of Pennsylvania, and the most accomplished investigators of palliative approaches to care for PWD from 11 peer institutions. These investigators possess content knowledge and tremendous expertise in leading all Stages of behavioral intervention development as defined by the NIH Stage Model. Second, we will support these behavioral scientists by linking them with Center faculty with expertise in several key methodologic areas including behavioral economics, data science, statistics, qualitative methods, health policy and economics, and implementation science. Our focus on translating behavioral economic insights to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers involved in the care of PWD builds on our recent success using similar approaches to improve palliative care delivery in outpatient and hospital settings. Our focus on using machine learning, natural language processing, and network methods will enable us to (a) identify mechanisms of clinician behavior that account for aggressive care for PWD, (b) identify PWD with the greatest unmet palliative care needs so as to sustainably target intervention delivery, and (c) more efficiently measure person-centered outcomes in the context of large, pragmatic trials of the most promising interventions. Third, this Center is being launched in partnership with Genesis HealthCare, the nation's largest owner of LTSS facilities, with 401 nursing homes and assisted living facilities across the U.S. These facilities provide ideal settings within which to develop and test interventions that will be effective and sustainable in the real world. Further, by developing and testing the interventions in these settings, while continually increasing our collaborations with other owners of LTSS facilities, we will be ideally positioned to implement effective interventions in the places in which the majority of Americans with dementia are cared for near the end of life. This Center will be directed by a Steering Committee, and will include a Management and Administrative Core housed within Penn's existing Palliative and Advanced Illness Research (PAIR) Center. A Pilot Core will select, guide, and monitor pilot projects chosen for funding each year. We propose two pilots for funding in the first year: a Stage I study that seeks to adapt a web-based advance care planning platform for use among PWD and their caregivers in LTSS settings, and a Stage 0 study that will use data science methods to identify clinician behaviors associated with hospitalization risk among PWD, yielding targets for future interventions. NARRATIVE Although most persons with dementia (PWD) die in nursing homes and other long-term services and support (LTSS) facilities, few interventions have improved the processes or outcomes of care for such patients. This Roybal Center will unite junior and senior physician, nurse, and social scientists with expertise in Stages 0-V behavioral intervention studies, behavioral economics, and data science with a shared goal to develop, test, and implement interventions to change the behaviors of clinicians and caregivers for PWD in LTSS facilities. We will achieve this goal by partnering with the nation's leading researchers in palliative care for PWD and the largest owner of nursing homes, using its facilities as sites for the pilot studies we will support.",Transforming residential palliative care for persons with dementia through behavioral economics and data science,9810433,P30AG064105,"['Arts ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' nursing home ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Societies ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Businesses ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Mechanical ventilation ', ' mechanical respiratory assist ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Fostering ', ' Logistics ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' Family Nursing ', ' Family-Centered Nursing ', ' success ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' advanced disease ', ' advanced illness ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Assisted Living Facilities ', ' assistive living facilities ', ' assistive living ', ' assisted living ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Institution ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' symptom management ', ' manage symptom ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' Behavioral ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health economics ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' person centered ', ' implementation science ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' effective intervention ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' behavioral economics ', ' Data Science ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' Pragmatic clinical trial ', ' dementia care ', ' efficacy study ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2019,768436,PA-03,0.10174296788802763
"A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment Project Summary The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is expected to triple by 2050, contributing to decreased quality of life, increased medical care utilization, and additional burden on an already stressed primary care system. Many clinicians lack confidence to assess, diagnose and manage cognitive impairment (CI), and more than 50% of patients with CI are undiagnosed. Unfortunately, studies show that even in settings with high rates of standardized CI screening, very few patients who screen positive have documentation of any clinician follow-up action. To address these important problems, in phase 1 (R61) of this project, we will develop and validate a machine learning model (called MC-PLUS) using results from brief Mini- Cog (MC) screens completed routinely at Annual Medicare Wellness exams and electronic health record (EHR) data to identify patients at elevated risk of a future dementia diagnosis (AD/ADRD). We will also develop and validate a web-based and EHR-integrated CI clinical decision support (CI-CDS) system to engage patients and clinicians in conversation about elevated dementia risk, and to give clinicians the confidence and tools they need to diagnose and manage CI. Both MC-PLUS and the CI-CDS system will be added into an existing web-based CDS platform that has high use rates and primary care clinician satisfaction, and is already seamlessly integrated within the EHR. This CDS platform improves outcomes for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and high cardiovascular risk as shown in published studies. We will systematically validate the CI-CDS system with expert champions prior to conducting a pilot test at one primary care clinic. After milestones for success are demonstrated, we will begin phase 2 (R33), a large pragmatic trial with 30 primary care clinics randomized to receive CI-CDS or usual care (UC). We will evaluate change in clinician confidence in CI detection and care management in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. If successful, the CI-CDS system will improve rates of new CI diagnosis and narrow existing sociodemographic disparities in adults with elevated dementia risk identified by MC-PLUS at index visit in CI-CDS compared to UC clinics. We will evaluate the impact of the intervention on care management and care plans using EHR data and chart audits. We will assess determinants of clinician actions in response to the CDS system using behavior change theory and technology acceptance constructs, and conduct phone surveys of patient and caregiver dyads to evaluate intervention effects on feelings of preparedness for decision making and distress. The CI-CDS system is immediately scalable to large numbers of patients through the existing non-commercialized CDS platform already in use for millions of patients in care systems spanning 14 states. The CDS system implemented as described could maximize return on massive investments that have been made in EHR systems, and provide a prototype to rapidly and consistently translate evolving evidence-based CI guidelines into personalized CI care and guidance within primary care. Project Narrative Most experts advocate for early detection of cognitive impairment (CI) so that patients and caregivers can be prepared for making difficult decisions and to improve quality of life, but studies show that screening alone isn’t sufficient to change clinician actions related to early detection. Using predictive modelling developed with machine learning methods and sophisticated clinical decision support (CDS) tools, it is possible to identify patients at elevated risk for CI and make it much easier for primary care to engage and support patients and caregivers in meaningful care planning. In this project, we implement and evaluate a low-cost, highly scalable CI-CDS system integrated within the electronic health record that has high potential to improve early CI detection and care and translate massive public and private sector investments in health informatics into tangible health benefits for large numbers of people.",A Technology-Driven Intervention to Improve Early Detection and Management of Cognitive Impairment,10092423,R61AG069770,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Office Visits ', ' physician office visit ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patient Care Planning ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Printing ', ' Private Sector ', ' Public Sector ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Risk ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Predictive Value ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Newly Diagnosed ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Prevalence ', ' prototype ', ' evidence base ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' intervention effect ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' screening ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' support tools ', ' Theory of Change ', ' improved outcome ', ' clinical decision support ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R61,2020,592048,MN-03,0.05859152518182167
"Development of a Caregiver Application and AI-Enabled Intelligent Assistant to Support Families and Formal Care Providers in Caring for Persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias PROJECT ABSTRACT Family caregivers face daunting challenges in caring for persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, there is no widely available mechanism to provide real-time, context sensitive support to informal AD caregivers that can address the specific care needs of each AD patient. To address this critical gap, we developed CareVirtue, an innovative web/mobile application for family caregivers that also assists formal care providers helping these families. During this Phase I project we will validate the CareVirtue web/mobile application as a method for caregivers to document daily care interactions with AD patients, and establish the utility of the generated data to develop predictive models for an intelligent caregiver assistant application. Looking ahead, our long term goal is to commercialize an AI-enabled intelligent caregiver assistant application that provides on demand, highly-relevant information about AD patients to care teams, which will ameliorate caregiver stress & burden, reduce health care expenditures, and improve quality of care for both AD patients and their caregivers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Family caregivers face daunting challenges in caring for persons with Alzheimer’s disease. Currently, there is no widely available mechanism to provide real-time, context sensitive support to informal AD caregivers that can address the specific care needs of each AD patient.

"Exploring the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline in patients with knee osteoarthritis Abstract Both aging and chronic pain have a pronounced impact on the brain. Thus, the interplay of chronic pain, aging, and the brain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder among the elderly population. Two recent studies with large sample sizes found that that knee OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia. Nevertheless, why knee OA is associated with high dementia risk remains unknown. Taking advantage of the NCCIH / NIH funded project (R33 AT009310) on brain mechanisms of acupuncture and imagined acupuncture treatment of knee OA, this ancillary application will allow us to expand our research on cognitive decline in patients with knee OA. Specifically, with the support of new funding, we will 1) add a cohort of heathy controls (50 age- and gender-matched controls without knee OA), 2) collect blood samples to assess inflammation markers, and 3) add cognitive measurements, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), to assess the cognitive function of both knee OA patients and controls. With newly collected data, we will combine machine learning methods and multimodality neuroimaging techniques to 1) calculate neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ and compare the predicted age difference (PAD, difference between brain age and chronological age) between the knee OA patients and matched controls; 2) investigate the inflammation markers and brain structure and function (on cognition-related brain areas/networks) differences between the knee OA patients and controls; and 3) explore the association between inflammation markers, PAD, brain function and structure, and cognitive function as determined by MoCA score, as well as the modulation effect of alternative treatments on the above measurements.

"Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers Abstract  Caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, or another neurodegenerative disease is a highly meaningful part of family life. However, the associated burden and strain can have adverse effects on caregivers including mental and physical health problems, reduced well-being, and increased mortality. These effects, in turn, can compromise care quality and shorten survival times for people with dementia (PWD). Research has consistently found that behavioral symptoms in PWD are most strongly associated with adverse caregiver effects, even more so than cognitive and functional symptoms. Empirically- supported interventions are needed that: (a) target mechanisms/pathways shown to connect behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse effects in caregivers, and (b) can be disseminated successfully into larger community settings. In this SBIR Fast Track application, we will develop, refine, and evaluate People Power Caregiver (PPCg), a flexible and expandable hardware/software system designed to integrate in-home sensors and devices, emergency responding, social networking, and Internet-of-Things (i.e., devices that can be controlled and communicated with via the internet) technologies to create a more supportive and safe home environment for caregivers and PWD. PPCg monitors troublesome behaviors in PWD (e.g., wandering), and targets mechanisms (e.g., worry, social isolation) thought to link behavioral symptoms in PWD with adverse caregiver outcomes. PPCg is also designed to minimize demands on caregivers’ limited time and energy and to provide a platform for data collection that can be used by researchers and care professionals.  This application is an innovative partnership between People Power (CEO: Gene Wang, www.peoplepowerco.com) in Redwood City, California and the Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory (Director: Robert W. Levenson) at the University of California, Berkeley. People Power is an award-winning, established leader in home monitoring and Internet-of-Things technology and has recently started developing assistive technologies for the elderly. The Berkeley Psychophysiology Laboratory has been engaged in basic and applied research with PWD and other neurodegenerative diseases and their caregivers for the past 15 years. The proposal addresses three specific aims: Aim 1: Focus groups. In Phase I of the project, a preliminary version of PPCg will be developed and refined with input from focus groups of caregivers and in- home testing (Study 1). Aim 2: Efficacy. In the first year of Phase II of the project, the first production version of PPCg will be installed by the research team in 80 homes and evaluated in a randomized controlled efficacy trial that includes careful diagnosis and assessment of emotional functioning in PWD and caregivers (Study 2). Aim 3: Effectiveness. In the second year of Phase II of the project, working with energy industry partners, a refined and expanded second production version of PPCg will be provided to 400 homes with familial caregivers for self-installation and evaluation in a community-based effectiveness trial (Study 3). Relevance  Dementias cause profound cognitive, emotional, and functional deficits. As the disease progresses, people with dementia become increasingly dependent on caregivers, who are at heightened risk for mental and physical health problems. Applying assistive technology to monitor worrisome behaviors, improve safety, and reduce social isolation in the home environment can reduce caregiver burden and improve care in ways that have major public health benefits.",Developing and Evaluating In-Home Supportive Technology for Dementia Caregivers,9858205,R44AG059458,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Symptoms ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fire -

"Dementia Risk Prediction Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem which is increasing worldwide. Currently, over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other dementias and as our population continues to age this number will increase to over 13.8 million by 2050. Great strides are being made in targeted therapies which may be able to reduce the risk for dementia. However, identifying which patients should receive these prevention interventions is currently unknown and has been identified by NINDS and experts in the field as a critical area of research. Research done by our group and others has demonstrated that risk factor levels as early in life as the 20's influence an individual's future risk for dementia. Early intervention to prevent the accumulation of risk and targeted interventions for those at high risk could help to reduce dementia risk. Risk prediction methods can be used to accurately predict who is at high risk for developing dementia and target interventions; however, current risk prediction models for dementia have several critical limitations and none have taken into account longitudinal risk factor trajectories, a critical step to implementing precision prevention approaches to identify individuals at high risk for dementia.  In this study we propose to develop the Dementia Risk Pooling Project (DRPP) by pooling and rigorously harmonizing 12 prospective observational cohorts of middle and older age adults, multiple in-person assessments of clinical, genetic and behavioral risk factors, follow-up of greater than 10 years and adjudicated dementia ascertainment. The DRPP will be completed and made available to researchers via a cloud-based computing platform as part of the R61 phase of this proposal meeting specific Go/No-Go Criteria outlined in the grant. Then, within the R33 phase of this project we will use the DRPP to develop and validate an accurate and personalized, dynamic dementia risk prediction model which incorporates longitudinal risk factor measurements and easily updates as new measurements are accrued. This tool can be used clinically to guide treatment decisions and will be made available to clinicians. The aims of this project are important and timely, they will provide a risk stratification tool for targeted intervention/prevention for high risk individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major public health problem.

"Towards Generating a Multimodal and Multivariate Classification Model from Imaging and Non-Imaging Measures for Accurate Diagnosis and Monitoring of Dementia in Parkinsons disease. PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research is to identify the best predictive biomarkers of dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) through a multimodal and multivariate statistical model utilizing both neuroimaging derived measures (diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and T1-weighted MRI measures) and non- imaging measures such as demographics (age, sex, years of education), clinical (disease duration and severity), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF-measures (Total Tau, β-Amyloid, α-synuclein). It is critical to identify biomarkers that can predict dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) as approximately 50-80% of PD patients develop PDD within twelve years of diagnosis. Identifying pathophysiology-based biomarkers that could identify PD patients at high risk for PDD reliably is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and better understanding the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project has two important components. The first component of the project is to understand the pathophysiological mechanism underlying PDD through sophisticated voxelwise dMRI-derived measures estimated using a multi-shell high angular and spatial resolution dMRI data acquisition, and understanding network-level white matter (WM)-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity in PDD. The second component of the project is to identify the biomarkers that predict PDD through multivariate statistical modelling by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures (such as clinical, demographics, genetics, and CSF-measures). We will recruit demographically matched healthy controls (HC) along with demographically, disease duration, and disease severity matched PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD-non-MCI (PD-nMCI), and PDD for this project. We will acquire multi-shell dMRI data at three b-values, namely 500s/mm2, 1000s/mm2, and 2500s/mm2 with a high angular and spatial resolution and estimate various unbiased free-water (fiso) corrected Gaussian dMRI-derived measures along with non-Gaussian dMRI-derived measures such as diffusion kurtosis measures, and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging measures. We will further compare these measures between the groups to identify significant dMRI-derived measures separating the groups, and understanding the neuroanatomical correlates of these measures with various neuropsychological scores. Furthermore, we will estimate dMRI-derived structural connectivity and rsfMRI-derived functional connectivity to understand network-level discrepancies predicting PDD. These pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures will be further combined with various non-imaging measures through a novel machine learning algorithm to identify the comprehensive and best predictors of PDD. The tools developed in our proposal also has great potential for significantly advancing the understanding of other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) thereby helping to understand AD- and PD-specific neuroanatomical changes predicting dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is highly relevant to public health because identification of the Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients at a high-risk for developing dementia (PDD) is critical for better prognostication, correct identification of PDD in its prodromal stage to recruit in new disease-modifying clinical trials, and to better understand the pathophysiological processes underlining PDD. The proposed project identifies the best predictive biomarkers for PDD through examining the comprehensive Gaussian and non-Gaussian diffusion-MRI (dMRI)-derived white matter (WM) changes predicting PDD, examining the network-level discrepancies predicting PDD derived from dMRI-derived whole-brain structural connectivity and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI)-derived whole-brain functional connectivity, and developing a multivariate and multimodal statistical model by combining these sophisticated pathologically relevant neuroimaging measures with non-imaging measures such as clinical (disease duration and severity), demographics (age, sex, years of education), genetics (LRRK2), and CSF- measures (β-Amyloid, α-Synuclein, tau) to identify the best predictive biomarkers of PDD through machine learning approach.

"US-South American Initiative for Genetic-Neural-Behavioral Interactions in Human Neurodegenerative Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Although dementia has a global impact, efforts to address ensuing challenges have come mostly from high- income countries (HICs). Whereas the prevalence and incidence of dementia appear to be stable or declining in such countries, an alarmingly opposite tendency typifies South American countries (SAC). This scenario proves even more challenging due to region-specific traits. First, the particular genetic and environmental backgrounds of SAC limit the generalizability of key findings from HICs. Moreover, the greater genetic diversity and impact of socioeconomic status (SES) of SAC remain markedly understudied. Of note, this is true of the four largest SAC (Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Peru), representing over 75% of the region’s population. In addition, SAC face a dearth of innovative, harmonized, and cross-regional studies on two of their most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is thus critical for SAC to join ongoing international efforts and develop a gold-standard approach for detecting disease-specific alterations in a context of methodological, genetic, and socioeconomic heterogeneity. Against this background, our long-term goal is to identify the unique genetic and SES factors that drive AD and FTD presentation in SAC relative to the US. To this end, we will establish a cohort to test large samples from the four abovementioned SAC, as well as the US (totaling > 3000 participants, including 1500 controls, 750 AD patients, and 750 FTD patients). We will combine standardized clinical assessments with innovative analytical techniques including multimodal machine learning to account for heterogeneity in these diverse populations. By combining standardized genetic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (SES-cognitive) measures, we will test the underlying hypothesis that there are unique risk factors for AD and FTD in SAC which do not prove significant in US populations. More particularly, we will aim to (a) establish genetic risk to AD and FTD in diverse SAC cohorts; (b) test whether patients from SAC and the US can be discriminated after accounting for how SES affects cognitive and brain imaging signatures; and (c) determine genetic, cognitive, cerebral, and socioeconomic factors that discriminate among SAC vs. US patients. Positive impacts of this work include a better understanding of the genetic and socioeconomic factors driving neurocognitive manifestations of dementia, and the identification of novel genetic targets for risk reduction and disease prevention in SAC. Our large multimodal, cross-sectional study will enable clinical assessment of understudied patient groups, extend and harmonize existing data sets, and prompt the development of novel measures and multimodal machine learning protocols. More generally, by establishing a collaborative framework which capitalizes on unique regional populations, our proposal can consolidate a SAC-based platform for future translational research and assessment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although the prevalence and incidence of dementia appears to be stable or declining in high-income countries, South American countries (SAC) face the opposite scenario, with increased dementia prevalence, probably triggered by a combination of genetic and socioeconomic status (SES) factors. This proposal aims to create the first SAC-based multicenter initiative to study dementia, by combining genomic, neuroimaging, and behavioral (cognitive, clinical, socioeconomic) data. This project constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to foster regional synergy and multilevel research towards the harmonization of global strategies to fight dementia in SAC.",US-South American

"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk

"Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial. Nearly half of people currently living with dementia have not received a diagnosis, delaying access to treatment as well as education and support for the patient and family. Thus, NIA has requested applications to support pragmatic clinical trials of low-cost tools to improve detection of cognitive decline in clinical settings (RFA-AG- 20-051). With pilot funding from NIA, we used machine learning to develop a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule), which uses easily accessible information in the electronic health record (EHR) to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. In addition, we interviewed patients, caregivers, clinicians, and healthcare system leaders to inform pragmatic implementation of eRADAR in clinical settings. Stakeholders felt strongly that such a tool should be implemented through primary care, in the context of existing clinical relationships, and would need to be accompanied by additional support for patients and clinicians. Our current proposal is heavily informed by this development work. In Aim 1, we will use EHR data to evaluate eRADAR's performance in different patient subgroups, including by race/ethnicity, in two healthcare systems to inform selection of cut- points for use in clinical settings. We will select an optimal cut-point to use for targeted dementia assessment with stakeholder input, balancing sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value. In Aim 2, we will perform a pragmatic clinical trial to determine whether implementing eRADAR as part of a supported outreach process to high-risk patients improves dementia detection. The setting will be primary care clinics within Kaiser Permanente Washington (KPWA), an integrated healthcare delivery system in Washington State, and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), an urban, academic healthcare system with a diverse patient population. The study includes 6 clinics with ~24,000 patients age ≥65. Within each clinic, primary care providers (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to have their patients with high eRADAR scores targeted for outreach (intervention) or to usual care (control). Our clinical research staff—whose roles were designed to reflect existing roles within these healthcare systems to maximize pragmatism—will reach out to patients with high eRADAR scores, conduct an assessment for cognitive impairment, make follow-up recommendations to PCPs, and support patients after diagnosis. Patients with high eRADAR scores in both treatment arms will be followed to determine the impact of eRADAR on new diagnoses of dementia (primary outcome) as assessed from the EHR (again, to maximize pragmatism). In Aim 3, we will explore the impact of eRADAR implementation on secondary outcomes including healthcare utilization and experience of patients and family members. If this pragmatic trial is successful, the eRADAR tool and process could be spread to other healthcare systems, potentially improving detection of cognitive decline, patient care, and quality of life. Most patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed relatively late in the disease process, and about half of people living with dementia are undiagnosed. We have developed a low-cost tool called eRADAR (electronic health record Risk of Alzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule) that uses information in electronic health records to help identify patients with undiagnosed dementia. This study will determine whether a supported process of reaching out to patients with high eRADAR scores as part of primary care leads to earlier detection of dementia and improves patient care.","Low-cost detection of dementia using electronic health records data: validation and testing of the eRADAR algorithm in a pragmatic, patient-centered trial.",10091300,R01AG069734,"['Academic

"The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline Many older adults experience declines in cognitive ability that can be substantial, including mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Population aging, coupled with age-related cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, represents an unprecedented challenge. Early detection of cognitive impairment is a crucial goal. This would allow individuals at risk for mild cognitive impairment and/or AD/ADRD to adopt lifestyle changes to minimize decrements and the risk for acquired cognitive impairment. However, the massive potential of cognitive training and longitudinal assessment to detect and prevent age-related cognitive impairment and dementia are unlikely to be realized unless individuals are willing and able to engage with these protocols for an extended period of time. Adherence to cognitive assessment and training is often poor. Addressing the gap between potential and realized benefits of early detection and prevention of cognitive impairment is an urgent goal as the population ages. The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia by 1) enhancing adherence to cognitive intervention and assessment protocols, 2) improving understanding of barriers to long-term adherence, and 3) assisting in the development of algorithms for predicting and preventing adherence failures. Projects aim to investigate these issues within samples of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. Two randomized controlled trials will test an adaptive, tailored, and integrated technology support system predicted to boost adherence to cognitive protocols, over and above a simpler scheduling and reminder system over 6 months. Studies will provide valuable and generalizable insight into not only the benefits of adherence support, but also the individual difference factors that shape protocol adherence (e.g., attitudes, cognitive ability, dementia status, health status, personality, technology proficiency). Data will inform the process of identifying individuals who would benefit from additional support, and predicting and preventing extended adherence failures before they happen. By increasing adherence, these studies will help improve early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, which will ultimately extend older adults' functional independence, improving their lives and the lives of their families, and reducing care and support resources needed to address lost independence like that associated with Alzheimer’s disease and AD-related dementia. Further, intervention studies for dementia and Alzheimer’s disease can be made more efficient through tools for identifying individuals likely to experience decline before substantial cognitive impairment has occurred. Results have implications that extend far beyond cognitive impairment; the methods and mechanisms uncovered have broad implications for technology-mediated assessment and protocols to enhance health and well-being in general. The project consists of two large randomized controlled trials and smaller needs assessment and usability studies that will guide their development and deployment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) project are to promote early detection and treatment of age-related cognitive impairment and dementia. This project will develop Artificial Intelligence-based reminder systems to help ensure long-term engagement to home-based cognitive assessment and cognitive training protocols to be able to detect and treat cognitive impairment as soon as possible.",The Adherence Promotion with Person-centered Technology (APPT) Project: Promoting Adherence to Enhance the Early Detection and Treatment of Cognitive Decline,9986599,R01AG064529,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Artificial Intelligence ', ' AI system ', ' Computer Reasoning ', ' Machine Intelligence ', ' Attitude ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cognition ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Personality ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight ', ' Measures ', ' Reminder Systems ', ' Mediating ', ' Schedule ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Age-associated cognitive decline ', ' Age-related cognitive decline ', ' Benign senescent forgetfulness ', ' age associated memory decline ', ' age related cognitive deficit ', ' age related cognitive impairment ', ' age related memory dysfunction ', ' Age-associated memory impairment ', ' Adopted ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cognitive training ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Coupled ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' person centered ', ' usability ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' public health relevance ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive performance ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive ability ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' functional independence ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' behavior adherence ', ' behavioral adherence ', ' algorithm development ', ' smart algorithm ', ' intelligent algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,692873,FL-05,0.06090471565611883
"A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life ABSTRACT  Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a group of progressive, terminal illnesses that will affect an estimated 14-million people in the United States by the year 2050. Caregivers experience chronic stress and they report feeling burdened and unprepared for making difficult end-of-life (EOL) care decisions, which may lead to unnecessary hospitalizations or avoidable transitions in care that affect end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL). Advance care planning (ACP), which improves EOL-QOL, is the gold-standard approach for improving concordance between preferences and actual care received at EOL. However, despite decades of research aimed at raising their rates, only 50% of those with AD/ADRD have a written ACP. Furthermore, there is a lack of current research evidence investigating the factors associated with transitions in care and EOL-QOL for persons with AD/ADRD, which could help guide EOL decision-making. To date, the state of the science is primarily cross-sectional in nature, and does not account for the influence of trajectories of decline, the effect these changes have on caregivers, nor how longitudinal changes in caregiving ultimately affect EOL care outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need to discover new approaches for preparing persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making informed, in-the-moment decisions, to ensure high EOL-QOL care and to support appropriate transitions in care as circumstances change over time. Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) and National Study on Caregiving (NSOC), we plan to use a machine learning based framework to identify the key determinants for predicting the risk for EOL care transitions and the traits of EOL-QOL among older adults residing in the community. This study has two specific aims: 1) Develop predictive model of factors related to end-of-life care transitions (e.g. inpatient death versus hospice) in persons with AD/ADRD longitudinally; and 2) Develop a predictive model of factors related to end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) in persons with AD/ADRD. Discovering knowledge in a large population- level dataset is foundational for the future development of a generalizable/scalable model for guiding persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers as they navigate a fragmented healthcare system while making difficult decisions for their loved ones. Our approach fills a critical gap between the current approaches for improving EOL-QOL and EOL transitions in care that focus on ACP as a singular outcome, by addressing the comprehensive needs of individuals with AD/ADRD and their caregivers that change over time. Our study will provide a predictive model for EOL-QOL and EOL care transitions. This is a critical first step for the future development of an approach for personalizing care to guide persons with AD/ADRD and their caregivers in making EOL care decisions. These results will have an important positive impact on EOL care, which aligns with the strategic goals of the National Institutes of Aging (NIA) and Nursing Research (NINR) to address clinical and translational gaps in the study of EOL care needs of people with AD/ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) are at high risk for experiencing burdensome care transitions, avoidable hospitalizations, and poor end-of-life quality-of-life (EOL-QOL) due to the increasing prevalence of multiple chronic illness and escalating demands placed on caregivers, resulting in significant personal and public socioeconomic burdens. Decades of research has focused on improving the rates of advance care plans above 50% among persons with AD/ADRD, however, others may benefit more from personalized guidance to help navigate the trajectory of decline that supports timely, “in the moment” medical decision making. This study addresses Goals 2 and 3 of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's disease to enhance care quality and efficiency and expand support for persons with AD/ADRD by identifying factors related to poor EOL-QOL and care transitions in the context of caregiving for the future development of a personalized approach to support in the moment healthcare decision-making.",A Longitudinal Examination to Predict Quality of Life and Care Transitions for Persons with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias at End-of-Life,9958923,R03AG067159,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Inpatients ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Persons ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patients ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Decision Support Model ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' phrases ', ' Terminal Illness ', ' terminal decline ', ' Terminal Disease ', ' Time Series Analysis ', ' Reporting ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Cognitive ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' inpatient care ', ' inpatient service ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' person centered ', ' high risk ', ' loved ones ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' care giver strain ', ' caregiver strain ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' secondary analysis ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' ']",NIA,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R03,2020,79750,NY-26,0.07004160621171411
"Multimodal MRI biomarkers of small vessel disease for older persons with and without dementia. ABSTRACT Small vessel disease (SVD) pathologies are very common in the brains of older persons and are related to decline in cognitive abilities, MCI, and dementia. SVD pathologies include three common vessel diseases and an array of related tissue injuries. SVD pathologies may cause dementia on their own but more commonly coexist with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related pathologies where they lower the threshold for dementia. Effective participant selection into trials, and prevention and treatment would greatly benefit from having in-vivo biomarkers of this pathology. Current biomarkers are limited by lack of specificity for SVD (vs. AD) pathology and lack of pathologic validation. We propose to overcome these obstacles by (1) further developing specific ex-vivo MR imaging features of SVD pathologies after controlling for AD and other pathologies, in the brains of persons with and without dementia; (2) training a classifier using machine learning and multimodal MRI, and testing the classifier in persons without dementia, and whether it is related to cognitive status proximate to death; (3) translating the classifier into an in-vivo biomarker which can be investigated in relation to vascular risk factors and cognition, MCI, and dementia; and (4) validating the biomarker in a separate cohort (ADNI) and by autopsy confirmation of SVD pathologies in a large group of older persons followed longitudinally with MRI who agree to autopsy at death. Finally we propose to (5) share data, expertise and biomarker strategies within the UH2/UH3 consortium and cross-validate selected biomarkers in older persons followed longitudinally with cognitive testing, blood draws and brain autopsy at the time of death. We propose to leverage the resources of two longitudinal clinical-imaging-pathology cohorts, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG017917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), to accomplish these aims.

"Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Extensive progress was made in the previous funding period of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We 1) elucidated the neuropathologic basis of cognitive decline due to Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD), 2) discovered genomic, experiential, psychological, and medical risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits including numerous risk factors for Alzheimer’s dementia with little to no relationship with ADRD brain pathologies, and 3) identified numerous potential novel therapeutic targets for cognitive decline, especially targets for cognitive decline not explained by common brain pathologies i.e., resilience. Here, the average person has average resilience and individuals can be more or less resilient. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target because if druggable it would offset the effects of any combination of brain pathologies. In this funding cycle, we propose to continue to follow MAP participants and conduct autopsies, and in this cycle, to obtain skin biopsies at autopsy to support a powerful new drug discovery program that integrates existing brain omics data with a new human cellular model of disease, i.e., skin derived fibroblast cultures induced into neuronal lines from persons with more or less resilience. We propose to: 1) define a robust and specific molecular signature of resilience in the human brain; 2) identify gene targets of resilience and establish human low-resilience cell models derived from MAP participants of known resilience; and 3) conduct drug discovery screens in the low-resilience models to identify compounds that increase resilience. These aims are supported by compelling preliminary work. An Exploratory Aim will continue to identify risk factors for ADRD clinical and pathologic traits leveraging the rich resource generated from the exposure data, repeated measures, and neuropathologic traits . All aims will examine sex as a biologic variable. A Secondary Aim will continue to share the unique and valuable resources generated by MAP including the to-be-generated fibroblast cell lines with the scientific community. Harnessing mechanisms of resilience to ADRD can slow down or prevent cognitive decline regardless of the presence and complexity of common brain pathologies. Therefore, the genes and compounds identified from our study will provide new therapeutic remedies to boost brain reserve in combating ADRD-related dementia. We believe that the proposed continuation will have a high and sustained impact on the field of aging and dementia research. POJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The identification of novel therapeutics to prevent of cognitive decline, MCI and Alzheimer’s dementia is a major public health priority. Resilience is a high value therapeutic target with the potential to maintain cognition regardless of the type and number of brain pathologies. The proposed continuation of MAP will identify genes and compounds that affect a molecular signature of resilience in a novel human cell model of disease from autopsied MAP partic ipants .",Epidemiologic Study of Neural Reserve and Neurobiology of Aging,10018624,R01AG017917,"['Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Biopsy ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Diseases ', ' Brain Disorders ', ' Encephalon Diseases ', ' Intracranial CNS Disorders ', ' Intracranial Central Nervous System Disorders ', ' Brain Pathology ', ' Cell Line ', ' CellLine ', ' Strains Cell Lines ', ' cultured cell line ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Female ', ' Fibroblasts ', ' Genes ', ' Genetic Screening ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Libraries ', ' Memory ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Persons ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Work ', ' apolipoprotein E-3 ', ' apo E-3 ', ' apo E3 ', ' apoE-3 ', ' apoE3 ', ' apolipoprotein E3 ', ' Measures ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Individual ', ' Gene Targeting ', ' Funding ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder model ', ' Disease model ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Modeling ', ' neuropathology ', ' Genomics ', ' drug discovery ', ' Skin ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Molecular Fingerprinting ', ' molecular profile ', ' molecular signature ', ' Molecular Profiling ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pathologic ', ' Molecular ', ' sex ', ' GWA study ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association study ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association study ', ' genome wide association study ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' therapeutic target ', ' iPS ', ' iPSC ', ' iPSCs ', ' induced pluripotent stem cell ', ' combat ', ' new drug target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new therapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' public health relevance ', ' public health priorities ', ' CRISPR ', ' CRISPR/Cas system ', ' Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ', ' sharing hub ', ' data hub ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' Drug Screening ', ' model of human ', ' human model ', ' in silico ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,3035766,IL-07,0.06047229048655115
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ',

"Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of Elderly Individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia The objective of the proposed direct Phase-II SBIR project is to develop and study and the effectiveness of Serious Games and physical Activities played/performed by elderly people with Alzheimer’s disease and AD- related Dementias in interaction with Ryan, our successfully piloted Socially Assistive Robot (SAR). Ryan is an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with AD/ADRD. Ryan uses state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for automated facial expression recognition, natural language processing, and tracking of human body that are used in personalization and adaptation of the games and physical activities. According to the Alzheimer’s Association an estimated 5.7 million Americans have AD and is projected to rise to 13.8 million, as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technology such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. While SAR research prototypes exist that can interact with users playing physical cognitive games equipped with artificial intelligence technology and personalization, to our knowledge, no such cooperative SAR (prototype or commercial) for electronic gameplay with individuals suffering from dementia exists today. Our game designs will target “Cognition”, “Memory”, “Spatial Relation”, “Social Relationship”, and “Motor Skills” abilities of players. We will conduct a pilot study to measure Ryan’s effectiveness in mental and socio- emotional stimulation of users with mild dementia. This innovative technology stands to produce significant financial savings and improve the quality of life of individuals living with AD/ADRD, their families, and caregivers. The goal of the project is to develop serious games and physical activities co-played by a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Serious Games and Physical Activities Instructed by a Social Robot for Improving the Well-being of

"Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot randomized, controlled trial with outcomes assessment using digital phenotyping Over 15 million Americans serve as family caregivers of relatives with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD- Related Dementias (ADRD), and this often subjects them to tremendous stress, resulting in poorer mental health and higher risk of physical illness. Due to emotional and physical exhaustion, lack of time, and immediate needs related to caring for their loved ones, caregivers often forego their own self-care. The National Institute on Aging Strategic Plan identifies the need to develop better interventions to improve the mental and physical health of caregivers as a crucial priority area. The purpose of this Paul B. Beeson K76 Emerging Leaders Career Development Award in Aging Research application is to support the research training of Dr. Felipe Jain, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Jain’s work aims to improve caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone with guided imagery and mindfulness therapies that reduce stress and help the caregiver improve mentalizing (understanding the links between mind and behavior) of themselves, their loved one suffering from dementia and others in their social milieu. Further, Dr. Jain hopes to develop the skills in machine learning and data science necessary to estimate early changes in caregiver symptoms remotely and passively, without any additional effort on the part of the caregiver who is often already overwhelmed, using smartphone sensors that capture information about caregiver behaviors.  In the conduct of this K76 award, Dr. Jain will lead a randomized, controlled trial for 120 AD/ADRD caregivers 60 years of age or older. Caregivers will be assigned to receive smartphone applications that either include a caregiver skills toolbox alone, or a caregiver skills toolbox combined with Mentalizing Imagery Therapy (MIT). MIT uses guided imagery and mindfulness to help caregivers improve stress, reduce negative mood and increase mentalizing. Theoretically, stress reduction resulting from MIT due both to mindfulness skills and better mentalizing of the care recipient and others should help caregivers better implement tools for caregiving within their unique social environment and accounting for the care recipient’s individual symptoms.  The first aim of the study is to determine the clinical effects of App-delivered caregiver skills with or without MIT on caregivers’ perceived stress, caregiver burden, mastery, depression and insomnia. The second aim is to develop behavioral markers from smartphone sensors that are associated with outcomes. We will (1) test the hypothesis that smartphone estimated sleep is longitudinally associated with caregivers’ self-reported insomnia, stress and burden and (2) determine the feasibility of identifying behavioral features with machine learning to predict day-to-day sleep and stress. If successful, this research will help open a new avenue of AD/ADRD caregiver research and treatment focused on improving mentalizing. It will also inform the field of aging research regarding the feasibility of using smartphone sensors to detect changes in early behavioral markers that may be used by clinicians to intervene for older adults at risk of poor outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research will promote the public health of more than 15 million Americans who serve as family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. It will assess whether stress reduction therapy incorporating guided imagery practices that promote perspective taking and empathy can improve the effects of family caregiver skills training delivered remotely by smartphone. It will also test the feasibility of using smartphone estimated markers to track caregiver insomnia and stress, which could eventually help reduce caregiver suffering and healthcare costs by identifying early warning signs of treatment failure and symptomatic worsening.","Mobile app delivered Mentalizing Imagery Therapy to augment remote family dementia caregiver skills training: a pilot

"Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision Abstract The outbreak of SARS-Cov-2 virus has exasperated the vulnerability of dementia spousal caregivers, as well as those with Alzheimer’s disease or related dementias. SARS-Cov-2 is a highly contagious virus that can cause severe respiratory problems and even death. Older adults and people of all ages with underlying comorbidities are considered to be at “high-risk” for severe illness from COVID-19. During this pandemic, dementia spousal caregivers are tasked with the burden of keeping their spouse safe from getting sick and even dying from COVID- 19, while simultaneously performing their typical caregiving responsibilities. The vast majority of dementia spousal caregivers and their spouses with dementia are over sixty-five years of age, the age bracket that puts people at most risk for COVID-19 disease complications and mortality. Social distancing guidelines make up a large proportion of the current prevention recommendations; thus, loneliness and other negative emotions will likely be frequent and more intense than usual. The proposed competitive revision builds upon the primary aims of the parent grant (R01AG062690) by using attachment theory as an overarching theoretical framework to understand dementia spousal caregiver risk and resilience in light of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19 disease). The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PA-18-935, NOT-AG-20-022. Capitalizing on the dementia spousal caregivers who will take part in the parent study, we propose to collect additional data for one week each month for three months. We will collect this data using ecological momentary assessment methods, while passively assessing location, activity, autonomic activity, and sleep via smartphone and smartwatch technology. We aim to understand how emotions, assessed in real-time in the natural environment, affect the extent to which AD spousal caregivers adaptively navigate the challenges associated COVID-19. We will also aim to determine how relatively stable individual difference patterns that originate from people’s close relationship histories (i.e., attachment orientations) inform risk and resilience. As an exploratory high risk/high reward aim, we will evaluate if dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches can incorporate passively collected information (i.e., location, heart rate, heart rate variability, activity, sleep) with information that we learn from our primary aims, to yield a detailed and sophisticated understanding of real-world dynamics that predict three critical COVID-19 specific outcomes: social distancing adherence, social distancing self-efficacy, and caregiver self-efficacy. By understanding patterns of risk and resilience, intervention scientists will be better able to identify at-risk AD spousal caregivers. The proposed research would advance our understanding of how AD spousal caregivers can reduce illness exposure for themselves and those they care for in perhaps the most comprehensive, detailed, real-time, real-world investigation of social distancing in AD spousal caregivers to date. Narrative By identifying the factors that impede social distancing behaviors and impair a dementia spousal caregiver’s confidence to provide care, we will be able to design tailored and targeted interventions to reduce risk of COVID- 19 contagion, and improve quality of life for dementia spousal caregivers.",Individual differences in dementia spousal caregiver burden: A biobehavioral approach revision,10201213,R01AG062690,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Crowding ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease Outbreaks ', ' Outbreaks ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' foot ', ' Foundations ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Learning ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Virus ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' spousal care giver ', ' spousal caregiver ', ' spouse care giver ', ' Spouse Caregiver ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' respiratory ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' interest ', ' contagion ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Exclusion Criteria ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Individual Differences ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' Impairment ', ' Affective ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' parent grant ', ' high risk ', ' high reward ', ' heart rate variability ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' recruit ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk prediction model ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' ']",NIA,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,493162,TX-02,0.11812813563397448
"A Novel Mechanism for Helping Older Adults Discontinue Use of Sleeping Pills The use of hypnotics such as benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists (z-drugs), is associated with impaired cognition in older adults. Some studies suggest that benzodiazepine discontinuation is associated with improvement in cognitive domains such as memory, psychomotor speed, attention, and concentration and reduced risk of incident Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia. Sustained hypnotic discontinuation rates, however, are suboptimal, even when patients receive the gold standard treatment for insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI), combined with a supervised gradual tapering of the hypnotic. In our current “Sleep Without Insomnia or The use of Chronic Hypnotics (SWITCH)” trial (R01AG057929), we are testing the efficacy of a new program, Masked Taper plus cognitive behavioral therapy-augmented program (MTcap), for improving hypnotic discontinuation success rates. We are currently collecting cognitive outcomes using in-person, structured cognitive tests so that we can conduct pre-planned analyses that will examine the impact of MTcap on cognition. The long-term goal of the supplemental research is to understand the relationships between benzodiazepine/z-drug use, drug discontinuation, and insomnia and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia incidence. This supplement project’s objectives are to establish the feasibility of using patient-centric cognitive testing approaches that leverage the growing use of mobile technology among middle-aged and older adults and to explore novel measures of cognition collected through mobile technology (i.e., digital markers of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia). The central hypothesis is that benzodiazepines/z-drug use and insomnia impair cognition and that discontinuation of these hypnotics and treatment of insomnia may reduce Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia incidence. The central hypothesis will be tested in a future study, with preparatory work completed in the proposed supplemental project focusing on cognitive testing through mobile technology. This preliminary data, using an innovative approach, will improve our understanding of the relationships between hypnotic use, insomnia, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias and offer treatment options to reducing dementia incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it tests the feasibility of mobile cognitive testing in the context of chronic hypnotic use and chronic insomnia, which are both prevalent in adults, and provides preliminary data for future studies that will examine the relationships between hypnotic use, insomnia, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias.

"Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease The objective of the proposed Fast-Track SBIR effort is to develop and commercialize the Ryan CompanionBot (hereafter, Ryan), an intelligent conversational life-like social robot, designed to improve the well-being and quality of life of older adults with early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementia (ADRD). According to the NIA, research reports estimate that as many as 5.1 million Americans may have AD, and the number is expected to rise as the population ages. Common symptoms of AD/ADRD include cognitive decline, short-term memory loss, changes in mood, depression, communication difficulties, lost interest in hobbies or activities, and repetitive behavior. Americans suffering from AD/ADRD are believed to cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Traditional methods for disease management have shown limited success treating AD/ADRD or mitigating its symptoms. Health care personnel and caregivers who are physically and emotionally taxed are seeking new ways to provide care for elderly individuals and particularly those suffering from AD/ADRD. Innovative technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, have begun to alleviate the growing need for novel solutions to the healthcare. Among such technologies, socially assistive robots such as Ryan have received a great amount of attention in recent years. Ryan will be designed to promote social interaction and foster engagement and rapport, and improve mood and well-being of persons with early stage AD/ADRD. In the Phase I effort, we will develop facial emotion recognition technology and integrate it with Ryan and then conduct a pilot study to understand the feasiblity and effectiveness of Ryan in fostering empathy and rapport in interaction with persons with AD/ADRD. Once validated, we will work with domain experts to design and build aestehcically pleasing Ryan V2.0 and integrate the facial expression recognition technology with a spoken- dialog system, reminders, and other intelligent features into Ryan to address the needs of persons with early stage AD/ADRD and their caregivers. If successful, DreamFace will be positioned to bring to market an affordable and effective socially-assistive robot to improve the quality of life for persons with AD/ADRD. The goal of the project is to develop a socially assistive robot companionbot (Ryan) for improving the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Americans suffering from AD cost the nation $236 billion annually with projected annual costs of over $1 trillion by 2050. Successful development of Ryan will improve patient well-being, make caregivers more efficient and effective, and provide significant financial benefits to the healthcare industry, and assist families and caregivers who are looking for ways to better assist older adults with AD.",Development of Ryan Companion Robot for Assisting Elderly People with Alzheimer's Disease,9984218,R44AG059483,"['Age ',

"Exploration of MRI measures of neurodegeneration within individuals over short intervals PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY  Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia affect over five million Americans. Alzheimer's disease begins with changes in the brain more than a decade before the disease can be diagnosed from memory and cognitive impairment in a clinic. The goal of this work is to provide a way to measure early signs of neurodegeneration in individual people. The historical barrier to measure change in individuals is that each person's brain is different with change accumulating too slowly to be picked over short intervals. As a result, most research focuses on tracking averaged subject groups or tracking change over multiple years. The present work optimizes new brain imaging techniques using MRI to make extremely fast, highly precise repeated measurements of brain regions all within the same individual. The work then seeks to use the novel imaging approach to measure neurodegeneration in individuals with early stages of Alzheimer's disease in six months or less and also differentiate changes in people with Alzheimer's disease from less common forms of dementia that have distinct anatomical changes in the brain. If successful, the present work will provide a new means to track the early stages of neurodegeneration as would be used in clinical trials and translational medical research. NARRATIVE  The proposed research explores the possibility of precisely estimating change in specific brain structures in individuals at early stages of neurodegeneration. Anchoring from recent developments in fast brain scanning techniques, we use a novel methodological approach that permits a tremendous increase in the precision of measuring change within a single person by repeatedly, safety, and efficiently scanning the brain over time.

While the idea of smart environments is now a reality, there remain gaps in our knowledge about how to scale smart homes technologies for use in complex settings and to use machine learning and activity learning technologies to design automated health assessment and intervention strategies. The primary objective of the parent study is to design a “clinician in the loop” smart home to empower individuals in managing their chronic health conditions by automating health monitoring, assessment, and evaluation of intervention impact. This supplement extends our design to monitor, assess, and intervene for individuals with ADRDs and their caregivers. Building on our prior work, the approach will be to generate analytics describing an individual's behavior routine using smart homes, smartwatches, and activity learning (Aim 1). Our trained clinicians will use the analytics to train algorithms for health assessment (Aim 2). In addition, we will introduce brain health interventions to extend brain health and objectively capture intervention both adherence and caregiver support (Aim 3). Clinician guidance is used to train machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize health events (Aim 4). Given the unique challenges that will arise when we include individuals with ADRDs, we also introduce novel methods to track multiple residents in smart environments (Aim 5) and compare behaviors between individuals with ADRDs and the original sample of older adults with chronic health conditions (Aim 6). These contributions are significant because they can extend the health self-management of our aging society through proactive health care and real-time intervention, and reduce the emotional and financial burden for caregivers and society. Given nursing home care costs, the impact of family-based care, and the importance that people place on staying at home, technologies that increase functional independence and thus support aging in place while improving quality of life for both individuals and their caregivers are of significant value to both individuals and society. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposed supplement builds on a parent “clinician-in-the-loop” smart home study that automatically identifies health events for adults with chronic conditions in their own homes. In this supplement, we will use clinician-guided smart home technology to recognize health events and the impact of a brain health intervention for adults with ADRDs. This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings to generate analytics which reflect behavior routines and can be used for automated health assessment. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",A clinician-in-the-loop smart home to support health monitoring and intervention for chronic conditions: Supplement to focus on Alzheimer's and/or other dementias,10086759,R01NR016732,"['behavioral monitoring ', ' Behavior monitoring ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' brain behavior ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' intervention effect ', ' precision interventions ', ' personalized intervention ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' brain health ', ' study population ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' care costs ', ' health assessment ', ' age in place ', ' aging in place ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' learning algorithm ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' algorithm training ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Home Nursing Care ', ' Non-Professional Home Care ', ' Non-Professional Homecare ', ' Nonprofessional Home Care ', ' Nonprofessional Homecare ', ' Nursing Homecare ', ' Intelligence ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' Label ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Early Intervention ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' technology implementation ', ' technology validation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' ']",NINR,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,366710,WA-05,-0.01173723291380547
"Improving Health Outcomes for an Aging Population OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Drug Treatments and the Impact of COVID-19 on Alzheimer’s Patients and Other Vulnerable Populations Interventions in health policy and care management have the potential to reduce COVID-19 infections and deaths, particularly if they can be targeted to the most vulnerable populations such as patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). In this supplement proposal, we compile information and develop tools that can accelerate and target such interventions. The first aim is to identify the medical and socioeconomic characteristics of people that make them most vulnerable to COVID-19. We create cohorts of patients with ADRD and for other vulnerable populations based on their Fall 2019 characteristics, and follow them through 2020 to identify those at greatest risk of both “direct” COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., critical illness, mortality) and “indirect” increases in non-COVID outcomes. The second aim is an ambitious proof of concept: using natural experiments to shed light on novel drugs to treat or prevent COVID-19 with a particular focus on drugs most heavily used by ADRD patients (e.g., anticholinesterase inhibitors). We will develop and apply a machine learning approach to test the potential effect of drug classes on COVID-19, measured by diagnosis, hospitalization, ICU admission, and death. This supplement is made possible by a unique opportunity: Access to near-real-time Medicare claims data (one-month lag), which CMS appears willing to make available through an expedited data use agreement. The application will supplement an ongoing program project on Improving Health Outcome for an Aging Population, whose overarching aim is to better understand health trends and disparities, determinants of health, and approaches to improving health for an aging population in an evolving landscape. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative This administrative supplement seeks to better understand factors mediating (and exacerbating) the impact of COVID-19 on patient cohorts with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and other vulnerable characteristics.

"Development of a reminiscence therapy online platform with machine learning to increase engagement with people living with dementia and their care partners PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 6 million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementias, and the number of affected individuals is rapidly growing. Symptoms include impaired cognition, resulting in difficulty in performing daily activities and consequent functional dependence on others. The progressive nature of AD and ADRD can result in increasing degrees of care required from professional and family caregivers. Non- pharmacologic interventions positively influence cognition, mood, and other behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, and one well-established intervention, life story work (the use of written and oral life histories), serves as an effective technique that can elicit conversation and memories in those with AD and ADRD. However, generating useful life story materials is a time-consuming task for caregivers. To overcome this barrier, LifeBio Inc. is developing a reminiscence therapy platform —LifeBio MemoryTM— with a novel machine-learning-based application that converts speech to text and generates life stories to serve as an interactive tool to cultivate communication between people living with dementia and their family and caregivers. The LifeBio MemoryTM platform application will elicit and store individuals’ stories, photos, and videos and ultimately deliver personalized, point-of-care reminiscence therapy exercises for patients. In preliminary work supporting this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Inc. partnered with the Benjamin Rose Institute on Aging to conduct a pilot study in nursing homes, which showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms among participants in LifeBio Inc.’s intervention and revealed that the majority of participants considered knowledge of their life story to be important for caregivers, while caregivers also reported positive experiences in relation to the impact of the intervention on caregiving. In this project we will: 1) Develop prototype enhancements of the existing LifeBio program and conduct focus group evaluations of these prototypes with 12 existing or former LifeBio users, 20 dementia care professionals familiar with LifeBio and 6 older adults with early-stage dementia to help maintain person-centered practices throughout the research process; 2) Finalize the LifeBio Memory product, which will include the development of a system to automatically record and process individuals’ life stories. 3) Conduct a full-scale fidelity trial of the complete package with 40 care professionals and 160 dementia care dyads across within an assisted living setting. The product of this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, LifeBio Memory™, will be a novel, scalable, and easily implemented solution through which caregivers and healthcare providers can offer person-centered care to people living with AD and AD-related dementias. PROJECT NARRATIVE Non-pharmacological interventions and person-centered care strategies are important elements of care for people with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.

"Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer's (SARA) Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this Phase I Socially-Assistive Robots for Alzheimer’s (SARA) effort is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of a socially integrative and supportive robot system to enhance the connectedness, caregiving, well-being, and quality of life of older adults experiencing early to middle stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD). One in 10 people 65 and older has AD, with estimates of up to as many as 5.5 million Americans currently living with AD. Because of the loss of cognitive function and subsequent changes in employment and reduced engagement with social groups and hobbies, AD/ADRD patients often experience loneliness and social isolation, and the considerable challenge of caring for these individuals often causes similar effects in caregivers. If successful, SARA will have significant impact on AD/ADRD patient care and quality of life, reducing loneliness and social isolation.  The specific aims of this two-year pilot study are to: (1) adapt commercial robot and peripheral hardware to create accessible interactions for AD/ADRD patients; (2) design and develop the robot interaction software to provide rich, supportive interaction; and (3) assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of SARA with AD/ADRD older adults and their caregivers. SARA employs user-community-driven design processes and evaluations to address key challenges surrounding how to best apply commercial robots and engaging interaction methodologies to improve AD/ADRD patient care. We will develop SARA through an iterative development process that produces and evaluates three versions of the system during the Phase I effort.  SARA is significant in three ways. SARA reduces loneliness by providing robotic social interactions. SARA reduces social isolation by connecting the patient more closely with family, friends, and caregivers, both directly and through social media. SARA provides social assistance in three ways: (1) through automated reminders and question answering for everyday information that is easily and often forgotten by patients; (2) conveyance of health regimens (e.g., What can I have for lunch? Should I still exercise today?); and (3) monitoring for caregivers.  SARA contains three central innovations. First, to create a user experience that is well tuned to the needs of patients and caregivers, SARA is created with significant feedback from AD/ADRD patients and caregivers. Second, to enable us to build on multiple robotic platforms that can meet this user experience, and to provide future extensibility, SARA features a platform-agnostic software and hardware framework that can integrate with a wide range of consumer social robots. Third, to create engaging, believable, and effective interactions with AD/ADRD patients, SARA uses and extends an AI-based architecture, Hap, which is specifically designed to create socially engaging interactive characters and robots that provide enjoyable and stimulating interactions. Project Narrative  As many as 5.5 million Americans may have Alzheimer’s disease, an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking skills, eventually impairing the ability to carry out even the simplest tasks.

"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and

"Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) are age-associated neurodegenerative diseases that are reaching epidemic proportions. Progression of AD is characterized by losses in memory, orientation, independent decision-making capacity, and self-care. Gains in understanding AD pathogenesis have not yet translated into pharmacological therapies that effectively slow or halt disease progression. Evidence-based behavioral approaches are rapidly becoming recognized as methods to provide effective neurocognitive and therapeutic support for AD/ADRD patients and their caregivers1.  Behavioral approaches such as lifestyle changes and risk reduction are non-pharmacological therapies that are accessible, personalizable, have no side effects, and are low in cost. To that end, we are developing mobile device software that is patient and caregiver centered, and provides behavioral-based assistance through visual mapping. The MapHabitTM system (MHS) uses pictures and keywords to assist memory- impaired patients and caregivers in organizing and successfully accomplishing their activities of daily living. This approach is innovative through its unique recruitment of the brain’s habit learning system (neostriatum) rather than the hippocampal structures damaged in AD. Preliminary work revealed that commercially available visual mapping software is too complicated for memory-impaired and technology-naïve individuals to use effectively. Commercially available software is proprietary and cannot be modified to meet their needs.  In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we propose to further develop and enhance MHS by integrating three novel specific aims that involve (1) development of adaptive user interfaces which can be personalized and dynamically adjusted for cognitive status, allowing for a greater range of memory-impaired individuals to benefit from visual mapping; (2) linkage of personalized visual maps to smart devices, including wearables (e.g., Apple iWatch) and audio interfaces (e.g., Amazon Echo); (3) establishment of a predictive analytics tool that will accurately track and predict changes in functional status.  We are advantaged in this SBIR Phase 1 application by having access to patients and caregivers, including underrepresented minority populations, who are currently involved in our preliminary studies assessing the impact of visual mapping on quality of life measures. All of these individuals are already well- characterized in terms of their cognitive and emotional behavior, both before and after the use of visual mapping (see letters of support from Dr. E. Vaughn, Atlanta VA Health Care System, Dr. M. Parker, Emory University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and F. Boatman, RN, Speak Life Management). Those studies will contribute to the preliminary data section of our planned SBIR Phase 2 application that will: assess the effectiveness of MHS on a broad range of large clinical populations, improve the user-experience for memory-impaired individuals, and refine our methods of machine learning to predict healthcare outcomes. Impressive gains in our understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have not created therapies that are safe and effective. We are developing the MapHabitTM system, an application for mobile devices that is safe, non- invasive, and low in cost, which helps memory-impaired individuals and caregivers accomplish activities and improve independent function. This is done by using a technique called visual mapping to utilize areas of the brain that are not damaged by AD.",Developing mobile software that uses visual mapping techniques as habit-based assistive technology for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's related dementias and their caregivers,9993188,R43AG065081,"['Activities of Daily Living ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' daily living functionality ', ' functional ability ', ' functional capacity ', ' Age ', ' ages ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Epidemic ', ' Feedback ', ' Geriatrics ', ' geriatric medicine ', ' Goals ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Self-Help Devices ', ' Assistive Technology ', ' assisted device ', ' assistive device ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Tablets ', ' Technology ', ' Temporal Lobe ', ' temporal cortex ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Wrist ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Neostriatum ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Memory Deficit ', ' memory dysfunction ', ' Memory impairment ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Visual ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Letters ', ' Therapeutic ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' functional status ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Devices ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Bypass ', ' memory decline ', ' Memory Loss ', ' Modeling ', ' develop software ', ' developing computer software ', ' software development ', ' Malus domestica ', ' Apple ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Brain region ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' habit learning ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' visual map ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' analytical tool ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' aged population ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' decision-making capacity ', ' emotional behavior ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' recruit ', ' smartwatch ', ' smart watch ', ' wearable electronics ', ' wearable technology ', ' wearable device ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' Non-pharmacologic Therapy ', ' Nonpharmacologic Therapy ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' side effect ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,"MAPHABIT, INC.",R43,2020,498557,GA-05,-0.03273580565407681
"Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies). PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Every year Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) adversely affect millions of Americans at a societal cost of more than $200 million.1 Concurrently, half of Americans living with ADRD never receive a diagnosis.2-7 Early detection helps those with ADRD and their caregivers better plan and potentially lessen the burden of lengthy and costly medical care. Current investigational approaches using biomarkers for early detection are invasive, costly, and sometimes inaccessible to patients. The National Institute on Aging calls for the development of effective, scalable and low cost approaches for early detection of ADRD (RFA-AG-20-051). Currently, primary care clinicians provide the majority of care to older adults living with ADRD.1-5 Our interdisciplinary scientific teams have developed and tested scalable early detection approaches.10, 11 We are proposing to evaluate an integrated approach embedded in the Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) that leverages Electronic Health Record systems, machine learning models, and patient reported outcomes to deploy a low- cost and scalable approach for early detection of ADRD. Our proposed studies will leverage previously developed machine learning models (Passive Digital Marker) and patient reported outcomes (Quick Dementia Rating Scale). The design of our proposed studies is predicated on the notion that patient screening is done to identify a more targeted group of referral for applicable diagnostic and management services. We will conduct two complementary multi-site studies to evaluate the effectiveness of two scalable approaches for early detection of ADRD. The first study will be a clinical validation study of the three scalable approaches; the Passive Digital Marker (PDM) that uses EHR data, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) that uses patient reported outcomes (PROs) imbedded within the EHR system, and the combination of both (PDM + QDRS). The second study will be a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial of two screening approaches embedded within the AWV, as compared to the AWV-only process, in increasing the incidence rate of new ADRD. In the final year of the study, we will share our codes for both the Passive Digital Marker and the QDRS with Epic headquarters to ensure that these codes are available for any healthcare system with Epic nationwide. The high costs of treating Alzheimer’s disease and the costs incurred by patients and caregivers, both tangible and intangible, are a major threat to public health and the US economy. Developing scalable and low cost instruments and assessments integrated into EHR data will assist physicians in early detection, more and better diagnoses, and clinically meaningful care recommendations. Cost effective, scalable, and noninvasive models are urgently needed to proactively mitigate these costs and prolonged medical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will consist of two complementary studies at diverse urban, suburban, and rural primary care practices within Central Indiana and South Florida. The first study Aim will evaluate the predictive performance of the Passive Digital Marker, the Quick Dementia Rating Scale (QDRS) using Patient-reported Outcome (PRO) data embedded within the Electronic Health Records, and the combined approach (Passive + QDRS) in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD), compared to the gold standard of diagnoses. The second study Aim will evaluate the practical utility and effect of the Passive Digital Marker, the QDRS, and the combined methods in improving the annual rate of new documented ADRD diagnosis in primary care practices. The project will compare different approaches to early detection of ADRD, crucial to the endeavors to stop dementia progression; it will also evaluate the low-cost combined methods and integrated approach to overcome current barriers to ADRD detection.",Digital Detection of Dementia Studies (D cubed Studies).,10092237,R01AG069765,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Gold ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Incidence ', ' Indiana ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Measures ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Quick Test ', ' Quick Test for Liver Function ', ' Caring ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' Dementia rating scale ', ' Clinical dementia rating scale ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' validation studies ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' diagnosis standard ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' cost effective ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' arm ', ' screening ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' early biomarkers ', ' early detection markers ', ' early detection biomarkers ', ' patient screening ', ' societal costs ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' comparative effectiveness trial ', "" Alzheimer's therapeutic "", "" Alzheimer's disease therapeutic "", ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIA,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,1094329,IN-07,0.07414987528970803
"Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  The world's population is aging and the increasing number of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs) is a challenge our society must address. While the future of healthcare availability and quality of services seems uncertain, at the same time advances in pervasive computing and intelligent embedded systems provides innovative strategies to meet these needs. One particular need which technology can help address is assessment and assistance with a person's functional performance. The long-term goal of this work is to develop technologies that will improve the independent functioning and quality of life of individuals with functional limitations (particularly individuals with ADRDs) and reduce their reliance on caregivers. The primary objective of this application is to develop a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and assistance with everyday activities. Building on our prior collaborative work, our approach will be to collect and fuse multi-modal functional performance data from ambient sensors, mobile sensors, free text, and assessment apps (Aim 1). This fused “human behaviorome” will provide a basis, together with observation-based ground truth, for automated functional assessment and validation of each component technology, including the use of compensatory strategies, through in-person observation and through video recording of typical daily activities and strategies (Aim 2). Finally, using iterative, user-centered assessment of prompt-based assistance, we will evaluate the ability of activity segmentation and forecasting techniques to provide automated support for activity initiation and accurate completion of everyday activities (Aim 3). The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on functional health revealed within a person's everyday environment that have not been investigated in prior work. The results can also help to extend functional independence through real-time assistance, while the outcomes can assist family planning, provision of care, and design of real-world and lab-based measures of functional performance. This work is important because of the increasing number of older individuals experiencing cognitive and functional limitations due to chronic health conditions. Furthermore, they address the need for individuals to remain functionally independent as long as possible in their own homes, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to design and pilot test a multi-modal sensor-based approach to automate functional health assessment and provide assistance with everyday activities for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). This work will demonstrate that intelligent technologies can be used in real-world settings for functional health assessment and intervention. This research is relevant to public health because these technologies can extend the functional independence of our aging society through technology-assisted health self-management, reduce caregiver burden and improve quality of life.",Multi-modal functional health assessment and intervention for individuals experiencing cognitive decline,10092007,R01AG065218,"['Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Algorithms ', ' Automation ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Data Collection ', ' Data Sources ', ' Environment ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Intelligence ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Public Health ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videorecording ', ' video recording system ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' sensor ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' functional status ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' cognitive rehab ', ' cognitive rehabilitation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Monitor ', ' Text ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' functional outcomes ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' iterative design ', ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' learning activity ', ' learning method ', ' learning strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' health assessment ', ' smart home ', ' functional independence ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' multi-modal data ', ' multi-modal datasets ', ' multimodal datasets ', ' multimodal data ', ' learning algorithm ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,600384,WA-05,0.04369696529337255
"National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, where currently 5.8 million people are living with AD dementias, and this number is projected to almost triple to 13.8 million by 2050. In addition AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD) healthcare costs for people ≥65 years were an estimated $277 billion in 2018. Although putative risk and protective factors have been identified, published studies have been unable to identify how to prevent and mitigate disease progression and who is most vulnerable mostly because the existing studies are based on small sample size and lack statistical power to disentangle the effects of different factors. Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) (a ubiquitous yet modifiable exposure dangerous to the aging brain) has been associated with decreased cognitive function, faster cognitive decline, dementia, AD, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Toxicological and human studies provide evidence of an association between air pollution and neurodegeneration, highlighting potential biological pathways that include systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. In response to PAR-17-054, our goal is to leverage massive nationwide datasets (Medicare and Medicaid), coupled with advanced statistical methods, to overcome the limitations of existing studies and clarify risk and protective factors for AD/ADRD. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will conduct national epidemiological studies using Medicare and Medicaid claims for the period 2000-2021 for the continental US, to estimate the association between exposure to air pollution and the time to the first AD/ADRD hospitalization. Among enrollees that have been hospitalized for AD/ADRD or MCI we will assess whether air pollution exposure increases risk of mortality, and/or accelerates re-hospitalization for AD/ADRD. In Aim 2 we will apply machine learning methods to identify co-occurrence of individual-level (previous hospitalizations, race, age, and sex), environmental (weather, green space, and noise), and SES risk (or protective) factors to determine which population subgroups are most/least at risk for AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression following air pollution exposure. In Aim 3 we will develop methods to overcome statistical challenges including (1) disentangle the effects of air pollution exposure from other confounding factors by leveraging approaches for causal inference, and (2) correct for potential outcome misclassification. We will conduct side-by-side epidemiological analyses using traditional methods (e.g. regression) and causal inference and machine learning approaches to understand which statistical challenges require more sophisticated approaches. To ensure transparency and reproducibility, we will provide peer-reviewed open-source software so other investigators may implement our methods. In summary the results of this proposal will characterize the link between air pollution exposure and AD/ADRD hospitalization and progression, will identify the multiple modifiable risk and protective factors that determine vulnerability in AD/ADRD, and provide the foundation for implementable actions to prevent and reduce this enormous health burden. This project will leverage data on two cohorts (Medicaid and Medicare enrollees) to characterize the impact of air pollution on risk for and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD), and identify the complex interactions of individual-level, environmental and societal factors that lead to increased vulnerability in AD/ADRD. We will develop innovative, transparent, and reproducible methods to address current statistical challenges including outcome misclassification. We will determine the impact of multiple inter-related environmental protective and risk factors to address the multi-factorial AD/ADRD health burden.","National Cohort Studies of Alzheimer's Disease, Related Dementias and Air Pollution",9942956,R01AG066793,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Dangerousness ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Inflammation ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Medicaid ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuroglia ', ' Glia ', ' Glial Cells ', "" Kolliker's reticulum "", ' Neuroglial Cells ', ' Non-neuronal cell ', ' Nonneuronal cell ', ' nerve cement ', ' Neurons ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Neurocyte ', ' neuronal ', ' Noise ', ' Ozone ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Time ', ' Toxicology ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' cognitive function ', ' Complex ', ' Side ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' cohort ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' re-admission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' hospital readmission ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' response ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Reproducibility ', ' Subgroup ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Update ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' nano particle ', ' nano-sized particle ', ' nanosized particle ', ' nanoparticle ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' modifiable risk ', ' open source ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' high risk ', ' Medicare claim ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' greenspace ', ' Green space ', ' PM2.5 ', ' fine particulate matter ', ' fine particles ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' protective factors ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,802617,MA-07,-0.03526070517975935
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults.

"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

In this study, we will use machine learning and predicting modeling and modern causal inference methods to determine which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive systolic blood pressure treatment and if angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)- vs. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)-based antihypertensive medication regimens have greater beneficial effects on cognitive and brain structure outcomes, independent of their similar BP lowering effects.",Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens,10052751,R01AG065805,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Aging ', ' Angiotensin II Receptor ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' ACE Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin I-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors ', ' Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Antagonists ', ' Kininase II Inhibitors ', ' Animals ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Calcium Channel Blockers ', ' Calcium Channel Blocking Drugs ', ' Exogenous Calcium Antagonists ', ' Exogenous Calcium Blockaders ', ' Exogenous Calcium Inhibitors ', ' calcium antagonist ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cognition ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diuretics ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Memory ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Modernization ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System ', ' base ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Lesion ', ' disability ', ' Relative Risks ', ' Sample Size ', ' tool ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' Event ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' substantia alba ', ' white matter ', ' Prevention ', ' Benefits and Risks ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' brain volume ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Cognitive ', ' Severe Adverse Event ', ' serious adverse experience ', ' serious adverse reaction ', ' Serious Adverse Event ', ' Characteristics ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' active comparator ', ' cost ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' adjudicate ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' comparative ', ' clinical practice ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Regimen ', ' mild cognitive disorder ', ' mild cognitive impairment ', ' secondary analysis ', ' cognitive benefits ', ' blood pressure intervention ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,698716,UT-02,0.0340969250550055
"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain.
